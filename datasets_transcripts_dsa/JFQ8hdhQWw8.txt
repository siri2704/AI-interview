cold Steels JavaScript algorithms and data structures masterclass on udmi it's one of the most popular algorithms and data structures courses on the platform and I think it deserves a lot of attention besides it's still doing pretty well with 138,000 students enrolled and over 25k reviews The General rating isn't bad either 4.7 out of 5 so is it any good or will you be better off choosing another similar course my name is Daniel and here are some things I'm going to talk about today JavaScript algorithms and data structure masterclass by Cold Steel what is this course about curriculum pricing and certification career opportunities student reviews and as usual I will tell you what I personally think about this course I will also leave all course related links in the description so be sure to check them out let's go over you algorithms and data structure are the heart of computer science that's what programming interviews focus on but apart from that understanding algorithms and data structures improves problem solving skills making you a better programmer today the IT world is extremely competitive that's why if you are eager to learn about algorithms data structures and searching for Great Courses I have a great suggestion for you today in this course methods of computer science and interview preparation are condensed into 20 hours of video the material is directly from cold Steels coding boot camps the computer science topics covered here are the same that have helped students succeed in the interviews at major companies like Google Tesla Amazon and meta here are a few highlights to mention this course is Hands-On you get to solve each problem before the instructor reveals the solution each problem comes with the video where the instructor walks you through the complete solution along with the solution file the instructor shares useful strategies for common problems that's why you also learn how to approach any problem step by step and finally course includes animations and clear diagrams who is this course for first of all I think that it's important to say that this course isn't for complete beginners at all the course description say that all you will need to know is some basic JavaScript syntax however keep in mind that during this master class no one is going to explain JavaScript basics to you the majority of examples offered by the instructor are in JavaScript so my recommendation is to learn the language before you enroll let me be clear you don't have to be a super pro at JavaScript but having a solid knowledge will help a lot apart from that this course will work great for people getting ready for programming interviews folks wanting to enhance their problem solving abilities and those aiming to become better developers the instructor Cold Steel the author and instructor of this master class is quite a remarkable guy he spent the last two years teaching people to program at two different immersive boot camps there he helped hundreds of people become web developers and change their lives his graduates work at companies like Google Salesforce and square and his online courses are without a doubt the most comprehensive ones on the market culum guys before we move on I try to make educational content in an entertainment way make it fun instead of boring and in return I just ask to like this video And subscribe to my channel if you enjoy the content I make all right and now let's have a look at the course content I can tell you right away that there is a lot to learn the course is made up of 30 sections they include 249 lectures 21.5 hours of video materials 85 coding exercises and 80 downloadable resources you will start by learning how to analyze your codes efficiency using bigo notation you will explore recursion in details and learn a five-step method for solving tough coding problems you will discover common programming patterns and Implement popular search algorithms in this course you will also create six different sorting algorithms bubble selection insertion quick merge and Ric sort after that you will dive into creating your own data structures from scratch including link lists trees hips hash tables and graphs you will learn how to navigate trees and graphs and study D tre's shortest pass algorithm the course also has a section entirely dedicated to dynamic programming pricing and certification all right guys like all udmi courses this course comes at a set price prices might change sometimes there are discounts so I recommend checking this master class out on udemy so you don't meet them the great thing is there is no subscription this mean that once you buy this course you will have a lifetime access to it and all its materials besides if you don't like it for some reason you can request refund within 30 days after your purchase and if you compare it to the cost of the college degree well you know what I mean jokey joke maker when it comes to certification yes you are guaranteed to receive a udmi certificate once you successfully complete the master class it's going to be a great addition to your LinkedIn page or resume carer opportunities okay and now I can almost hear you say that's nice Daniel but what about carer opportunities we completing this course help me learn a job all right let's admit it guys people usually don't take intensive courses on algorithms and data structures unless they are looking for a job this is exactly what this course or master class as cold still calls it is for to prepare you for the job interviews will it give you a 100% guarantee that you land a job no but it does give you a serious boost and increases your chances of passing a job interview this course gives you great motivation and confidence in questions that usually come up in technical interviews it does improve your programming skills it also build up the mindset you need for a successful program and job hun student reviews and now folks let's look at what students who tried this master class think about it well about 95% of reviews are quite positive lots of students priz the instructor for his expertise and great teaching style some know that this course has been challenging but fun here is for example one of the five star reviews cold is an amazing instructor I feel every type of learning slow medium and fast can can get Concepts from his teaching if you are thinking to get started on DSA I will say go for this course I'm looking forward to more courses from C keep up the amazing work but there is some criticism too some students think that some topics are not as deep as they would like some people complain about sections of the course being incomplete for example there is this fourstar review great course just wish there were more interactive assignments coding questions the there are not 85 the buying page is Rong only 34 of them are done the rest 50 plus are under development and seems to have been for many years second half of the course has no coding assignments at all so keep this in mind folks and do your own research or watch video reviews like this one is this course worth it so as you can see guys this course isn't without it problems however more or less the same can be said about many other courses you will find online is this course everything you will ever need to learn about algorithms and data structures in JavaScript I don't think so you will probably have to take at least one or two other courses learning in programs or read some books to complement this one but considering the course price I still think this course is worth it because C is a great teacher and he teaches it pretty well he explains compli at problems and ideas in a simple way and adds humor stories and fun illustrations that release to the topic and what else do you need he clearly put a lot of effort into preparing the course materials especially the algorithm explanations that's why this makes his videos a valuable resource for learning all right fellow developers that's all about the JavaScript algorithms and data structures Master Class by coold Steel by the way I recently reviewed other udmi course by called on this channel so feel free to check it out I left all links in the description down below don't forget to like this video And subscribe to my channel if you want

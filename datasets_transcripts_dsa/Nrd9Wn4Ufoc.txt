[Music] hello and welcome to my channel study with prto today I will discuss week eight programming assignment answers of the course programming data structure and algorithm using python Please Subscribe my channel if you get some help after watching this video so in this programming assignment this is the title of the program that is here and there be dragons what you have to do you have to first remember four things that is R denotes the number of rows present in the Kingdom C denotes the number of columns present in the Kingdom D denotes the total number of dragons in the kingdom and K denotes the number of dragons you have to kill okay now this is the input format uh that is r c k and D that means row column number of kill and the total number of dragon present in the Kingdom so and you can see the sample input is given here that is 5 5 to that means number of row is five number of column is five you have to kill two dragon out of three dragon here you can see that there is five rows and five columns now three dragons are present there and you have to kill two dragon now if suppose you want to kill this uh two dragon that means this and this right first of all you will be there zeroth row zero column then if you want to go and kill the two dragon in the first row fourth column and second row third column now you have to go first uh One Step 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 5 6 7 right so in this way you can go now uh if you want to kill this two dragon this and this then you have to go in this way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 5 6 7 8 so here you have to go eight boxes which is not the shortest rle right now if you want to kill this dragon and this Dragon then you have to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so the shortest rout is you have to kill this two Dron right uh by going seven step right so you can see that in the output there is written seven and in the sample input what is this 1 14 44 and 2 three this is the location where the dragon is there that means 1/4 that means first row and fourth column first row and fourth column one dragon is there now in the uh second line that is four and four that means in the fourth row fourth column fourth row fourth column one dragon is there and in the same way two three is given that means in the second row third column another dragon is there now the output is seven and this is the code you have to write I will give the code in my description you can copy the code from there also then after that you have to click this save and draft and after that you have to click compile and run when you uh click this compile and run you will see here that all the test cases are F now you have to click this submit button you can see the result I faced some problem that is for some test cases the time limit is exceeded and for the other test cases it is fast so if you can do this code in an optimized way like uh you can pass all the test cases then you can post it in my comment section and it will be helpful for the others so thank you for watching this video

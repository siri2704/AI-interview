why you need to learn data structures and algorithms first off what are data structures and what are algorithms data structures are basically a storage structure for sets of data imagine being in a library and you want to find a book you can either check every book and try to find it or you can first find the genre of the book go to that bookshelf and then you can search the book by letter imagine the bookshelves as the data structure and the method that you're using to be the algorithm and there are so many different algorithms and data structures hash tables linked lists binary trees these are important because this is the foundation of programming without a complex understanding of data structures and algorithms you're not going to be able to solve problems and write effective code and the best way to do that is by doing coding challenges and if you want an effective way to learn data structures and algorithms check out our 30-day JavaScript coding challenge where you can learn to code 10 times faster

and then ladies and gentleman welcome back this video tutorial is for students who learn algebra to equal one the order of these videos is going to go curiously in reverse order as I start to prepping students for the dias a first and then we'll start getting up some cleanup topics for students who need to get those last few bits of percentage points to hit a defect percent so the first series of topics that we're going to be doing deal entirely with the GS a we're going to be focusing entirely on something that is called transformations which is one of the big sections of the last big sections of algebra 2 goal 1 basically the short version is if we were to cut everything down into one core piece you're going to have kind of a formula as you go through it and then each piece of the formula does a thing to transform the graph so if you're looking at this there is a difference you will see over the course of this and you will also see it in the other video about functions is that there is a difference between being inside parentheses like this is vs. being outside parentheses like this is so for rule of thumb if you are inside your parentheses you're going to be taking care of your left and right shift which means that you're going to go and left or right depending on which way the sign is that you're going to be looking at similarly if you're outside of the parentheses you're going to be filling up or you are going to be wall you down again depending on whether they give you a plus or a minus so we're gonna start with that then later we're gonna talk about stretching our graphs stretching once the computer catches up to my handwriting and then we're also going to be talking about reflections Shoney's online computer ok this is valuable enough that you probably want this written down in your notebook to start so I'll stop so you have a couple of seconds to hit pause get this in your notes so that you know what all the transformations do all right now that this is written down in your notebook let's talk about how they actually work so we're gonna start first of all with one of the easiest DSA questions in the bunch but they don't make it look easy if you notice that the wording is placed very strangely here's the thing that we've talked about translated vertically upwards by six units translated vertically downwards by five units now the up and down deals entirely with this over here the K the K is on the stuff that's on the very outside you're looking at the far right-hand side of your equation in other words this takes care of my up and down shift this takes care of my up and down shift the question is now they're asking us to shift even more and that's what we're trying to keep in mind so this first piece of your equation you two x squared that actually doesn't change the only thing that is going to be changing is your plus three if you're starting at plus three and you're going upwards six units upward means that we're going to be doing addition so what is the three plus the six nine and that's it like that's all that you're doing over here again the left side of your equation does not change we started already having gone down five units and now downward means subtraction so we're going to minus 5 more units so what is negative five minus five negative ten okay that's all well good we can manipulate the equation but what if you actually have an actual graph to manipulate so we'll start with the very basics basic easy mode we're going to do only one step and again inside versus outside so you see this is in side and then the f of X plus three that is out side and what does that actually mean once my mouse catches up to my hand writing inside means you are going to be going come on left and right outside means you're going to be and down you should write that down in your notebooks it's going to be mission-critical and remember left is plus right is minus up is plus down is money so now that we have that written out what do we have over here the first one is x plus 3 f of X plus 3 that is outside which means we're going to going up 1 2 3 points there is my new shape right there less perfect less straight next up and again this is one of those ones where the computer can actually manipulate it but I can't with the spring gap here the plus 4 is on the inside of your parentheses since it's inside and since it is specifically plus that means we're going to the left so we're going to go over 1 2 3 4 units and then our parabola will be take shape from their older cheer we have f of X plus 4 that is outside which means we're going up four so we're going to take this and go up 1 2 3 4 and there's our shape over here this is X plus 2 which means we're going to be going left 2 units is now we're starting to understand it and get more comfortable in this Whittle over 1/2 and now we can make the shape from there all right that's one step what if we're doing two steps and this is where it starts to look like the essay questions because you can see over here we have both inside and outside so we have to be able to tell which is which live and in person so this is inside that's left and right and since it's plus we're going to be going to the left that's outside which it's up and down since its pluses we're going up so we're going left for up one left 1 2 3 4 up 1 there is my new shape and there is the parabola computer catch up computer catch up there we go next up root X let's see here this it's a little bit hard we've been dealing with parentheses up until this point but that minus four is inside the square root symbol so we consider it inside and since it's - we're going to go right and then the plus three is a little bit easier that means we're going to be going up three so we're going right or up three that's what the transformations are that we are doing so right one two three four up one two three there is our shape and that's how it's going to be loads okay so that takes care of both fate both of the transformations that's two of the four that we're going to be talking about now let's talk about reflections and again we're going to be talking about the inside versus outside so there is F of negative x that is going to be considered move computer in side our parentheses okay the other option so inside again we're going to be dealing with flipping left and right the other option is you would have negative f of X that would be considered outside you can tell because the negative is not inside the parenthesis it's in front of the app all the way over on the other side and since it's going to be on the outside that means we're going to be flipping up and down so that little trick of the trade the inside versus outside holds true for a lot of topics so here this is outside so we're flipping up and down so we're gonna be using our XS as our point of reflection so if we go up one the reversed flip is to go down if we went up three we're going to go down three from the axis this one we went down to so now we're going to go up two and there is our shape once my computer catches up because my computer is very slow there you go this one over here is also outside which means we're going to be flipping up and down so this is three down we switch that to three up this is five up so we switch that to five down that's what we're doing and you can already see you have kind of a bit of symmetry here which is kind of cool over here we have a G of X that's inside inside means with flipping left and right so now instead of using the x axis we're using the y axis as our changeover so this one was four over so we're going to wander over instead of right we're going to go left this was four over so in central for left we're going to go for right connect the dots and there is our point of symmetry here also that is going to be inside which means we're going to be flipping left and right this can be a little bit tricky for some kids sometimes but this is all the way over to the seven trace it over all the way over to the Senate this is at the four trace it over all the way to the floor this is also at the floor trace it over to the floor and there is our symmetrical flip our reflection okay so that's three out of the four transformations shrinking or stretching if there is a DSA question that kids will skip it will be this one because here again your inside and outside starts to effect so if we look at inside versus outside outside outside is a little bit easier because all you're doing is you're going to multiply whatever your y-coordinate is that part is pretty straightforward it's the inside where everyone goes nuts because you have to divide your X and you can already tell down over here what that means is you're dividing by a fraction and a lot of kids just their brain kind of melts when they see that we'll do the first one first so one half it's outside because you can see it's not inside the parentheses which means we're multiplying our wise by 1/2 that's the number that they've given us so this is a 0 my Y because I didn't move up or down it off so 0 times 1/2 is 1/2 over here here's my other point what's my Y my Y is 4 what is 4 times 1/2 - there's my new transformation over here we're going to be inside which means our dividing our X by one path which is a little annoying zero at least is easy zero divided by 1/2 is zero that's fun 4 divided by 1/2 let's think about that four divided divided by 1/2 computer catch up so keep change flip so that's 4 times 2 over 1 that's going to be 8 so our new term over here instead of being at 4 stretches out to the 8th okay that's what our line is going to look like same thing over here this is negative 2 negative 2 divided by 1/2 becomes negative 2 times 2 over 1 which is going to be negative 4 so instead of being over here once my mouse catches up it's going to be over here and that's the hardest part for kids to understand so taking care of that when you're doing it okay next thing if there's another question of the DSA that everyone freaks out over it's this one because now you're taking all four transformations moving left and right and then flipping up and down and then stretching or whatever all of that now has to be done at once my overall recommendation when you're doing this is to do one transformation first the easy one and then do the other so for example this one is plus 1 so plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 there is my shape but that's not my done shape now what I want to do is negative that is my flip that is outside so I'm going to be flipping up and down so if this was 1 above it's now 1 below if this is 1 below it's now 1 above this was 3 below so now it's 3 above and I can erase my old one now because I know what it looks like in order to get my final transformation here's another one we're going to be doing something similar here that is inside it is a plus 3 so we're going to go left 3 and that's what I want to start with doing that multiplying by 2 thing we're going to put that on pause so move this over by 1 2 3 is over by three movers over by one two three there is my first shape the next thing I gotta do is I gotta take my y's because this is outside and I have to multiply my y's by two so my Y here once my mouse catches up my Y here is negative four times to my new y is going to be negative eight here my Y is zero so it stays at zero and then over here my y is 0 0 times 2 is 0 so I can get rid of my old transformation over here and then switch it brush tool switch it to my new transformation and that's what it's going to look like legitimately difficult for some students you almost need a wire in your brain in order to be able to do this but that's how it's done all right next things next mix things next that make no sense now they're telling you after a vertical or horizontal transformation so that's your X plus or minus H and your plus or minus K again inside is going to be going left and right outside is going to be going up and down and now I just gotta wait forever and a day for my mouse to catch up to what I just wrote ok there we go so what we're going to do is this is the equation that they want us to change with all of this so I have to write that out first x squared and now from here to here I went right which is minus and how far over did I go I went over 4 then I went no I didn't go before I went over 3 Miss Dubois can't count good job mr. block that's a three then how far up did I go that's up so it's going to be plus and a while far up did I go that's going to be four that's what you're looking to do when you're doing this you're taking this equation pasting it in and then adding your new pieces in the appropriate places pretty straightforward so over here there's my base equation so negative root X and now I got to figure out well what did I actually do so from here to here I always start with the blue and then I go to my red so I moved left and left is addition and I left three spaces and then I went down down his subtraction you want to be very careful to make sure it's outside your square roots and I went down how many fun Oh four okay there you go and that's what they're looking for you to do for after a vertical and horizontal transformation and then again oh I ran out of space so here for this we're now gonna be actually making our graph with all of this transformation stuff so we know our parent function over here is going to be on V because this is absolute value that's going to be the shape we're going to be making kind of a V so first thing we got to do is that's a minus so we're going to go right for and then the plus five means we're going to go up five catch up computer so doing that we're going to go over here we're gonna go right one two three four and then up one two three four five computer catch up there to go there's our starting point and now now that we're on the very last piece there's a little cheat I can give you I'm gonna put this in quotation marks because if the real world ever saw you say this they would beat you upside the head with a wet noodle because that's not actually what you're supposed to call well what we're gonna do in order to cheat is we're gonna call this slope because that calls into your brain rise over run which is what this is going to affect so from this point I'm gonna go up one two three and then over one and since it's a V over one and there is our absolute value I'll repeat now we get to do it again for this one so make a quick graph pretend that it's straight which it's absolutely not let me fix that good computer okay this is Plus which means we're going to the left because we're inside the absolute value so they're going to be going left to the minus means we're going to be going down four and then the negative three again we're going to cheat we're gonna call it our slope so what that means now I did not write my graph right this is gonna suck so first things first we're going to the left two one two and then we're going to go down one two three four and then there's our point to begin and then our slope from here is negative three so we're going to go down to one two three over one over one and there is our graph and I just barely had room so those are all of the critical DSA questions this is basically the from 12 to 20 this is the entire back half of the DSA all right so here's hoping you can get through these topics again two of them are going to be particularly difficult these two most students tend to skip them on the DSA but now you know how to do them as always stay happy stay healthy stay safe I'll see you in the next one

this is how I would learn data structures and algorithms entirely for free if you're looking to Learn Python then I would highly recommend starting with this video if you want to learn JavaScript or CNC plus plus I'll link in the description my recommendation for winning those after you've learned how to code I would definitely recommend going to Coursera and taking the University of California San Diego's data structures and algorithm specialization it may not surprise you but you have to do this step please don't ignore it go to lead code and solve these problems please also don't just get caught on only doing the easies and explain the space and time complexity of your solution don't just cheat on it actually do it right and you will get much better results if you do that a bunch of times before your interview and during the process as well

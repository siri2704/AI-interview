now before we get started I want to share that this weekend we are running an amazing hackathon with the stream so you can register for it you can check out the links in the description below and you can go to this deaf post page everything is given over here like joining the Discord Channel taking part registering finding teammates the announcement video and the prizes so recently I made a video on like I'll be happy to provide some career mentorship like one-on-one mentorship to people so five winners and every single team member will get like a one-on-one career mentorship session we also have cash prizes worth 500 US dollars so that's pretty cool and uh you're gonna learn a lot you're gonna you know have a lot of fun and uh it's a beginner friendly as well because stream makes it very easy for you to build applications so make sure you check it out join it with your friends and if you're taking part then you know take a screenshot and share it on socials show your participation and I'm really looking forward to seeing you there foreign welcome back to my channel another new video now I am known for teaching data structures algorithms quite a lot people are loving the courses millions of people have watched it so if you haven't already check out the links in the description below but in this video I'm going to answer one of the most asked questions which is how do we practice data structures and algorithms and I won't just share with you like okay practice it or whatever I'll share with you some of the tips some of the unique ways by which you can practice it and how you can apply it in the real world so let's get started so step number one is obviously learning about detections and algorithm so you can watch this uh course that I have it's free it's on YouTube people love it you can see 5 million views already has started it last year it's currently ongoing so uh we'll be updating this very very soon so you can check out the links in the description below but one thing I want to share is there's this thing called applying and there's this thing called like also learning in public so learning public you can do via like applying stuff so for example I'm learning let's say web development and I'm making a project on it so you share about that ask questions and stuff so that's a part of learning public but coming on how do we do this thing how to build your profile and share your knowledge when you're learning data structures algorithms so step number one is blogging that's amazing so for that if you go to we make devs slash events like okay Canal how do we get started blogging and stuff so you can go to vmake devs GitHub repository slash events by the way you can find us in the description as well you can go to current events you can check out hash node blogging challenge so the idea is that you can write a blog on anything you want and we give away special prizes so for example we're giving away these nice keyboards and we've given away like some Jordans professional uh mouses and cash prizes and even Apple MacBooks and stuff so you can take part in this it's free and what I would encourage you to do is when you're learning latest you're learning some concept try to write a blog on it okay you can sign up to Hash node and you can make a series on it for example if you want you know so that is what I would recommend you to do just put value out there like someone who reads your blog they'll be like okay how to understand recursion as a beginner or five tips to you know be very good at dynamic programming uh most asked questions patterns I saw while solving array questions so these are some ideas that I'm giving you and when you take part in hash note blocking challenges we select like seven eight ten people every month we give them swag also we select like some winners for the amazing prizes we select some overall winners track specific winners so there's huge possibility for you to win some exciting prizes as well as you can see so many people have won such amazing prizes so I'd recommend you to take part in this event that's one thing okay now the second Way by which you can practice is uh we're also running one more event which is the battle snake or December tournament so you can check out uh battle snake and uh if you go to play Battle snake.com by the way you can take part in this event throughout uh December as well the announcement video you can check out over here again this is also in the events repository so what the idea with battle snake is that it's a competitive platform where you build your snake so you know there was like this snake game we used to play in the old smartphones or sorry not on the not smartphones all the like normal phones and the that's basically about it so the idea is that you interact with the battle sneak API it's very easy for you to get started you will literally get started in five seconds and I've done a video on that already so make sure you check it out you can check it out on my YouTube channel or you can just check it out over here you can see in the resources section there's a YouTube live stream by Kunal step by step guide to getting started so the idea is kind of how is DSA improving with battle snake well you can apply all sorts of algorithms like um uh backtracking um graph Theory and uh all sorts of things and also if you let's say I want to apply machine learning algorithms you can do that as well greedy algorithms and stuff that is something you can do so there's a really nice testimony over here someone wrote company problem sucks like you know I went to a few competitions it was just very boring instead if you want to practice like DSA and stuff to solve while solving real world like problems in real world like gaining Real World skills I think battle snake is the way to go so if you want to get started with this this is also very easy because we are running an event for this also so highly recommend you to check it out I'm sharing about this because right now we are running these events that is the reason I'm sharing about it okay what if I made this video like next month when the event was over okay you can still take part in battle snake they do regular contests and stuff but we are also doing a December tournament and it's beginner friendly so you can get started if you're a beginner if you don't know anything about it step by step guide to get started this is a video that I did so you can watch this one and it will help you quite a lot okay cool the next one is uh the next one is lead code so this is more on the practice part for this I'd recommend go to the Kunal the Channel that I have go to playlists and in the playlists go to my experiences section and there's this first video called how I cleared my Google interviews use lead code effectively it already has close to half million views so in this video I have shared how you should utilize lead code and stuff and how you should actually solve lead code problems so I'm not going to repeat that please watch that video in that video I've answered questions like uh Canal I get stuck while I look at a lead code problem you know I get stuck how much time should I give how many questions do we need to do stuff like that I've answered it in that video all these resources I've shared till now 345 resources all the links are in the description if you just check once okay so just check in the description once it will help you quite a lot please these are all free resources and these are all amazing like in terms of output it's pretty awesome uh last but not least is chat GPT so we can just ask chat GPT how to uh sorry I can just say project ideas this is the only Point remaining in the in the section now for data structures and algorithms so let's see what project ideas that gives you you can build a recommendation system for example that's what I did uh you can build traversals using graphs and stuff so you can make like Sudoku solver and stuff but you can take it a little bit Next Level you know like you can use your spell checker using a try uh data structure and this is a pretty basic one like this is when you're learning try this is the first program that people do um I just mentioned that backtracking algorithms and stuff we've already done this uh what you can do is with the Sudoku puzzle for example you can try to create a UI behind it so let's say you know how to solve Sudoku puzzle but let's say you create a nice UI with it I think that's pretty awesome okay just have some API calls pass it as a list and return the answer in the call and it will populate it it will look pretty so you don't have to run it on the CLI it will look nice shortest path one yeah again direct starts algorithm and stuff if you've done graph Theory then you can use that and do all sorts of things you can you know I'd recommend just taking part of the battle snake it will show you the UI and stuff as well and it will be pretty cool um Tetris game using a stack data structure that's pretty awesome and uh Huffman coding algorithm you can use to compress and decompress files you know and on all sorts of things so these are some of the ideas and stuff but I think uh the main point here being is that when we talk about projects students get the feel of the project when there's like some sort of a UI and something interactive associated with it so in addition to data structures algorithms you'll have to learn a little bit of development is what I recommend it's not really difficult you have to run the basics and it will be purely fine to get started with it so those are one of the few other things that I would recommend so let's sum it up hash node challenges you can take part in that twin exciting prizes write blogs on DSA and stuff and how to take part how do we know that you have submitted a Blog for the challenge you can when you're publishing you can just add hashtag we make devs in hash node and we will find it and you can also share it on socials whenever you sign your send your blog and you can tag hash node and you can tag we made devs the second one is actually the battle snake one you can take part in that that's I believe you know one of the best ways to do it and then there's lead code for which I made a video on that already everyone does that so uh make sure you watch that video again all these resources are in the description and the fourth one is like making projects that have some UI escorts related it okay so sorting visualizer and things like that these are things you can make but the catch over here is that you need to know some sort of development in order to make these projects it's not difficult if you want to learn something new and go in your grow in your career you have to have an open mind to learn new things okay so these four things I mentioned and the resources for all of these four things are in the description below hash node battle snake lead code and the other thing and thanks a lot for watching if you have any questions you can leave this in the description below uh sorry in the comment section below I'll be happy to answer that and you can check out my other channels that I have created you can go to the Kunal kushwaha YouTube and you can check out other channels in the channels section so I've made some other channels for you to check it out folks who requested it and that's pretty much about it for this video make sure like share and subscribe you can share what you learned in this video you can take a screenshot and you can share it on socials like how you are going to practice data algorithms you can tag me and create value and uh hopefully I'll see you in the hash new challenges in the battle snake tournament it's running for December the hash node one we do every month looking forward to seeing you there and uh hoping to give you some exciting prizes and I'll see you in the next one have a great day foreign

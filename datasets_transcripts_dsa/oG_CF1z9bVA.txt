this is the graph and we need to find the minum cost spanning tree the rules are number of steps equal to number of vertices minus one - 1 that is equal to 5 so there are five steps in step one first of all we need to choose the minimum cost among all the ages that is B and C insert b c that is B and C connected with the cost one next we need to find out the next minimum cost from B and C connected minimum that is from the B or C from the B there are three and four from the C there are four and six so we can choose three next step is we need to choose the minimum connected cost that is here three is the minimum con C insert b a BC connected with the cost one then b and a connected with the cost three now we need to check the next minimum among a b c from a 5 6 from B uh 4 uh from C 4 and six so we need to choose four either you can choose this four or this four you can choose any one of them that is choose this one that is inser b f that is B and C connected with the one b and a 3 b and a is connected with four there are two step are remaining so step four we need to check next minimum among a b c f next minimum is from a 2 5 4 5 from a 356 from B uh 143 from c46 so minimum is two insert insert EF AP that is B C1 B last step that is step five now we need to choose the next minimum am all other ver a b c e f here the next minimum is uh that is uh from a There is five if you choose five then this is connected FD FD if we choose this five and we'll get answer insert FD that is we now the total cost is that is uh 1 + 3 1 + 3 + 4 + uh 4 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 that is equal to 8 10 15 and total cost is 15

what is asymptotic analysis the asymptotic analysis helps us understand and predict the performance of an algorithm now why do we need ASM totic analysis to know how much time an algorithm can take which is referred to as time complexity and how much space does it required which is space complexity now let's understand what are all the key notations so there are three ASM totic notations beo Theta and Omega let's look at the function Expressions here bigo represents the upper bound of an algorithm's grow rate Theta gives the exact bound of an algorithm growth rate it means the function FN grows at the same rate as GN in case of Omega Omega represents the lower bound of an algorithm's growth rate it ensures that the function FN grows at least as fast as GN let's look at an example here of linear search algorithm if we search for let's say 12 which is neither the best case or worst case so we can calculate the average case scenario and say that the linear search takes Theta of n time

 Dear students, welcome to Gate Smashers  In this video I am going to explain  Divide and conquer approach  So what is divide and conquer approach?  It is an approach to design an algorithm  Like we use greedy approach  Dynamic programming approach  Backtracking approach So first you have to  Whether you are preparing for college 
university exam or competitive exam  So in starting we will talk about  Divide and conquer approach  So from this name only you will be able to understand  What we are actually doing  That my problem  I am assuming that this is a very big problem  So instead of thinking about this big problem  What you should do is  Divide this problem into small parts  Means convert the problem into sub problems  Solve those small problems  And combine their answers  And solve the solution  So it is a simple method  That my problem is P  Which is very large  Very large means  Let's say we are giving some input  The input size is very large  So what I did is  Divide that problem into small parts  Let's say P1, P2, P3, P4 up to let's say Pk  All these are my small sub problems  What I did to these sub problems  I solved them  What I did to them  Let's say I found their solutions  S1, S2, S3, S4, SK  What are these sub problems solutions Finally what I did to them  After combining  After combining I converted the final big solution  So this is actually divide and conquer  In this you can say a big major  That if these are sub problems  It is not necessary that you do them serially  Means first this and then this  If we talk about today's time  So what can we use in this today's time  Parallel computing concept is used  If you have heard about Hadoop  If you have heard about Spark  So actually this cloud computing  If you have heard about it  So what are we doing there  There these sub problems are  Parallel run and find out the output  And then combine those outputs  The key value pair concept  Works like this actually  So even in normal life  Like you are preparing for the Gate exam  Preparing for the Net exam  When you check its syllabus  Once you see the syllabus  You get scared that who will do so much syllabus  There are so many subjects  It is very difficult to do them in deep  So there is a big problem  What we did to it is a small problem  Means subject wise I started preparing  First one subject, second then third Started revising them  And finally by combining them in your mind  All topics you can say  I have made a final preparation  So that I feel  Finding the solution is easy for me  So this is actually divide and conquer approach  So this is what its pseudo code says  If the problem is small  If the problem is already small  Then there is no problem  Then you find out its solution directly  But if the problem is big  Then you divide it  Big problem in small sub problems  What is applied on those small sub problems  You divide and conquer  Means if the problem is still big  Means if you divide it in P1, P2, P3  Even now if you feel it is big  Then make it smaller and smaller  Take it to the base  And then what we do after that  Find out their solutions and combine them  Their result to find the final answer  So it works like this  So what kind of applications come in it  First comes Binary search  Find maximum and minimum  Quick sort, Merge sort, Strossen  Matrix multiplication  So we will discuss this one by one So that in competitive exam, college, university exam  Anywhere they ask you you can answer it easily Thank You.

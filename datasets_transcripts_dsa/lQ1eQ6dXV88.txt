hello everyone today will we will discuss about natural numbers DS a program so the problem statement was write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural numbers okay so by uh thinking about natural numbers word all will confus okay what are natural numbers we don't know so natur numbers are nothing but numbers that you can count so zero will not come into the natural numbers part okay because Zer you can't count right so the first 10 natural numbers are 1 to 10 okay the first 100 natural numbers are 1 to 100 okay so as you know what are the first 10 natural numbers you need not to take input from the conso so I am importing util package doar means I want to have all the um modules or CLA that are present in the util package okay hello word is the class name and we are using by default main function along with this command line arguments okay then what we have taken we have taken a uh some variable which is of integer type and we have assign zero then so as I told you I want some of first 10 natural numbers that is the reason I have given 10 okay so normally 10 natural numbers will come like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 right so as all the natural numbers are in um line wise manner you can take for Loop okay for that I equal to 1 because natural numbers will start from one if the numbers is starting from zero then you have to put like this I equal to Z okay as natural number start from one you have to take IAL to 1 I less than equal to 10 because the first 10 natural numbers end with 10 value why equal to because you want to include 10 as well okay and I ++ then what we are doing sum equal to sum plus I that means what will happen at first iteration sum equal to sum now is zero okay plus I means 1 so sum equal to 1 okay then in second iteration sum equal to one right because previously sum was one now that same sum value will come here okay so what I'm telling is this statement I am explaining here okay plus some plus I now I is two because it was incremented so three now sum equal to 3 plus three present I value is three right that means six now sum = to 6 + 4 = 10 now sum equal to previous sum value was 10 okay plus 5 15 now previous sum value was 15 plus present I value 6 21 sum equal to previous sum value 21 plus 7 how much 28 previous value was 28 plus now I value 8 that means 36 okay 36 + 9 uh 4 okay 36 + 9 = to 45 okay now previous sum value was 45 + 10 = to 55 so this 55 value will print in the console so whenever after 10 it will increase to 11 I equal to 11 less than equal to 10 false so Loop will come out Loop will terminated and this statement will printed so what is the console output this one the sum of first 10 natural numbers is 55 okay see this output so this is the final sum output okay see this is the final sum output after 10th iteration so if they ask you for first 25 natural numbers you just need to change the value here okay I less than equal to 25 that's it so uh that's it for today thank you

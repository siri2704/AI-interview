hello everyone welcome back to another JavaScript tutorial in this video we'll learn about the sorted Square array problem in how to solve using it uh JavaScript this problem involves of created new new create new sorted array with squared elements based on the given input array so I'll just quickly read out the prompt version given an array of integer in ascending order write a function that returns a blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and resulting at a also in the Sorting area okay okay so first thing I'll just write uh and I mean this is quite a simple algorithm I'm gonna just quickly mention the steps empty array and then what are we gonna do I trade and then we are gonna for each Square okay oh my God each are masks for each element we are gonna Square it all right and then after processing all the elements sort them in ascending order okay now we're gonna mention that okay we are gonna say start okay did I actually miss anything iterate okay okay okay I just I'm not able to actually type properly details sorry for that I don't know why my keyboard behaves like this and then return all right it's a quite simple algorithm and if we were not been using JavaScript then we had to sort using some other algorithm like we have different sorting algorithms quick sword bubbles art we are gonna go through each of these algorithms in detail in uh next lectures okay so for now we are going to focus how to write this algorithm this particular sorted Square algorithm let's just get started audit square square all right rjs and I'm gonna show function okay it's greater I mean let's see okay advanced I can say yeah and then I'm gonna zip I equals the thing you don't know and then I'm gonna do it more I'm gonna check whether it is less than equals to the length then I plus plus this is just a basic thing I mean for Go I mean yeah before we actually get started for us to actually I trade through entire array use for loops and do uh do any particular function to entire array we use for Loops okay so for example we have this array one two three four five six seven eight nine suppose for example we have two iterate through it array so we'll have to use follow for this okay and if you want to change any of this items let's suppose for example I have to change even numbers evenly present okay in Array index starts from zero okay so even will be three even number index R3 and then after that plus two and then I'll do this and likewise all right so I hope you must be understanding so far and then let's begin all right basis when I multiply the same thing with itself the Harry star all right they are having a lot of tight errors I mean I'm sorry for that all right so we have everything we just have to sort it now start doing JavaScript we use sort We Are Gonna Save Time by doing that a minus B since we are having to sorted in ascending order I hope this much is clear all right and then we are gonna say input is equal to I'm gonna say the same thing as input all right so our function needs only one parameter so we have mentioned one parameter we are going to save it in some okay so I'm gonna quickly say a result all right I'm gonna say input and then I'm gonna just console it and there you go all right started Dodger all right you get an error what is it okay I guess we are in the wrong folder all right okay a is not defined I mean okay all right I did not close this and okay we have an extra bracket here there you go so thank you for watching my video we'll meet you in our next next lectures we'll be discussing uh various other algorithms if you like my video please do like subscribe and stay tuned thank you thank you so much

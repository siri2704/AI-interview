[Music] let's simplify bubble sort in this video to be honest bubble sort is already the simplest form of sorting where the algorithm just SWS the adjacent elements that means the elements next to each other until we arrive at the desired result it is called a bubble sord as it is similar to the movement of bubbles Rising above water displacing other bigger bubbles but the performance of this algorithm in a real world scenario is poor so consider this as an educational tool let's take a very simple example and understand this we need to sort this array in ascending order we will have to do multiple passes here in the first pass we would swap one and three and then four and two because they are bigger than the adjacent elements in the second pass we won't swap one and three because one is smaller then we swap three and two we will compare three and four but no swap is required because three is smaller than four in the third part we will check each pair but no swap is required so the final sorted list would be 1 2 3 4 as shown on screen

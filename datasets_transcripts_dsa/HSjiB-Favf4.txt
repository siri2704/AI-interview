recursion is a difficult topic for the students mostly students struggle in understanding it so I have covered it to make it simple and you have the good understanding of recursion and most of the operations that are implemented on these data structures are basically defined in recursion and they are also implemented without recursion using Loops also the next thing recursion is usually felt as inefficient because it uses stack internally [Music]

what's the best DSA progression should I go through each Road mapap node in order what you don't realize is you're actually asking an algorithms question what would be more optimal here depth for search traversal or breadth for search traversal you may not even know what these algorithms are until you get to this node or this node breath for search is probably the way to go the most common concepts are actually at the beginning imagine a depth first search traversal you've covered four very good topics you don't realize it but now you're learning about tries it's a pretty rare topic it's not super hard it's not smart in my opinion to learn about tries before you've learned about stacks these are easier and they're probably more likely to come up with DFS if you went like this path and you got all the way down here you might get to advanc graphs but you haven't even done this graph this isn't actually a tree certain topics like this have multiple prerequisites so another reason why BFS is the approach here

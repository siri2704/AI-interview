there is an order to doing data structures and algorithms don't just do it randomly the first thing you want to do is learn arrays and strings without them you're pretty much useless to optimize a lot of these programs we often use hash maps and hash sets two pointers honestly I wouldn't spend too much time with this the next one is stacks and although you only need a few questions to get good at this they're really important especially for anything depth first search the next one is linked list this is important because they're the easiest subass of graphs now binary search is actually one of the most asked coding questions because of the cool condition based stuff you can do next on the list is sliding window not a prerequisite for anything but they come up all the time in coding interviews next on the list is trees this is a very important subass of graphs next we have heaps which are really common in Facebook interviews in particular now we have everybody's favorite recursive backtracking some of the most asked questions are the graph ones as well as everyone's least favorite dynamic programming learn all of this stuff completely for free at algom app.io

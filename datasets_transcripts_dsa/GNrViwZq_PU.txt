how much data structures and algorithms did I learn to get into Amazon and Google so I learned data structures and algorithms by doing this course called algorithms 1 and algorithms 2 by Princeton University the link to the course is there in the comments I finished algorithms 1 end to end but I did algorithms 2 only partially in algorithms one I learned Union find algorithm bigo notation and sorting Etc it also covered data structures like hash TBL Stacks cues and binary search trees but algorithms 2 is where things get complicated so here I only did chapters that are actually asked in the interviews I did crafts both directed and undirected I also did minimum spanning trees shortest paths tries and substring search after covering all this I did almost 300 to 320 problems on lead Cod to get into Amazon and this count increased to 541 before I got into Google

hey everyone welcome back to the another lecture of DSC using C++ tutorial Series so this is a lecture number 15 and today we are going to discuss about the array link list and hashtable that we cover in the previous lecture so this is just a recap video of mostly 2 to 3 minutes so you can explore this okay so without wasting our time let get started so it's we quick recap and real word application as the first one that is array okay think of an array like a raw of Locker in a school each Locker or you can say row not raw it's row okay row of Locker in a school each Locker that is index we call it as like for row we call it index okay hold a specific item and the item which is in the locker we call it as a value okay and you can access them instantly using their number we learn how arore in a continuous memory and perform operation like searching sorting insertion and Del as well I hope you go through all this lecture then the next one that is hashtable okay ever use a dictionary right everyone use in your childhood as well you search for a word like we call it as a for word it's a key okay and it's quickly give you the meaning that is the meaning that we get it's a value okay that's how hash table work first hook up using a hash function we also discovered Collision handling method like chaining and open addressing as well you you go through this all the video you want to do that okay then the next one that is link list okay imagine a train where each coach is connected to the next one unlike a r where element are stored in a fixed Place linkly stored data dynamically allowing efficient insertion delation okay we explore singly W and circular link list and more variations as well okay so this is just a quick recap video so what next in the video that we are going to okay we Implement all the key problem you need for a placement interview or just you want to improve your coding knowledge so get ready for some handon coding experience so we will starting coding coding lecture from tomorrow that we cover whole topic of array has table and link l and don't forget to like share subscribe for more such videos so see you in the next one bye-bye

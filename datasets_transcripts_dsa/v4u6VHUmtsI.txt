so hello guys welcome back to the channel and today we are going to solution number so in this question and which is positive of course it's supposed to do and we have to find the analogy number and uh the same answer can be very last so we have to turn our answer is answer model or this number so Fibonacci number is nothing but it's the sum of the previous two numbers so Fibonacci number is one is one two is uh one and then you can say that 330 number is one plus one two previous two sum therefore is two plus one three uh then fifty one I can number is three plus one two five and so once three times 21 and so on 34 and so on so you have to find the Fibonacci number we can solve this equation using recursion also so in the recursion what we have to do if and if you can say that is less than two it is or we can say that if that's not the matter we can say that is n is less than two computers you can say that also zero fibonaccially is zero plus one so we can do that it is 1 then it's written one if it's zero that is zero so next up is function and how do we have to return this an Fibonacci so it's previous so n minus one is previous and then again let's check the answer is so there is dle because this is taking a lot of time because it doesn't take click a lot of time uh I think it's taking maybe because n Square I think because uh for each node then the Registries like for 50 number that is three and two then two becomes in sub part and then three becomes a lot of time and a lot of things that's why there is time period exceed so we can also solve this question without equation uh what we're gonna do is you can sort it also uh simple loops so so I'm making three uh I am let's say this is previous and current and this is next and I I editing through all the values and let's see so let's this is zero let's say previous is zero we have to find X so what is next so next is equal to previous plus current so next is one Third Way one again number is one this is our answer so next is previous plus current one then we can say that we can say that this happened then you can see that previous is changed to current previous exchange to current we can say that next previous is change current yeah and we can say that current it says to next is current because next you this uh one extra element and you can say that first Fibonacci number are not first second so let's run this and check it is correct secondary number is fun now let's submit to send check his character or not so there is some error is the thing because it's uh too much large value so we have to divide by this value that's why it's in there right so you can see that that's it but send this unless from this it's not something like this and check it's going to come on successfully and have the test is this path so that's the problem anything uh foreigners and saying this is still here this is current and this is next and next is nothing but some of previous two values and previous two values uh change the sequence wise and hyper better than I am so we can find the second favorite number it's uh is and if we return you can say that if you need to match then you can say that uh go to find one two one two three four three one number so the output should be 3 but it's not it's five the correct answer should be three uh it's running fine honestly maybe that is so next time oh yeah uh sorry sorry the problem is that the next and currents are same now that's why I saying current index of the character previous is not correct the previous so because next time currents are same yeah so you think fourth number and it's giving answer of 35 when National currents are same because next year the value is next the current index is also natural the same values you can either return either current yeah so that's enough of the video hope you like it do subscribe

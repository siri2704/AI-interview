so guys there is one amazing movie dialogue in kgf which talks about violence now similarly based on this particular video I need to modify this dialogue based on DSA so I hope you have heard about this dialogue so let me again rephrase it DSA DSA DSA we don't like it we avoid it but DSA likes us we can't avoid it hello guys my name is krishnaik and welcome to my YouTube channel so one of the most common question that I've been asked by many people whether DS is required to become a data scientist now this specific question I have got tons I mean I'm teaching in their live class when I'm probably uploading videos in the YouTube channel when I'm doing live sessions in the YouTube channel many people have asked me now this question needs to be rephrased and needs to be asked in a better way now let me just talk about it whether you require DSA or not to become a data scientist and here I will be covering lot many points so that your confusion will be cleared completely so please make sure that you watch this video till the end now guys with respect to DSA you know what I feel okay whether DSA is important or not whether DS is required or not or whether the question what you are specifically asking whether DSA is required to become a data scientist I need to rephrase this question and tell that you should ask whether DSA is required to become a better programmer now this is the first question that you really need to ask whether you are in web development full stack web development whether you are full stack developer whether you're working in Java whether you're working in C plus plus whether you are creating data science application everywhere programming is required now to become a better programmer you definitely require DSA so one important thing see in my life right how many interviews I have specifically given both in product based and service based companies it's not like that I had to prepare DSA every day you know I just prepared for some amount of time and luckily I also did not ever gave any interview with respect to DSA then also I was able to crack data science jobs so for the people you know for for whom they specifically asked DSA data structures in algorithm that does not mean that I'm saying that don't study DSA to probably get into data science if you are probably a fresher a software engineer or some experienced person who wants to probably crack some amazing product based companies like Amazon Intuit Netflix Facebook and all the first round of interview will definitely be something related to DSA they will give you a problem statement and they'll tell you to solve that and that is usually done to just check how your programming skills is and if they're fine with that then only you probably go to the next round but what I have seen is that right many people only focus on DSA I have to probably learn the data structure and algorithm I have to probably solve 500 need code questions let's say and then probably go for the interview that is good okay that is really good but don't only make DSA as one Target only one specific Target okay I want to crack Amazon product based companies I will only be going with respect to that see with respect to every product based company you will be getting some kind of role you can become a full stack developer you can probably uh going for a data science role so Amazon also has for data science role but they have a generic interview process the first round will specifically be something related to DSA then the second round they'll talk about how you have solved that problem they'll ask about your projects they'll ask about you another core skill so according to me my suggestion would be always that keep DSA as a part of your life because DSA makes you a better programmer understand in data science and full stack web development or if you're also a Java developer everywhere we write code the most important thing is that you really need to write optimized lines of code when I say optimize lines of code that basically means considering the time complexity considering the space complexity and many more things and when you are able to write those kind of code definitely a product performance will increase if you are able to make your product a little bit faster even with 0.5 seconds that creates an amazing impact with respect to your product and the type of amazing things that product can do will be quite amazing I'm telling you why because this will definitely help the company itself like see they are cricketers they are Virat Kohli they are Sachin Tendulkar there's so many cricketers right they practice daily they practice daily and then they perform well in the uh matches itself right now when the performance of that practice is there did they have to practice daily similarly you also have to practice DSA daily keep it as a part of your life because it will make you a better programmer whether you become a data scientist whether you become a full stack web developer whether you become a Java see in my life I was quite lucky I did not have to invest every day at a time right I invested initially some time then I started focusing more on the real world scenarios I became a better programmer I learned some amount of DSA itself right even in machine learning even in the data science part they even in Python there are so many different different data structures right they are list dictionaries their tuples tax cues you know even in machine learning algorithm we have talked about one machine learning algorithm which is called a decision tree internally binary trees are specifically used now this binary trees are also kind of data structures I'm not saying that data structure is not used it is used everywhere right let's say if I want to probably implement decision entry from scratch it will take it will take me at least 400 to 500 lines of code to probably write it now decision tree is a kind of a wrapper on top of a data structure itself which can directly be used and it will be used to solve the problem statement now guys whenever you have this confusion see for me even though they have not asked me in the interview anywhere about DSA they had focused mostly with respect to only data science part right they did not tell me okay this is the problem statement just try to write it down with the help of some DSA just try to solve it with the help of DSA data structures and got them try to write it from scratch or line of code no they have never asked me they gave me a data science problem statement I solved that right but if you are cracking some amazing product based companies this is the routine the first round will definitely be a DSA over there so again I'm telling you guys the question should not be whether you should learn or not learn whether DSA is required for data science or not DSA is required for everything that you do in life with respect to coding it actually helps you to become a better programmer so keep DSA as a habit every day you are probably solving four to five problem statement whether you're a college student whether you're a fresher whether you're an experienced person right whenever you get time at least solve couple of problems think what the problem is probably talking about try to write down The Code by that you will become much more better and that is what is required because see you don't know in companies you face a lot of challenges different challenges and that challenges I feel anything can be fixed with the help of coding okay so from the next time if someone asks you whether DS is required for data science or not you should basically say that if there is programming in data science if there is programming in Java development if there is programming CC plus plus then DSA is required to become make you a better programmer right and this you should probably say to everyone because see I've got tons of messages from people they talk about Krishna should we invest our time in DSA see for me I know see hardly in one interview they had asked me a couple of questions after that never in this 13 years of experience now I'm not saying that every company will go ahead and ask your DSA they are some amazing product based companies which has this which has this entire um you know the interview process where the first round will be DSA then the second round they'll go and ask more about you so my suggestion would be that always keep DSA as a generic thing in your coding career second is specialization look for something specialization even when you are in college see I've seen also some people that will just only focus on DSA daily they'll solve 100 problem statement in DSA DSA DSA DSM whether you're a college fresher experience keep DSA as a habit second thing keep one more thing as a specialization it can be web development it can be full stack with Java developer it can be uh it can be data science it can be big data one specialization and DSA should be generic DSA is a part of everything right that would be my suggestion to everyone guys again it is my suggestion it is up to you okay I'll not force or enforce something over here always do your proper research but this is what my 13 years of experience is so yes this was it for my side I will see you all in the next video have a great day thank you one doll take care bye

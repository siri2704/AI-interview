B-Tech, BCA, MCA, MSC or BSC  As soon as you get into these you start doing Data Structures Algorithms, WebD, Android.Don't you think ou should know what options that are available How many profiles you can apply to? Are only tech profiles are available or non-tech too The salaries and what type of work is there
I think there are a lot every student must explore what all are the options In today's video, we will discuss options that are available to students  If you have no interest in coding, then what options are available 
and what type of salary along with type of preparation  We'll discuss about Tech Non-Tech and Semi-Tech Profiles 
In the Tech category,we have famous Software Development Profile HFT and Quant, which have high packages. Machine Learning Profiles and QA Testing Profiles  In Semi-Tech,we have Data Analysts, Business Analysts and Technical Analysts Profiles In the Non-Tech category, I will show you Consulting and Business Development Associate Profiles. To understand these we'll consider three things : 1. What will be the work to be done which companies are hiring and salary ranges & second what skills are required which skills you have to work on or what skills you'd be interested in Third: Most important thing is this profile suitable for you on not. So let's start the video In tech category we have Software development profile also knows as SWE ,I was also an SWE : Software engineer at google And i was in Cult.fir where my designation was a SDE ,both are same so what's the work : SWE are supposed to build systems There are three phases of working : 1st is Design,system is designed first 2nd is Develop,means coding & then 3rd is testing : SWE have to test too and after testing when it's released we have Maintenance phase which is a long lasting phase So main is design ,Develop & Testing before releasing the feature This is most famous role in tech category as it is versatile  and any work can be expected from a software engineer  they can work on front-end back-end,Data,Testing  an engineer can be placed in any of the things Which companies hire for this ? Big services compies like TCS,accenture,Infosys hire for SWE and they offer a ctc of around 3.3 LPA to 5 LPA and the big tech giants like Google Microsoft Amazon,hire and give better salaries For example Microsoft's CTC for a fresher is 52 Lakh,Apple : 60Lakh,Attlasian : 82 lakhs But this is CTC,ofcourse this won't get credited to your bank. So if you want to know the practicality,i've made a video on TCS,I'll give the link is description and i've made another video on google salary.You can know the actual amount to be credited Must watch those after this video.Now Let's proceed Now what skills are required to get hired as a SWE,1. you must know atleast one programming language C++,Java,Python or Javascript are 4 famous options C++ java is used widely in industry.You have to master 1 language then your DSA must be good If you want to get hired in tech giants like Google Microsoft Amazon  because their hiring criteria includes DSA as a majority In fact many startups are focusing on DSA.We'll discuss other things also But DSA is 70-80% of your syllabus for the interview And from this i remember our DSA 4.0 Live batch is launched You can regster for this in which I'm an instructor along with Saksham from Microsoft Your classes would be live along with recordings of classes & problem solving videos You'll get Notes,Codes with both C++ & Java as options. In first month we'll cover basics of C++ & JAVA then we'll start DSA and by the last month you'll be doing advance concepts like Segment tree & Fenwick tree We'll be doing a lot of question and you'r interview preparation will be done here after DSA Computer fundamentals are required,which have 4 subjects and if you're a college student then you must complete this at best otherwise you have to do it separately.1st is OOP then DBMS then OS & last is computer networks I've framed them according to priority.If you have less time you can drop CN the most important one are OOPS,DBMS,OS and then CN after this few service companies focus on Aptitude more than DSA , but Apti is something that can be done in a month.You just have to increase your speed Speed is the most important thing here There's a new trend that companies like Zomato are asking System Design (LLD) from a fresher Not all the companies are asking so you don't have to worry but if you have bandwidth you can do SD as well But you have to do LLD ,not the HLD ..No one would expect that Main question is should i consider this profile.So this is to be asked to ourselves on the basis of few parameters which i can share with you You must have some subject in your 1st & 2nd sem such as C language or C++ ,Java Python you have to do that at best then ask if i'm enjoying while coding or not ofcourse your college teachers might not be teaching that at best,but you can watch free tutorials multiple free tutorials are available for programming language accros internet watch them and analyse if you're enjoying then you can pursue it futher but if you're not getting fun or some amusement then this must not be the right choice for you Second thing when you'll start working in office then you have to sit and code for long hours you must have seen videos such as "A day in a life" but those are very lively videos where we're roaming and playing but this isn't the daily routine when a feature is to be released then whole team is working rigrously and sometimes we have meetings with US teams,China teams..So there are diferent timezones. In those cases we have to stay up till night.So you have to see if you can code on desk you might not be interacting with customer so communication skills are not required much but you should know how to explain your code or talk to your team which are outside India You don't need an extra ordinary english but yes that much is required Then if after analysis you thing this is a good choice for you i've already told what to study Next profile in Tech category is HFT or Quant,HFT stands for High frequency trading & this is very interesting profile in this Developers made system to trade financial securities & this is a time sensitive job  & you have to take decisions in small time intervals. C++ is the main language which you should know,before telling which companies hire for this Let me tell you about the CTC .It starts from 25-30Lpa minimum & it goes upto 80-90 lakh in India Gurgaon It has a major chunk of your bonus ,which is based on your performance but some of it is fixed Fixed part is around 40-50lakhs ,this is an amazing job but has a limited hiring Companies which hire for this profile are : EbulLient securities,Tower research capital,Alphagrep, Patronus research & Kodai.so with this amazing salary & great role there must be some demerit 1. They have long working hours with 6 days a week.so work life balance is quite critical here But you can work for 2-3 years to make some good money.then keep enjoying the returns of this investment Next is they have very small team size which work efficiently & are monitored preciously for performance Thus chances of firing also increased if you're not performing good So there would be a continous check that if you're performing then you'll progress and if you're not performing you'll get fired Now let's talk about required skills : Competitive programming have a upper edge here you must be thinking if we get to do CP,No it's not like that.But from CP we can check the  logic building capability of a candidate,& how accurately he can think of a solution to a problem and in actual world we have to do the same thing.with help of algorithm you can solve the problem So they get a right fit who're good in CP.Second thing : you should be good at mathematics  Because mathematics is too much required here Here stocastic calculus will be required.  Statistics will be required. So you must be very good & strong at mathematics Sometimes these companies goes to iit's and set the cut off not according to the CGPA but on JEE rank. Like under 50 rank in JEE advance can give interview.Then the question arises, is this profile good for me? So if you're good at mathematics and you get good interest in it And you are good at competitive programming Then you can target this profile and start researching about this And you can start moving in that direction Here referal can also work like you can pitch in, but I'm a master at code forces  These are my achievements, so you can get the referral as well In tech category we have 3rd profile as qa testing. QA stands for quality assurance  when a software is made. It is thoroughly tested for any bugs and issues and functionality of the software It is not released directly to the customer And to make sure Qa testers are there  Because every small mistake, could be a big impact to the business. And in startup, it happens. Usually that the code breaks People could not order after the code break And similar issues arises So this is a important profile, but it is not in abundance to the fresher like companies do not visit directly in the college But definitely you can apply on the carrer portal. Qa testers are paid less as compared to other profile You can expect CTC of 16 to 18. LPA If we talk about companies, then Amazon also hires for Qa tester DSA is not asked much And when you join as a tester your chances of switching to development profile reduces Because recruiters look at you as a tester they'll on board you for testing profile But you'll face friction or issues while switching to development Although I have covered stories where people switched from testing to data or to sde profile.So it can happen, but there is a friction So keep this in mind If we discuss about required skills for qa testing role Then nothing much is expected from a fresher You should have good troubleshooting skills and problem solving skills based on simple data structure. Apart from this, if you know get selenium testing methodologies, oops, test driven development Then it is a plus If you know software architecture design, it is an advantage It would take two to three months to complete all this In tech category we have next profile, which is machine learning profile In which many people are interested As soon as AI started many people wanted to become ML engineers or AI engineers and many job opportunities are created When I shifted to Dubai, I was reached out by a person on linkedin Where  he required machine learning engineer with a budget of 1.5. Cr and two to three year of experience It's a very good offer For a three years of experience So machine learning profiles are in abundance In fact, all of the companies are started to using AI Companies like Amazon paypal cred hire for data science engineers. And this role is very close to machine learning engineer And you can expect 30 to 50 lpa as a fresher But if you join a startup Then you can expect seven to 16 lpa ML is a very research oriented field.  Thats why company expect you a masters degree for this You must have done some research So a bit of experience and research is mandatory in this field If you want to get a very good package But for freshers, opportunities have started to come here Mathematics is the first skill required here The model you are using, you must know the mathematics behind that And you must be able to explain that to someone else in an interview DSA is not that much required here.Linear algebra probability statistic are important in Mathematics In programming language, python is a very good choice Because it has a good community  There are multiple libraries, which you can use directly You can check out Amazon M L Summer School programme of Amazon You can get an opportunities for internship at Amazon For applied scientist role Again, that important question should I consider this or not So how you can know this If you have interest in research ML is a very fancy field to look at but There is a lot of research involved You should understand mathematics very well And know how to implement It If you have research interest You can choose this profile And you might have to do masters for this If you have interest in higher studies Then you can apply after Masters And salaries might be 1.5 to 2 times of SWE You get good salaries, but here experiences required And research as well And the downside is, as compared to sde profile Number of openings are less Because there are 1ML engineer over 20 software engineers Until and unless the company is AI oriented Here our tech category completes.If you are with the video Then you must like share with your friends and leave a comment We have shared the job description for these profiles in our telegram In which skills are mentioned With experiences You can get that on the Telegram Group whose link is in description Let's move to our second category, which is semi tech In Semitech, the first profile is data analyst profile This is very famous  Among those who loves to stay around tech, but don't want to code Coding ,dsa & development are not required much.But you'll stick to tech How ? here you have to analyse the data And then visualise it to stakeholders  And based on the pattern, stakeholders take the decision. What should be the next step of the company? So data analysts have a very important role And many companies hire for this profiles You can expect CTC of 7 to 15 LPA for fresher.Although you leave DSA, but you'll need communication and presentation skill for This You should be able to present your analysis To the stakeholders Because sometime they dont have tech knowledge They dont know about the Sql query.They just want to see the visualisation of data That you have to communicate well If we discuss about required skills Then we have five skills. First Programming language python or R Second S Q L Which has a 60 to 70% weightage in interview.And ninety percent of your work Third is data representation tools such as power BI or tableu And you can choose either one of these 4th is Ms Excel 5th is communication skills. Because the data you will be visualising have to be communicated well to the stakeholders Now, the most important question is this profile made for me So if you're scared from DSA This profile could be a very good fit for you  Jokes apart. Let me tell you how you can analyse If this profile is good for you If you love to deduce interpretations from data And make decisions Then this profile can be very good for you If you are good at SQL, like you learn it at school and colleges Which is a very simple language If you're loving to do it, then this will be a good profile for you And they work in different domains Like marketing sales finance health care. If you have knowledge in any of the domain or interest Then also data analyst profile is a good fit for you So must explore this This has too much abundance Because every company wants analysis of their data In fact, our startup learnayard, which is a small startup We also need to analyse data.How many students are there working professionals are there the responses What are the sources of traffic Whether its from website or youtube video So data has to be analysed Next profile in Semitech category is business analyst profile Also known as product analyst profile Their work is to help businesses in decision making process And to improve business operations Now this profile is sometimes overlapped with data analyst But their intent are different Data analyst jobs is to analyse the data and leave it to the stakeholders for decision making Whereas business analyst work to increase efficiency For that, they have to analyse the data also So they also need similar kind of skill set Let's discuss about their salary  Top product based companies like Amazon Mesho and zomato hire for this role And the CTC reaches 21 lpa They keep tech focus approach for business analyst role with tough interview process Candidates are expected to have soft skills and advance sql skills  So you have to make decisions also on the basis of data which would help the businesses Hence, the CTC is higher as compared to data analyst If we discuss about required skills for business analyst role It would be a representation tools such as sql, msexcel, power bi, tableu And python Along with this, you should have analytical skills and problem solving skills Basically, you should be a good decision maker Because you have to take decisions also apart from analysing the data Now who should choose this profile So if you want to take decisions also apart from analysing the data If you think your decision making is good So you can go for this profile as compared to data analyst profile Where you make impactful decision In semi-tech category, we have technical analyst profile It is similar to software development profile But it is more versatile and generic You have to work with different tools and softwares Which is required in companies internal process Freshers can get 9 to 18 lpa.And good companies like Oracle and ion hires for this role And requires skills for this profile are DSA-Array string stack queue..Good communication & inter personal skills Now who should consider this profile.This is for those who are not that much pro in dsa Because of anything They can go for this profile and transition to development roles Here semi tech category ends. Let's move to Nontech category If you are new to channel, then subscribe and hit the Bell icon In nontech category, consulting is the first profile  Their primary job is to give expert advice and solutions to businesses, organisations and individuals Which improves their operations Solve's problem or help to achieve strategic goals.

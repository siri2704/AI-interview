hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back this video tutorial is for the first half only ds8 getting through all the questions as part as many of the questions as possible so that nothing will be a surprise for you when you take basically the chapter 1 test so first things first we're going to be start talking about functions and a lot of this a lot of kids kind of struggle with at first until I give them something very easy the whole big thing about functions is that the only thing that matters is the domain so we can literally cover up the range and now we can start going through the picture and here is the key thing you always want this to be pointing points to one so points to one points to one points to one points to one points to one it's a pass it's a function over here points to one points to one points to two let me show you that a little bit clearer pap√≠ bonus in and you can see that that this is pointing to two things it's going first here and then it is going here that makes this a fail so visually that's one of the easiest things in this particular type to do over here when you think of it to as a list like this you're looking at your first letter only and the question you're asking yourself is does it repeat F D Z G is any of that repetition no pass it's a function six negative four four one is that any of it repeat no pass it's a function that's what you're going to be doing for these and they tend to give it to you basically in two to three flavors so again points to one points to one points to one points to one pass points to one points to one points to one points to one points to one pass that's what you're looking for does it repeat those it repeats as it repeats as you repeat those repeat yes it repeats that's a fail so it's not a function over here's does it repeat does it repeat does it repeat since it repeats does it repeat no pass in it most definitely a function that's what you're going to be looking for you're identifying for what functions another way visually to identify for functions is something called these vertical line test and this is literally what it says on the tin what you're gonna do is you can take what I tend to do is I kick on a computer I tend to take my ID and I'm just gonna draw a board upon and the question I'm asking myself is does it pass through more than one point so like over here it passes through two points automatic thing over here I'm trying to arrange it passes through two points fail over here mister one good pass this year one good passes through two fail not a function that's what you're visually doing passes through one passes through one passes through one passes through one pass that one is a function over here I can do it as many times as they want but wherever I draw my vertical line it's always going to pass through only one therefore it's a pass over here this is the part where it's really tricky but remember this lot dot over here is open that means it's not actually anything there it's only there if it's filled in so this does in fact get a pass but there's one over here where okay yeah that's a pass sure but what about over here that passes through two points and therefore that is a fail that was the hard one so again you know this part makes you think that it's a pass but this is the part that makes you realize it's a fail it's not a function okay moving on let's see here vertical line vertical line only one only one only one on one this is a pass only one yep this is a pass only one nope this is a fail only one ooh first try this is a fail only one nope this is a fail it's easier visual visual if you have your ID to just sort of visually scrape it along the actual function but I don't have the ability so I have to draw 106 lines now this one one of the easiest questions on the don't on the DSA domain and range domain it is worth remembering is always going to be your X and then range again is what's remembering it's always going to be your Y assuming my computer will catch up because lag come on computer good so domain again we need to have me very very technical term of squiggle brackets in order to write our first term so what's our X what's our X what's up X is going to have 3 negative 7 and negative 4 that's all you're doing for this again squiggle brackets what are wise we have 6 0 and do we need to write 6 again math so we're all set domain is going to be what's in our side just football packets we have the 9 to 5 and the 7 so milling 5 7 and then for range what are we going to have square brackets let's see we have 7 a B and a B so 7 and B and that's it for domain and range it's actually one of the easier ones next table for a linear function let's take a look all you're doing is that negative 4 X minus 3 all you're doing is plugging in every single number they give you so the first one they give us for example is a negative 4 so instead of writing X we're going to put negative 4 what's negative 4 times negative 4 it's going to be 16 minus 3 which is 13 okay and that's my first one next what do I do we're gonna have negative 4 times 0 minus 3 well negative 4 times 0 is 0 minus 3 is going to be negative 3 so far so good we're doing ok negative 4 times 1 minus 3 that is going to be negative 4 minus 3 because 1 times any number is itself so that will be negative 7 negative 4 times 2 minus 3 that's negative 8 minus 3 those are both negatives which means we combine them and negative 8 minus 3 is negative 11 and then again negative 4 times 5 is negative 20 negative 20 minus 3 is negative 23 mr. Baugh is starting to show off her mental math skills so now we have negative 2 something minus 1 and in this case our first something is negative three so negative two times negative three is positive six minus one our first answer is going to be five and then we get to do it all again so negative two times what's our number negative two minus one so negative two times negative on computer catch up on not writing that fast minus one computer all right so negative 2 times negative 2 is 4 minus one which is going to be three next up is going to be negative two times zero minus one that's going to be zero minus one which is going to be negative one let's see how long it takes for my computer to catch up trying to catch up it's trying to catch up I almost made it okay next up it'll be negative two times one minus one so negative two times one is negative two minus one is going to be negative three and then come on computer catch up negative two times five minus one that is going to be negative ten minus one negative ten minus one is negative eleven if our computer will catch up good computer all right so we're starting to class through our DSA we're looking pretty good feeling pretty confident this one tends to give some kids some pause might want to slow down a little bit we're doing effectively this topic just a little bit different so there's nothing exactly new here so it's going to be f of 4 so negative 4 times 4 plus 4 again all you're doing is you're taking your X and you're putting in the number they give you which in this case is 4 negative 4 times 4 is negative 16 plus 4 negative and a positive that means we're going to be doing subtraction so our answer is going to be negative 12 for our first answer the second one is where tech kids tend to get a little bit stuck they at least understand that the 3 is supposed to go where the X is but then for some reason their brain is just sort of misfire and they completely forget order of operations so it's worth pointing it out again for order of operations you have PEMDAS print parentheses expo multiplication division addition and subtraction when you're going through this your exponents come first I cannot tell you the number of kids who try to tell me Oh miss negative 2 times 3 is negative 6 and then you square it 2 which I hang my head whack it against the nearest hard object and say no exponents technically come first so 3 squared is 9 even at the end of algebra 2 y'all are still doing this so I want to make sure that you understand ahead of time do not make this mistake negative 2 times 9 is negative 18 minus 3 negative 18 minus 3 is negative 21 okay good we have spared everyone the headache especially mrs. Dubois now let's go through it again and this time we're going to do acute oh hey so negative 2 times negative 3 quantity cubed minus 3 lot of twos a lot of threes so what we're looking to do here again exponents come first this here is what we want to focus on first what Nate what negative cubed means is we're doing negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3 that is the whole point of this that's what we're trying to do so negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9 positive 9 times negative 3 is negative 27 times negative 2 minus 3 that's what we're looking to do so negative 27 times negative 2 some of you may need to calculate and mr. Boyd's going to show off and say that that's positive 54 minus 3 our answer is going to be 51 next one a little bit easier it's negative 5 times what number to forgive us for come on computer 4 I said they're gonna plus a plus 2 plus my math there for a second negative 5 times 4 is negative 20 plus 2 opposite signs means subtract so our answer is going to be negative 18 that's what we're looking to do okay now we're going to take this a little bit further now instead of giving a number as an input let's give ourselves a whole darn variable horror the horror what do we do well what does X become what did they give us and minus three and then the plus four drops down because it hasn't been touched yet well gosh and golly gee aren't those like terms mr. hua can we combine them yes yes we can so negative three plus four is one and there is our final answer same thing is going to be applied here three something squared plus four and what is the something in this particular case it is to Z to Z or not to Z like that doesn't something all right so the exponent we're going to take it to everything inside so it'll be 3 times what is 2 squared 2 squared is 4 Z squared is just well Z squared plus 4 can we simplify it more after this yes we can we can do 3 times 4 3 times 4 is 12 Z squared plus 4 can we simplify it anymore after that nope once we've pared it down as much as we can we are done it's a fail comfy now again we're getting used to those inputs for a function only now this time you know that inside and outside we're going to be talking about and the other half of the ds8 video that i might have recorded first instead of this one we're talking about inside and outside again here we can see that our negative 2 is inside since it is inside we are looking at our x value so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at X is negative 2 and we're gonna find it where is it on the blue line right there okay so if we're looking for G of negative 2 what's Orient's are gonna be well what's our y 0 this one is the same idea only now we are out side of the parentheses which means we're going to be looking at our Y value so now we're gonna be looking at Y is 3 so we're gonna visually look my way along Y is 3 find it on our blue line and what's our X 1 so our G of x equals 3 will get us some sort of one that's what you got to keep in mind inside is your x value look at your X find it on the blue line what's your Y if it's outside that's your Y so look at your Y find it on the blue line what's your X that's what you're looking to do so negative 2 so this is gonna be our Y Y value is 4 so if I look at my Y value is 4 there it is what's my x value 0 ok negative 2 is gonna be my X so I'm going to trace my way along the X where it is on the blue line boom right there what's my Y value 2 that's where our pulling our numbers from then we're gonna take it even a little bit further now we have contiguous functions this deals with interval notation it even says interval notation if you need a reminder from the prior video if it is open it is parenthesis if it is closed it is brackets again if you do not have it in your notes well first of all shame on you second of all write it in your notes domain is your x value so domain you want to figure out where does it start and where does it stop it starts here it stops here that's a bracket so I need that's closed excuse me since it is closed you need a bracket and what's my x value I'll trace it up negative 3 over here that is open so I need a parenthesis trace it up what's my wife what's my x value 3 so far so good range again we're going to be going bottom to top so we start starts here and then we stop here so we start here that's a bracket and what's our Y value negative 4 here this is the tricky one we stopped it fine but what do we put here is it going to be a bracket or is it going to be a parenthesis well the question I asked you is back from algebra 1 is that line solid or dotted it is solid so if it is solid is it or equal to or not it is or equal to and or equal to is always close that's what you gotta keep in mind so for this one again we're going to be looking at domain that's from here to here so we're going from negative 4 to 4 the negative 4 is closed and then our 4 is open so that's a parenthesis for range we're going to be going from bottom to top bottom is negative 2 that's open so we want a parenthesis and then what's our top our top is going to be 3 that's closed and it's a bracket ok so far so good we're looking pretty good at this look at all of that math we've done it's amazing so now let's do some more math yay all right so now we're going to zoom in a little bit and we're going to zoom in and now we're gonna go back up here so what do we have we are finding whether a function is increasing decreasing constant given the graph okay so you want to look here for this sentence here specifically it's looking for decreasing so it's going down here and it's going down here now this is a trick because a lot of kids see the brackets and the parentheses and they're like oh my god I got to figure out which is which what do i do what do I do but again the computer is going to try to trick you you're always using the parentheses so where do I start where do I stop stop and here's the other thing you're only looking at X values for this so where do I start from cube down I start at negative 5 voila where do I stop trace me wait it's going to be at negative 2 also and don't forget the comma for the love of Heaven don't forget the comma where else would we go down here and here what's my start what's my start stop my start is at 3 my stop is at 5 that's what you're looking to do and this then is going to be our answer so again you're only tracing X values and you're only looking at parentheses now on the DSA those are the only two things I'm allowed to tell you I am allowed to say X values and I'm allowed to say forum this is you have to be able to figure it out on your own after that here for this next example were looking for constant constant if you recall is flat so we have two cases of flat we have here and we have here so what are our values computer catch up our values over here while my computer is catching up we start at negative six and then stop at negative five again we know that because we're tracing our way down and then our next time its constant is going to be from negative three until one again because it's tracing its way down and that's how you're going to be doing that topic next up intercepts for a non-linear function this is another one on the DSA question where it's actually kind of low key easy so what are the X intercepts X intercepts where does it cross the x-axis gee I don't know it's so hard whatever could it be it's negative one zero okay y-axis where does it cross the y axis well gee I don't know what could it be zero over here same idea if we are looking for our X intercepts first where does it cross the x axis right here what's my x value one computer catch up computer good computer y-intercept where does it cross the y axis right there and what's the number for that that is negative one computer catch up okay next this here is the last question number 20 on the DSA everyone's favorite because they always get one wrong and one right so we're going to do this in pieces we want to look for key phrases increases steadily then levels off then increases again so there's three parts to this graph increasing flat increasing which one increasing flight increasing just this one malece helicopter takes up script straight up from the ground it ascends let's see here sever feed and then fly straight ahead at a constant height and then key phrase literally key phrase they should have italicized a to fit with me without changing height and turns and flies towards headquarters so even though it's telling you three things the chart itself is only doing two things it's raising and then it's flat so therefore it's going to be this one so if there's there's one of two places with people go nuts this is one of them if they give you something like without changing ranks and they don't actually advertise that here is another one that's more often than not is where kids start to go a little screwy with this so let's think about what we're doing driving at a constant speed stop for several minutes and then starts up again at a faster speed here's what kids will try to tell me over and over they try to say constant speed but that's not what my y-axis is telling me if it's a constant speed that means I'm consistently gaining ground and then the other thing is the distance to Mark's house so when you guys go to school and you get on your little bus and come to Cheney and you're going to school all the way over to the schoolyard you know with your little flag and everything the question you got to be asking yourself is that's a terrible school is is the distance going up going down or staying the same because you're driving to the school your distance is going down so whenever you see distance to something I cannot stress it enough if your distance is to something you start with going down which means two of these graphs have been eliminated by default so now we can actually look at this constant speed stop for several minutes that means your distance doesn't change which means it's flat process of elimination next Shama is driving the freeway at a constant speed and now we're measuring speed so speed is flat so two of these out speeds up to pass a truck which means it's going to be this one and then slows down it doesn't say anything about us often and so that's how you're going to be doing this particular topic so that is our first round of topics for DSA one this is give or take about the first 12 topics of the chapter of the chapter of the DSA and now you know how to do every single one of them without any change or any deviation and you finally wanted to start feeling confident as you take the test next video or prior video depending on the reporting poor analogy we're going to be talking about transformations which is the next big thing as always stay happy stay healthy stay safe I'll see you in the next one

hi everyone this is Anu and in this video I'm going to be sharing three resources that I used to learn programming from scratch starting from zero so in this video I'll be sharing all the resources that I used and you can use these two that will help you in your journey so let's get into the video the first course that I would like to share is MIT open courseware and the MIT opening Force wear lectures are pure gold and they are so MIT open course was introduction to computer science is the first course that I took and the lecturers in that taught everything in depth so the lectures are one hours long 50 minutes to one hour long but once you go through these videos I guarantee you that will you will be able to learn the concept in depth and you will not have to watch any other video after that so that is the first course that I followed and they cover all the major algorithms data structures and I have added the link of their YouTube channel in the description below so you can check that out as well the second course that I followed was Harvard cs50 so this is an introduction to computer science and in this particular course you will not only learn data structures algorithms but also system design networking security so you will be learning a lot of other things as well so a little bit of development as well system design as well along with data structures and algorithm so I would say that this particular course is a holistic course for anyone who's looking to learn computer science or anyone who's just starting their journey in programming and I'm recommending these videos because these might not be as popular as the other ones that you might have heard about but these lectures are pure gold lectures like the concepts that is explained the lecturers that are explaining if they have a lot of knowledge and you won't even know how time flies by when you watch their lectures and when you watch these lecture because you will be able to learn the concept in depth so not only just solving questions or clearing your next interview but also really understanding the concept which will really help you later on the third resource that I would recommend is code forces catalog yes they have a lot of blogs on a lot of different topics and not only that at the end of each blog they have also given you a set of practice questions that you can solve and again this is a gold mine of resources and the concepts that they have explained so if you're someone who does not prefer video explanations and prefers textual explanations I would suggest that the code forces catalog should be your go-to place because everything thing explained there about the algorithm data structures are in depth and once you go through these blocks you will definitely be able to learn this concept in depth and not only that you also have some practice questions so you'll also be able to simultaneously keep practicing the questions too and this is the third resource that I followed while I was learning data structures and algorithms and they really helped me a lot so what are the resources that I've followed for learning the core subjects well I mostly followed gate smashes and they really helped me in a lot of core subjects and almost all the core subjects I have only followed gate smashes so they have topics playlists on operating system computer networks database Management systems and they even have some notes so that is something that you can follow too and I know that the videos like the playlist is pretty long over 100 plus videos but then again these are very in-depth and once you go through all of these videos you will be able to nail your core subjects totally and that is something that I followed coming to the final resource that I followed for building projects well I'm usually followed JavaScript Mastery and free code cam so these are the two YouTube channels that I followed to build projects and learn development and like I said you do not have to copy the projects exactly but just take inspiration from it and build something that is unique and your own so these two channels will definitely help you in your development Journey they have tutorials that start from scratch that will also teach you from like totally from scratch how you can set up your environment how you can structure your project and how you can finally host your project as well so these two channels were my go-to channels for learning development and I hope that these will help you as well so if you made it till the end of the video do like share and comment and subscribe to my YouTube channel so that you can receive regular updates and notifications also it would mean a lot to me if you subscribe and you also share it with your friends as well and in the end all I would like to say is keep learning and keep growing see you next time [Music] [Music]

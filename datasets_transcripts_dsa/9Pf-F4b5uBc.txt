I got this question on Twitter Hey 
live overflow how good should I be   at data structures and algorithms for 
reverse engineering low level hacking   and all that stuff that's a really good 
question so let me tell you my opinion this video is sponsored by hackstreet.io if 
you want to learn hacking web security reverse   engineering and exploitation and all this kind 
of stuff check out our Discord and our courses   on hex3.io alright so first of all I have to say 
what does it even mean to be good like how do you   measure good usually in terms of algorithm and 
data structures you're obviously in a university   or School environment and good that means good 
grades but it's very difficult to say you need   this great and this is exactly what you need for 
reverse engineering that doesn't really make sense   also school grades are often about memorization 
and in the real world you can usually look it up   however generally there's one principle I love 
to say and that is the more you know the more   you know I also give an example of that if you are 
able to understand French language that can help   when you are reversing some French malware because 
there are some maybe some French words and those   French words have a certain meaning and that helps 
you better understand what the malware maybe is   doing so you never know like what what kind of 
knowledge is really useful and you can kind of   imagine if you would know everything on the world 
then of course you would be a very skilled hacker   because you know everything so having heard of 
different algorithms and data structures can of   course be helpful to recognize them in code and 
especially in assembly if you know about linked   lists and the concept how that is implemented in 
memory then it's probably easier to recognize that   in assembly and it turns out I actually have a 
practical example of that also in one of my videos   a while ago I made this pseudo Series where from 
start to beginning we basically discover and then   exploit a vulnerability in pseudo the pseudo-edit 
vulnerability and in episode 10 where we were   developing a tool to find function pointers on the 
Heap we were looking at the stack Trace in GDB and   there was something I recognized it's something 
small it's not necessarily important but it helped   me to better kind of understand like what what 
even are we looking at here and it's here I'll   be fine and it says here it's a struct rb3 so 
this is probably a red black tree which is like   something you learn about maybe in University so I 
feel like that made it a bit easier for me it was   not necessary and obviously you don't need to be 
an expert or anything like this but the more you   know the more you know also stack smashing was 
chiming in and sharing his opinion as well and   he said in his opinion algorithms are not that 
important but data structures is very important   for reverse engineering but then also that 
are two color answered that some familiarity   with most common algorithms like searching and 
sorting algorithms can be very useful you know   if you find a function that does some crazy 
stuff and you realize oh it's just sorting   these array of strings or something like this 
then that also helps a lot so it can help you   save time recognizing common data structures and 
various trees and graphs but yeah it's difficult   to say like how good do you then know algorithms 
and data structures is difficult to you know rank   this hopefully this motivates you to pay attention 
in data structures and algorithms these were one   of the more you know boring classes I guess in 
University they feel very dry and theoretical but   I mean you don't have to go for the best grade 
or anything like this but having heard of all   the different algorithms and data structures it 
definitely helps maybe you recognize them like I   recognized rb3 red black tree in the code and 
then you can again read up on it how it works   and so having generally a good understanding 
and knowing what you don't know like knowing   what exists out there that already will help you 
a lot if you're looking for more videos about   hacking and I.T security and computer science yeah 
check out some of these videos here and of course   check out hexfree.io if you are interested in some 
online courses on web security reverse engineering   and all that kind of stuff we also have a 
great Discord community so go check out hex3.io

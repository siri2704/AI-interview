okay let's talk about one mistake that everybody does when starting with DSA it's like to understand or learn DSC you can't just go and pick up random questions and try solving those questions no everything has a road map if you're learning JavaScript it has a roadmap if you're learning react it has a road map okay basic ideas you are supposed to know a before going to B okay you can't just jumble up things and go for B and then a so there's a proper roadmap to follow for DSA also if you search for neat core roadmap on Google then you'll get this link needco.io click on this here's the proper roadmap that you are supposed to follow for example look you're supposed to do array before pointers or stats you can't just start from trees and then go to binary search or then sliding window or linked list no there's a proper roadmap so you're supposed to know arrays before pointers pointers before binary search select that right in binary search also you use pointers left right so this is a proper roadmap that you can follow I think it misses one part only not before trees you're supposed to know recursion also the concept or recursion I don't see that here take care of that part only and rest everything is fine in this and I'll say

hello everyone welcome or welcome back to my YouTube channel na shti and I make content related to coding interview preparation DSA development and other college related stuff andies these are the tips which I used personally and I think so first of all before getting into the video I would suggest all of you for where I gave stepbystep process for anybody who wants to get started with DSA a language PJ a Basics n a resources and a order it will be helpful come back to this video where I'm going to share with you all some more tips to level up your preparation so let's get into the video so the first one is topicwise preparation in an order you won't be able to learn everything so you have to do topic wise preparation and so always prepare topic wise I'll give a list so already please follow that only but if you just starting and if you want an order of topics I would poin sliding windows so the order is uh arrays link list stacks and cues hash tables sorting searching two pointers and sliding Windows recursion and backtracking strings bit manipulation heaps trees or binary search trees greedy algorithms dynamic programming graphs Union find and try data structures yes so basically dat structures topics stand alms and tops problem solving tech and the second point will thousand thousands of problem there are a standard set of problems so problem Sol again under each topic there are some standard questions stand question con again I shared this resource in my last video and I'm sharing that same resource in this video which is dver street so a toet it covers all the standard problems under each topic so this way you can complete each topic so the third point so so basically with easy problems first so easy problems start problem standard p first some time by reading the problem and understanding the problem don't directly jump into coding understand the question and try to come up with the solution first so Allah just don't start coding take a pen and paper and write down Theo code for that problem you will be able to catch that L let's say you're very confident about your solution and then go and write your code and try to submit it able to come up at least try first start with thinking of a Brute Force solution sotion optim in terms oface and for solution try optimizing space and time complexity and see if you'll be able to come up with the solution already topicwise not able to come up with the solution it is completely fine almost standard problems difficult problems so don't get disappo disappointed go and watch a video solution or read a descriptive solution video solution descriptive solution so so watch the video solution understand the solution and write code by yourself and code uh I personally use lead code and I suggest lead code for everybody it's a very user friendly platform so make sure the solution is actually getting accepted you yes but in any case you're not able to come up with the code although you know the logic again it's fine so so basically problem explanation so fin comp comp comp and sometimes it's hard to solve a problem just by seeing it so it's fine go and learn from the video Solutions more soltion resource so this way you can complete your DSA preparation from higher level to topic level then to problem level so pick some random problems and start solving them we have weekly cont this way you should be able to complete your DSA preparation by following this yeah that is all from me guys thank you so much for watching this video please let me know what did you feel about this video in the comments just specifically to answer your questions I so many questions in my comment section now uh yes uh that is all thank you so much for watching this video till this very end uh please uh consider subscribing my channel uh from now I'll be regular and I'll start posting videos once in a week at least so yeah thank you so much guys

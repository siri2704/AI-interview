[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to Fuzzy Programmer i'm super excited to have you here as we continue our journey learning JavaScript together this video is part of our playlist tackling the learn introductory JavaScript by building a pyramid generator course on free code camp if you're just joining us definitely check out the earlier videos in the playlist to get caught up we've already covered some foundational concepts now the absolute best way to learn programming is by doing so before we dive in let me quickly show you how to access the exact free code camp resource we'll be using so you can code along with me step by step all right open your web browser and head over to freeamp.org once you're there log in and navigate to the curriculum section find the JavaScript algorithms and data structures V8 certification inside that click on the course named learn introductory JavaScript by building a pyramid generator you can also find the direct link in the description below got it awesome having this open allows you to read the instructions type the code directly into their interactive editor run the tests and really solidify your understanding as I go through each step in the video I highly encourage you to pause try yourself on Free Code Camp and then continue the video trust me it makes a huge difference okay ready to code in our last video we explored JavaScript arrays up to step 25 today we're picking up right where we left off and tackling steps 26 through 31 we'll be diving into some really useful built-in actions for arrays called methods specifically push and pop understanding what it means when a method returns a value and learning about a crucial concept for declaring variables the difference between let and constant these are powerful tools in your JavaScript toolkit so let's get coding all right let's look at step 26 free Code Camp introduces the idea of a method think of methods as built-in actions or verbs that specific types of data like arrays or objects know how to perform you've already used one console.log here that log is a method and action belonging to the console object arrays have their own special methods the first one we'll learn is push this method lets you add a new item to the very end of an array imagine you have a list of groceries you need to buy written on a piece of paper that's your array if you suddenly remember you need milk using push milk is like adding milk to the bottom of that list the example shows array.push 12 adding the number 12 now follow the instructions use the push method to add the string free code camp to the end of your rows array remember to put this line before your console.log rows so you can actually see the array change when you run the code okay moving on to step 27 now we learn about pop if push adds to the end pop removes the last item from the end of an array but it does something else important it returns the value that was removed think of a stack of plates pop is like taking the top plate off the stack not only is the stack now shorter but you're also holding the plate you just removed that plate is the return value when we say a method returns a value it means the method call itself evaluates to that value which you can then store in a variable or use immediately let's see it in action create a new variable named popped assign to the result of calling rows.pop then log the pop variable to the console all right step 28 what did you see in the console you should have seen free code camp why because pop removed that string which we added last from the rows array and returned it and we captured that return value in our popped variable this raises a good question what is that push return does it return the item we added let's find out the instructions ask you to modify your existing rows to push free code line assign a result of that push call to a new variable called pushed then log the pushed variable step 29 reveals the answer did you see the number four in the console that's because push doesn't return the value you added it returns the new length of the array after the element has been pushed this is super important different methods return different things and knowing what they return is key to using them correctly if you're ever unsure documentation is your best friend free Code Camp encourages you to experiment here pause the video add more things to rows with push remove them with a pop log the results see what happens really get a feel for how these work once you're done experimenting follow the last instruction for the step remove all the push the pop and console.log lines we added in the last few steps to clean up our code good clean up now for step 30 just a couple more adjustments first change a row's variable declaration back so it's assigned an empty array again second change the string hello back to using double quotes hello javascript usually lets you use single or double quotes for strings interchangeably but picking one style and sticking to it makes your code more consistent and readable okay step 31 introduces a fundamental and really important concept let versus constant up until now we've used the let keyword to declare our variables let character let count let rows variables declared with let can be reassigned meaning you can change the value they hold later on in your code but sometimes you want to declare a variable whose value should never change after it's initially set for this we use the const keyword which stands for constant think about the value of pi approximately 3.14159 that number doesn't change it's a mathematical constant in code you declare it using const pi equals 3.14159 your age however changes every year so you might use let age equals 30 though maybe not in this exact way const has two important rules you cannot reassign a const variable trying to do const name name equals fuzzy name equals programmer would cause an error you must give a const variable a value when you declare it you can't just write const my variable that's also an error using const whenever possible is generally good practice it signals to anyone reading the code including your future self that this value isn't intended to change which helps prevent accidental bugs in our project we don't intend to completely reassign what character count or rows refers to even though we'll change the contents of the rose array later the variable rows itself will still point to the same array so the instruction is to replace the let keywords for all three variables with constant and that's step 31 fantastic work today we covered some essential ground manipulating arrays without push and pop understanding that methods have return values and learning the crucial difference between let and const for declaring variables these concepts are building blocks you'll use constantly in JavaScript in our very next video we'll tackle step 32 where things start getting exciting we'll change our character variable from hello to the hash symbol hashtag symbol getting it ready to actually start building the structure of our pyramid generator we're getting closer to seeing that pyramid take shape if you learned something valuable today please hit that thumbs up button it really helps the channel make sure you're subscribed to Fuzzy Programmer and have

technology has grown much in the present and is making a significant impact on careers all those technologies came from developing new softwares and products that requires a lot of coding and programming coding and programming are languages that helps in the development of softwares and products on that note hey everyone i am ravi khandelwal and i welcome you all to yet another exciting video from simply learn in this session we will be discussing roadmap for data structures and algorithms however before we begin make sure you have subscribed to our youtube channel and clicked on the bell icon below so you never miss an update from simply learn let's look at the agenda for today's topic we shall begin our session by introducing different programming languages then we will discuss prerequisites that you need to learn before starting with data structures program after that we will discuss different types of data structures and then we will take a brief look at algorithms then we will discuss various coding computations and platforms you can take part in to hone your coding finally we will discuss some tips or advice you may find helpful in data structures and algorithm problem solving without any further ado let's get started with the first topic of this session programming languages there are various programming languages that you can learn to help your code data structures we will discuss c language c plus python and java let's discuss them in detail first up c language c is a general purpose structure programming language c language can be used to develop programs like operating systems compilers databases and so on c language has a vast library that contains numerous built-in functions next up c plus language c plus plus is also a general purpose programming language c plus plus supports seven styles of programming like functional structural and object-oriented programming is also used in creating operating systems browsers and games etc next up python programming python is the most significant programming language because the syntax of the python programming can be easy to understand to every learner's level and this programming language is also loaded with the full of libraries that helps in implementing scientific computing working and deployment of python are supportive and easy in any environment finally java programming language in this modern era java is the best language to choose nearly thousands of applications softwares and development tools are built using the java programming language the technology is primarily used in creating websites such as youtube google amazon flipkart and many more moving forward now that you have a better understanding of which programming languages you would like to code with let's understand what are the prerequisites you need to learn to get started with the data structures and algorithms first up basic syntax before you start writing any code you need to have basic syntax on your tips or you may run into various errors next up data types if you want to make your code perform various operations and you will need to understand data types and their syntax next up operators variables and functions these are the elements that makes a code functional or operational the data types are essential in declaring them next up conditional statements or loops let's say if we want to print only a specific part of the information when certain conditions are met then we can write conditional statements if else if we were going to print a lot of elements like all natural numbers from 1 to 100 with a bit of code then we can write some loops like for loop or while loop then we will discuss object oriented programming object oriented programming or oops is built around objects which are data structures that contains both data and the code next up we will discuss data structures we will start with arrays linked list stack queues trees graphs and heaps now let's have a closer look at them first up arrays an array is collection of elements stored in consecutive memories an array is the most basic data structures the majority of data structure and algorithms can be implemented with the help of arrays next up is linked list a linked list is a linear data structures made of nodes these nodes are made up of two parts data and the address to the next node linked lists are easier to work with and they are faster at insertion and deletion next up stacks stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order from which the operations are performed we can perform insertion and deletion only from the top this is also why stacks are called last in first out or lifo based data structures in stack insertion is referred to as push operation and deletion as pop operation next up queues queues is also an abstract data structures but unlike stakes a queue is open at both its end one end is used for insertion also referred to as enqueue and the other is used for deletion also known as dq this is why the queue is regarded as first in first out or fifo based data structure following trees a tree is a hierarchical data structures made up of nodes the first node of the tree or the node which has no parents is called root node else all of the other nodes can have a maximum of one parent and can have multiple children each node contains some data and links to its children's next up graph a graph is a non-linear data structure consists of nodes and edges the nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines and arcs that connects any of the two nodes graphs are often used to represent networks finally heap a heap is a special case of trees heap is a complete binary that is it can have maximum of two children and all level except for the last level should be filled a he is of two types max heap and min heap when every node has a value greater than its parent then the heap is called maxi and when every node in a heap has less value than its parent then that t is called minha now that you have firm grasp of basic coding and data structures we will discuss some algorithms we will first discuss searching and sorting after that we will discuss divide and conquer then greedy algorithm dynamic programming and backtracking let's discuss them in detail first up searching searching algorithms are intended to search and retrieve an element from any data structure in which it is stored next a sorting algorithm is used to rearrange the elements of an array or list based on the comparison operator on the element efficient sorting is critical for enhancing the efficiency of other algorithm that needs input to be sorted list next up divide and conquer this algorithm requires to divide the whole problem into sub problems and solve them and then combine them back to get a complete solution some algorithms follow this approach like quick sort merge sort and stances algorithm divide and conquer requires that there must be more than two sub problems next is greedy approach the greedy algorithm aims to build up a solution by selecting the most beneficial option greedy is best suited to problems when picking the locally optimal also leads to a global solution the greedy can also be used to solve huffman coding job sequencing and knapsack problems next up dynamic programming a dynamic programming technique that produces smaller sub problems and then uses the sub problem solutions to solve the more significant problem dynamic programming is nothing but optimization of recursion problems simple optimization can change the time complexity from exponential to polynomial next up backtracking backtracking is an algorithmic approach to recursively solving problems by attempting to develop a solution progressively one piece at a time then discarding any solution that do not fulfill the problems criteria at any point in time backtracking is also used to solve problems like end queens sudoku hamiltonian cycle etc we have now discussed both data structures and algorithms now let's have a look at top coding contest or platforms to hone your skills we will start with hacker rank then code beta geeks coding challenge code jam and at last code chef let's discuss them in detail first up hacker rank hacker rank is a technology hiring platform that is standard for assessing developer skills hacker rank organizes various contexts like rank hack fest and hack the interview next up code vita code vita is coding platform where one can compete against people from all over the globe for the world's best quarter title tata constituency services or tcs organizes code beta winners usually win prizes like cash prizes or free vouchers it also opens up a door for career opportunities for its learners next up geek coding challenge key coding challenge is a three-day event organized by geeks for geeks in gcc learners can participate and challenge themselves in solving coding problems to win prizes next up code jam code jam is a google hosted and managed international programming competition the competition consists of collection of algorithing tasks that must be completed within a specific time limit at last code sheriff court chef is a website that aims to assist programmers in succeeding in algorithms computer programming and programming competitions code chef often organizes various contexts like cook-offs and lunch time we have now discussed various coding platforms or competitions to hone your skills first up let's say if you can't solve a problem in under an hour you should put it aside for the time being and move on you can always return to it at a later time next up even if you answer the question correctly i recommend that you read the discussion and look at other solution you could come up with a better way to answer that question finally if you are having trouble understanding a solution then i recommend you to dry run of the code and this was all for

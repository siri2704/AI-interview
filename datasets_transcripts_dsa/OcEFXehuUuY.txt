good evening everyone good evening everyone so welcome to welcome to durgasoft welcome to Durga soft online training welcome to Durga soft online training myself K prakash Babu having 15 years of experience 15 years of experience as a trainer as a trainer okay so this particular course this particular course is nothing but data structures data structures with python data structures with the python okay and the prerequisite for this compulsory you should have a knowledge sir okay and a batch number one this is the first batch and the timings of this session is every day at 8 pm 8 pm to 9 pm we will have the classes 8 pm to 9 pm Monday to Friday Monday to Friday so 8 pm to 9 pm classes will be there occasionally for python fundamentals or some programming related terminology if I want to cover then I will take on Saturday and Sunday except that I want to take on certification service okay an extend after that the duration of this course is nothing but so two to three months two to three months it is going to be finished and coming to the fees you know very well it is a offer fees rupees for rupees we are giving this particular python course for you people anyway you people are going to receive um the details like uh so we are you going to continue these classes or you want to make the payment with all this information our team will trigger mail and even you are going to receive the tsms also based on your interest if you want to continue you can make a payment after making the payment you people are going to receive permanent link which we are going to take from Monday and videos also okay and our regular classes our regular classes will be conducted will be conducted from Monday onwards one from Monday we will have our regular classes okay so these three days demo will be there that is a Friday okay Friday Saturday and Sunday these three days we have demos okay these three days so we have demos are there okay so next and after that what is the syllabus sir what syllabus we are going to cover in this particular data structures and data structures and algorithms with python means I will show you the syllabus so this is nothing but the syllabus what we are going to cover just at the top level I will explain today complete syllabus explanation will be there the first one is nothing but introduction to data structures and algorithms sir what is mean by data structure okay why we need to go for these data structures with the help of this data structures what advantage we are going to get that entire basic idea related to the data structure we are going to cover in this introduction part next one after that python Basics see some people may have some 50 analogy or thirty percent knowledge in Python so for those people is it recommended means yes so just maybe you people are forgotten something or even when you are writing the logic you may feel difficulty with one or two topics in our python that's why as a part of this python course compulsory you need to have the basic idea about python right that's why we are going to cover some fundamentals related to the python Circle like 20 basic programs I will cover next and after that so some data types are there like list double set and then dictionary with the help of this we are going to cover some 30 programs so this I will take on Saturdays on Sundays like that okay because programming portrait so that's why these things will be covered on Saturdays and Sundays timings will be same under some sample algorithms from here data structures will start up sample algorithms and programs sir if I'm getting any problem for example consider I have a problem is there I want to check whether the given number is a prime number or not how many Logics we can write for this three to four logic Circle by using logic one how we can solve this by using logic 2 how we can solve this by using logic 3 how we can solve this sir the basic idea we are going to provide here okay the basic idea we are going to provide not in detail okay the basic idea we are going to provide here among these three approaches which one is the best also we will decide some okay which which logic is best suitable for this also we are going to decide that we are going to discuss in this sample algorithms and implementations like this how many programs we are going to cover 30 programs okay then directly we are going to start the data structures like we have array data structure is there okay programs on array data structures string data structure is there so programs on the string then recursion very very important and how you can able to involve this recursion sir very beautiful concept what we have in our foreign programming languages like recursion recursion means what best example sir I have some tree data structure is there okay I have some tree data structure is there like this so a big tree is there sir a big tree is there okay like we have a big tree is there so consider it is nothing but a binary circuitry like this I have a big tree is there now my requirement is I want to search for an element or assume I want to find out the maximum element sir you need to write logic only for this only for this we will write a three lines of code sir these three lanes you can repeat for this you can repeat first you can repeat a verbs you can repeat for this you can repeat for this have you observed this is called as a recursion so when you have a small Chota problem you will write a small solution for that this Solution by changing the parameters it will become solution for a big problem okay so like we are going to solve the recursion we are going to solve the recursion sir they have given a 10 digit number so I want to perform some of these two sum of numbers from this otherwise let us take so sum of 10 natural numbers I want to find out sir sum of 10 natural numbers ten Place sum of 9 natural numbers right yes again nine natural numbers 9 plus a sum of eight natural numbers right yes like we are going to divide until what sir one plus sum of zero natural numbers so zero natural numbers sum is zero zero plus one is nothing but one that will be written that will be written that will be written that will be written that will be written that will be written who called this one for them we are going to return the result this process is there right this is called as recursion this is called as recursion okay so basic idea you people should have clear Clarity how we are going to solve this recursion sir I can say in our entire data structures part this is nothing but the first part of what we have okay like bahubali movies are there right this is nothing but the first part in the first part we are going to discuss purely unfunders purely unfunders can you please confirm is this first part is it clear for you people up to this whatever I explained if you have any queries you can please feel free to ask any doubts up to this yes sir but uh will you cover the time complexity space complexity yes definitely sir it will be covered okay what is the prerequisition pythons or basics of python is sufficient hello anyone can you please hello hi [Music] yes sir I want to ask you how much python is required to join this match sir your question is how much a python so Basics is sufficient sir some 20 30 percent knowledge is more than sufficient uh up to fundamentals you should have clear clarity okay okay thank you sir sorry for any idea on the number and pandas no no no no this is not required for this course it is not required okay thanks any other queries no sir right it's good basic innocence only if conditions for Loops while uh yeah that's that is sufficient if you have a knowledge on that then it will be more than sufficient because actually fun for maybe a few uh he's attending just I won't understand he's only nine standard just I want to make you start from the return section okay okay only for the the purpose of that is uh that's what so I I'll make sure that one he'll be learn all those things up while parallely while doing demo let's see how the demo yeah yeah otherwise talk I'll switch to python batch starting with the um uh data sector yeah sure sure no problem okay thank you sir thank you sir right right so now do you know uh coming to the second part sir in the second part of python I mean second part of this data structures and algorithms right so up to this first part up to this first part so back tracking back tracking okay and then sorting and searching so next and after that divide under conveyor sir these algorithms we are going to cover in our second part okay these data structures we are going to cover in our second part sir in this case so what is backtracking very very important scenario sir for example when you are trying to search for the solution if you are not getting the solution how you are going to backtrack how you are going to backtrack that means you are searching another way another way for solving the problem okay one second I will show you one simple diagram so that you can able to get the clarity okay so I will give on Mass okay have you observed sir it is a back tracking it is a backtracking principle sir it is a backtracking principle so I will show you how it is backtracking okay maybe this image is not okay right now observe carefully sir here rat is there okay from here rat is coming so have you object this rat is moving here sir is there any position to move no then it has to come back back tracking come backward and search for some other solution sir is there any solution here no then backtracking so then you have to search for any other solution sir like this is there any solution no pack tracker sir is there any solution no backtracker like this you have to question okay like this you are keep on searching for the result no backtracking so maybe assume here like this it is coming so maybe my paths are different plus please ignore if it is not corrected like it is keep on moving and it is searching for the data if it is not found then it is going to find so from this location to this location if you want to move there is no proper directory path you have to move in this different different styles even you can see sir we have something like 80 Queen's problem 80 Queen is a problem A8 Queen is a problem in the sense I can't explain that eight means directly so I will go with the four Quints of problem 4 Queens means water here we have a chess board is there so with the four rows and four columns okay with the four rows and four columns like this we have so in this my task is I have to place a queen here here and this is the first place I mean I have to place Four Queens here so first queen I place it in the first position so is there any possibility Bhaskar can you please be on mute the movement of this particular Queen it can move in the left position sir this queen can move in the right in the down and this can move in the diagonal positions also sir remember carefully the movement of the queen next you can't place a second degree in this place if you place what will happen these two queens can follow each other so Collision should not happen so what is the next place can we place here yes no problem now here Collision will occur oh there is no possibility can I take here yes we can take next Queen can I take here no because Collision sir can I take here no because Collision sir can I take here no because Collision sir can I take here yes no Collision here have you observed there is no proper place for the third Queen then what we have to do if you are not getting solution go to the previous call Sir in the previous Cal we have placed it here now try to place here can I take here no no can I take here now yes so next Queen can I take here no sir can I take here no can I take here no can I take here no there is no possibility so now you have to take here no possibility so next you have to take here no possibility that means this first two place is not satisfied second place not satisfied third place not satisfied fourth place is also not satisfied then what we have to do sir you need to shift the first queen itself to the second position can I take here no can I take here no can I take here no because collisions may happen here yes can I take here I think yes no problem can I take here no can I take here no can I take here yes sir this is nothing but one solution for this Four Queens now you have to try by making this queen available in this third position and you have to make Try by taking the screen in fourth position also okay sir have you objected we are searching for the data if you are not getting the result then we are moving one step backward if you are getting the result we are printing the data we are printing the data okay this step is called as WhatsApp backtracking back tracking so do you know even we have Sudoku is there how you can able to solo Sudoku by using backtracking only so this kind of a programs also we are going to discuss in our courses are okay if you want to just a matter of one minute I will show you that Solutions also okay sir have a look once I want to find out sir Four Queens problem Four Queens problem solution solution I want a solution okay sir have a look once sir I need images I need images sir how many possibilities are there I think n number of possibilities are there here one of our tutors has given the solution have you observed so which is the correct solution I think we have yeah this one is the solution I think we have only one solution here but actually multiple Solutions are there yeah this one is one of the solution which we covered okay yeah anyway we will see how it is going to work okay we will see anyway how it is going to work if I want I can I can say like this it will be there sir have you observed the complete diagrams or someone is there in a video mode can you please switch off your video mode who is that can you please be on switch off your video model right sir have you object here so if you place a first two place if you are taking first to place the queen is there any possible to get the solution no so then like that we are going to search how many possible combinations are there everything it is going to search don't worry we are going to discuss that in our upcoming classes if you want just I will show you the solution okay um back cracking yes have you observed these are nothing but the applications okay so here uh find the subsets how you can able to find the subsets okay next and after that like if I am giving a string like ABC what are the different subsets are there and how to find out the permutations all these things possible by using backtracking only Yen Queen is a problem how you can able to search it okay so only basic functions are heavy object n is equal to 5 I am creating HS code and I am placing every element as X then I am going to call this en Queens problem so in the N Queens problem we are checking is the destination Richard or marker otherwise I am going to check is there a safest place is there or if you say safest place is there I will place the queen otherwise I will do backtrack so this is a recursion logic this is backtracking logs so e is a safe function we are going to check vertically up is there any Collision diagonally left up is there any Collision diagonally write up is there any Collision that's all because downwards we are not moving right so automatically it is going to check that part in detail we will discuss sir have you observed since it is a 5x5 chessboard how many combinations are there for five by five ten combinations are there then grid waste problem have you observed Sudoku Sudoku so yeah nine by nine Matrix is given and we have to find out a solution for us so this is nothing but the solution for that so by adding uh we should not repeat the same number twice in a row or column and in a main sub array like three by three okay so of course we are going to discuss in detail about this and even we are going to cover diagrams also related to that if you want to just have a concept so backtracking so we are going to explain in detail with the help of diagrams how my back tracking is going to work find permutations so find the subsets how it is going to find have we observed this one is nothing but a grid base and eight means a problem okay four by four chessboard how it is going to collide next and after that permutation so heavy object Sudoku solver like we are going to cover with the help of example so that you can understand very clearly about a backtrack so I can say one of the best Concepts so which you can understand very easily and more interesting will be there on this backtracking can you please confirm sir any doubts about this recursion and backtracking related Concepts everyone I request everyone to please confirm any doubts up to this no sir you showed code of java yes I have displayed the code of java because so this is the first batch we are taking with python okay this is the first batch data structures and algorithms so with the python this is the first batch okay okay yeah don't worry we will Implement I am there don't worry and some information I shared on the chart windows are the people who are willing to continue to this patch you can immediately start making the payments because so fees is very less right and the more interesting concepts are there if you want to continue just you can follow these steps the people who are willing to continue you can take the screenshot and you can follow the instructions yes any doubts [Applause] yeah you can do that in offline also no problem go to your insurance yeah yeah you can sir one second hello yeah any doubts is just similar language is going to change sir programming language will change but implementations are almost the same how we are solving in Java the programming language will change I will solve that problem in Python problem statement is the same yes I want to I want to go to market I need to bring some vegetables whether I am going by bike or I am going by a car or I am going by bicycle it is a matter of choosing the transportation PDF that's all but I will reach the destination that's all I I have learned your classes in BSA classes yeah okay no problem you can join and you can see the differences how it will any other queries so I am from the mechanical Branch so okay I completed my btech in 2020 so now I am uh want to move like in the software industry so I am learning the python also so I didn't get what is the use of this DSA so is this for any interview questions or any real time yeah definitely definitely so yeah please wait I request everyone to please be on mute who is that not from my side sir yeah yeah don't worry mukunda I will I will address this because majority of the students are having this doubt so your doubt is what is the importance of DSA right yes yes definitely I will address that wait for a minute any other doubts hello hello yes please completely implemented as well no no no no we are going to implement a purely in Python so DSA with the Java is already there that patch is running successfully we completed three batches and uh fourth batch fifth batch are running this is purely for python do you know python at least Basics no actually yeah better better to go for python course and then because uh some language is compulsory required sir okay okay thank you sir and one more thing is there any new best for starting the Java courses with this one DS uh already 9 30 batch is there sir it was started almost one week morning session morning session is not possible because okay okay okay sir if any evening batch has started we will okay thank you sir thank you very much sir do sir do we have a UPI payment option sir uh we have sir here you can see I think a phone pay number they have not given up yes sir one second I will I will check and I will update don't worry okay hello and one more thing my new python batch is also going to start from 14th so from 14th my new python batch is also going to be started if anyone interested you can continue on them evening five o'clock sir it is a fast track patch it will be finished within one month yeah it is both core and advances one and a half hour class will be there by two five to six fifteen or six thirty like maximum we will spend maximum time on weekends in the remaining days uh one hour 15 minutes like that session will be there so this goes from Monday will it start again or this will continue straight We are continuing this this will be continuation there is no revision for this okay in the demo session just I am going to explain what we are going to cover on all these things from Monday regular classes will be started so so on Monday is the real topics will start yeah directly real topics in the sense first to few days we will be on Basics sir yeah please wait one second everyone please wait one second please wait please wait so 14th I told right 14th April we have a new batch on python the people who are willing to continue yeah you can able to see so python core and advanced Fast Track batch so Fiji is a 5000 myself is handling this batch 14th April Friday okay 5 p.m 5 PM this is the registration link the people who are willing to continue I mean you can attend some uh four to five demo zombies okay just uh attend the demo so there I will explain what we are going to cover okay and I am updating the syllabus also New Concepts will be covered in this the people who are willing to continue just attend the demo you people will get a Clarity so I shared the link in the chat window and even it is there in our website you can cross check the people who are willing to continue you can use this okay yeah right so one of the things we think uh like the Monday match which you are telling right uh so is it any previous question or algorithm should know or something or the which batch sir which batch you are talking Monday so Monday uh the code Python and Advance right like it's no um like um nothing is required I am going to take a starting from Basics to advanced level in detail so the people who don't know anything also you can join this is the syllabus for python you can able to see on my screen okay so can we take the battery uh I'll make sure that one uh he will go through the uh like some of the reality I told him to watch in a YouTube kind of thing like a python Basics to attend for this refers to class so yeah do one thing do one thing he's able to manage because he's still 900 so just I want to confirm from you oh yeah no problem sir no problem sir but maybe data structure little bit confusion will be there uh for ninth classes from my side from my side support will be there so don't worry if you are having any queries definitely uh if anyone wants to view my previous batch videos of this python just I am sharing that YouTube link also you can prefer sure right any other queries yeah please I have a question so what is the difference between a full stack uh Python and the data structure and algorithm is it both the same or is it different uh sir IV uh someone had already asked these questions sir what is the importance of data structures give me a minute I will explain definitely there you will get the solution okay sure yeah because I would like to uh join the core and advanced python or the data structure algorithms or like the basics python so there are three categories right so I'm a bit confused which one to join don't worry so don't worry definitely definitely next query that I will resolve itself just give me sure sure yes uh what will be content of tomorrow's lecture yes it is a demo lecture so it's the same what you spoke today no no no no no I will start the syllabus sir tomorrow of course uh tomorrow means directly I am not going to start from introduction so among these topics I will pick any one topic and I will explain how my teaching will be okay so how I am going to explain the code how I am going to utilize all these uh tools which are available like that just at the top level I am going to project something like that means trailer of the movie that's all that means we need to attend this demonstration tomorrow compulsory sorry if you are willing to continue immediately you can make a payment that you can register for this course okay okay so if you want to get some clarity how my teaching will be so what is the topics that we are going to discuss how we are going to write the code is Sr is using proper resources or not so that if you want to get so you have to attend one or two days demo and you can make conclusion on Monday and if sometimes we miss the lecture so you will provide a recorded lecture yes recorded sessions will be there sir uh in the Google Drive we are going to share that um maximum some 12 hours or 13 hours difference will be there once if the session completed on the same day we will upload okay thank you hello hello yes yes yes Mukesh yes sir there is no doubt in your teaching you are excellent excellent fabulous actually I saw your uh that's what's majority of the students are asking uh I will explain next I will explain about that the importance of bsno don't worry mama many of the product companies use this C language and C plus plus uh the python they use very less I think for DSM yet for DSA python it is very less see nowadays you can able to see uh we have some kind of features like you can write a program in any domain and you can bring into a single platform right yes so that that facility is there means wherever optimization code is there wherever you have easy to understand you can write that code in that particular programming language you can bring to your project no problem at all because nowadays more flexibility is there so in the python itself some C language instructions are there internally to improve the performance yeah since Java also C language instructions are there so C C plus plus or basic fund answer but nowadays because of this some platform independent Natures are some kind of uh efficiency code understandability readability all these things are very very important right so that's why people are moving towards advanced concepts but the basic concepts are carry forwarding don't worry so this will be useful right this session will be useful yes definitely something definitely we will place in product based company right definitely sir 100 but uh we are not providing support for the placement yeah I know that but if by by learning from your this uh sessions are very simple very simple sir write down my statement if you understand these classes these are 20 to 25 chapters very clearly day by day day by day so within two months you will get a full-fledged material okay so if you understood that clearly and directly go to interview room in the technical room you can give the caption to the interview person suppose if he is asking what is recursion sir I will explain recursion with this one so example everyone will explain with uh what you can call prime number or Fibonacci Sequence or some of your natural numbers like basic program civil one will give so after attending this DSS session you are going to learn minimum 20 to 30 programs on recursion pick the recursion program which is very difficult so try to put it on the paper so definitely that person will get impressed right okay if you see this backtracking it is one of the recursion applications sir if I am not getting solution I will move one step backward if you show this diagram he will ask you to write the coder if you are a listener really understood this concept if you put that code in front of the interview person definitely he will select right what he need is is there any content in your brain or not that he is going to check yes so see if I am speaking something now among these 20 people so 70 percent are connected to me matter of 20 to 30 minutes I am speaking because of my diagrams or because of my explanation why can't you put the same effort on the interview yes yes definitely you people will get it even you will get better some star you will get that's all okay so right and if this course will be benefitable purely for final year students and the pre-final year students I request any final year on the pre-final if students are there so it is a matter of two movie tickets right just you can blindly register if you are unable to attend live session watch the videos if you are able to attend the live sessions just every day one hour you are going to watch a new movie that's all something you are going to learn that that Assurance I can keep hello yes sir it is a language independent right in the interview uh they will ask language is specific with DSA or uh you can that depends on the company sir that depends on the company if you know the core concept very well language is a matter of that that's what I told right language is a medium that's all I will explain so don't worry I will give that foreign um right okay thank you sir and your teaching is excellent sir thank you thank you I know I'm one of the students which I really impressed by your teaching thank you Mukesh thank you thank you I'm taking online session I'm taking in online everybody no no not in Hyderabad it is in Andhra Pradesh next to my uh sir you are from belur yes sir okay okay yes around some 20 kilometers from here yeah I am from Vellore it is 20 25 kilometers wow sir you're in heaven how long it is uh I don't know no no it is completely it is completely different states are of course uh around 500 kilometers yeah definitely definitely we will meet thank you sir hello sir yes sir good evening sir I'm just uh want to ask him regarding can you please provide me the running notes I've become a student of a regular class your regular class and I get the um what the running nodes please as a running notes this is the first batch I am telling right so we are going to uh start now so this was the batch already we started I took the classes from the first first year as well okay so that is why I'm asking no no no sir I'm not getting your question already you have registered for uh yeah yeah okay nowhere no worry I got your doubt sir you you have not received running notes yet right yes don't worry Raja uh today you will get it by today I am going to share running notes for multiple batches you will get today maximum by end of the day you are going to receive don't worry okay sure sure I have a question so do you understand Hindi not knowing any word or in English so can I so that was I what I want to ask that to speak in Hindi so so that you can know I can't able to understand but some we will see sir we will see that okay okay don't worry right okay sir I request everyone to please be on mute just I need to address some very very important thing sir majority of the students are having confusion about these three words okay I want to address these things so what is the first thing is nothing but sir language programming language okay the first one is nothing but language programming language the second one is nothing but uh I can say uh codings or coding area coding area very very important coding or I can say programming programming area Okay so next and after that data structures data structures these are the three important classification if you want to place in any company okay even not placing so when you are working for a project you need to concentrate on these three language means the company people are using which language okay maybe they are using C or maybe they are using C plus plus or they are using Java or they are using dotnet okay or they are using python which language they are using for developing the projects sir coding it is not independent sir it is coming along with the programming language sir this is nothing but I can say logic how you can able to develop the logic sir I have a problem I am going to give two numbers you have to perform addition sir what is the logic C is equal to a plus b under print the result this is called as logic you can implement this logic by using C or you can Implement by using Java or you can Implement by using python do you know in our durgasa after sir we have this patch is also very unique batch which is handled by myself logic based programming logic based programming so where we are going to cover where we are going to cover 350 plus programs all these programs implementations will be there in C Java and python in C Java and python the duration of the course is nothing but one month and the fees is nothing but a 2500 this batch is also going to start from Monday so Monday from 7 PM so if you are interested you can go through that one also sir what we are going to cover in this logic based reprogramming if you are getting any problem statement how to develop a logic so it is independent right you can write in C or C plus plus or Java r.net or python you can use any programming language sir same like this we have data structures also there sir what is this data structures it is a concept it is a concept or it is a technique which you are using for implementing the program sir this one is also language independent this one is also language independence with the help of this what approach we are going to get we can implement this by using C language by using C plus plus by using Java by using dotnet by using python any language you can use so same thing what we are going to learn now okay which is nothing but so DSA with the python with the python similar to these so DACA with Java course is also there so DSA with the c is there so DSA with C plus plus is there of course I am handling only these two not the C and C plus plus so here you can able to see language is a common medium so if you want to learn any coding skills or if you want to improve coding skills and if you want to use the technique where we are going to use these data structures compulsory language should be required and these two are language independent Concepts so these two are mandatory these two are mandatory but if you want to work with this compulsory language is required next and after that very very important sir can you please tell me one example for this coding can you please tell me one example for coding later I will cover matter of two minutes please wait please I request everyone to please later you can ask that outs I request I am muting every participant please wait coming to data structures sir I got a problem what is that a problem is so I want to uh Implement in my project I want to implement movie ticket reservation system okay our movie movie ticket reservation system I want to implement this so where I have to maintain a q rates so the person who is registering faster you have to give highest priority and you have to assign the tickets are consider these are the serial numbers where the persons are coming so for whom you have to give first priority the person who reserved the receipt first we have to give first pair so next level next person next level next to person this Q structure you know very well sir what is the queue structure fifo first in first out first come first sir okay this you have to implement by using the language but this concept you understood right so how to implement this we have to use data structure you can Implement in C you can Implement in Java you can Implement in Python in Java already collections are there in that we have this queue data structure still if you want you can Implement manually also in Python also we have this kind of things but how we are going to implement that we are going to discuss in our upcoming classes okay sir similar to this do we have any other data structure yes sir we have graph data structure is there sir do you know I want to move from this source to this destination there are multiple paths will be there there are multiple parts will be there which path we have to select sir So based on some algorithm we have to select the path based on some algorithms we are going to select the pathway so just a second I will show you hmm yeah you can see this one so I want to move from 0 at the location to fifth location what is the minimum cost minimum cost is nine sir assume I want to travel from zeroth location to Second location what is the cost three so assume sir some City zero to one city we have two kilometers from one city to two City we have one kilometer so we have zero ethicity to Second City four four kilometers are there I want to travel from zero to two that is my target zero is the source test station is two we can travel like this which will take four kilometers but we have a shortcutter so here two kilometers here one kilometer within three kilometers you can reach that are which is optimal solution this one right so like this only our Google Maps are going to work sir this one is called as do you know path it is going to display so these are things we are going to learn in our graph data structure so these are nothing but some examples what we have here okay data structures example priority queues all these things we are going to discuss and coming to this coding so I request same uh final year pre-final year students compulsory you have to get registered for this course because there we are going to discuss some one second one second it's not there one second foreign yeah this is the programs which we are going to discuss in our logic based classes so starting from basic fundamental addition next integer divisible like basic to Advanced all category of programs will be there starting from easy to next level okay so here you can able to see almost we are going to cover how many programs as a 350 programs as of now is there in my hand okay all these programs so Implement a program to read username and display welcome message so divisible by 3 Implement a program to read a number and check whether it is divisible by 3 or not so input is an integer output should be yes or no okay like coffee cups okay so next division under modulo division next and after that are the numbers are equal you have to give two numbers and those two numbers are equal or not next Celsius to Fahrenheit so next flight luggage weight okay there is small problem is there so they have given the problem you have to find the solution okay savings how you can able to savings there are three friends named Denver Berlin Rio okay who worked at a company so given their monthly salaries and monthly expenditures we have to return highest saving among them they have given their monthly salaries and expenditure consider so Denver salary is nothing but a 10 expenditure is a seven Berlin salary is nothing but seven expenditure is a seven Rio salary is nothing but a 10 expenditure is one Rupee so what is the savings of this person so three three rupees what is the savings of this person zero what is the savings of this person name so we have to return highest savings nine should be the result so we know this logic how to implement this with the help of program this program you have to write I will explain that we have a channel we have a medium is there you have to give your input so already some test cases are given here it will check whether your program is correct or wrong if it is correct it will give one point for this program if it is failed then it is going to display where is the error you have to solo that so by using hacker rank link we are going to discuss this that we will see in our upcoming classes don't worry the people who are willing to continue that I mean interested you can go through that logic based programming Monday class is there at seven o'clock okay we will discuss that so so I think you got a clarity about what is the importance of data structure okay sir I request everyone to please confirm clear up to this so that I will explain the remaining Concepts clear up to this yes sir suppose we want to build our logic so we want to go for the first logic DSA or logic based programmer uh sir if you want to develop logic we need logic based reprogramming okay okay well this course is a duration data structures and algorithms with python course duration is two to three months it is a logical basic problem no that that one that course duration is 45 days maximum one month right sir right so let us go for the remaining topics sir after this backtracking so sorting how you can able to sort the values like how to sort numerical values how to start floating Point values how to sort objects okay what are the different types of sorting algorithms are there like marches art quick sort okay so next and after that uh shells art radixes are the countings are the bubbles or selections are insertions are how we are going to do that under searching linear search binary search how you can able to search it see in python as of now so I am planning to at least 50 applications 50 real-time applications so I am going to cover for searching areas okay that we are planning definitely I will cover in that so next and after that how to divide a big problem into small problems how to solve that problems how to get a solution for original problems like divide and configure strategy also we are going to see next and after that list data structure single link list double linked list circular single linked list circular double English tomorrow I am going to demonstrate any one of the Linker list how we can work with them okay so these things will comes under second part second part of our data structures and the third part stack data structure queue data structure hash table next and after that three priority queues graph data structures these things will comes under Next Level Concepts okay anyway tomorrow also I am going to explain among these one one topic I will demonstrate next dynamic programming 3D method complexities how you can able to calculate complexities under bit manipulations are there okay so binary numbers how to deal with the binary numbers so those things will be covered in this bit manipulations so these are the 23 topics which we are going to cover in this PSA with python okay all these things with executable code I will show you okay already this patch got started sir so we are at very beginning only so for them I explained what is mean by algorithm what is mean by flow chart what are the advantages properties of algorithms so time time complexity space complexity of course not in detail at the top level so what is mean by worst case average case best case and what are the representations of complexities how you can able to calculate by taking one simple algorithms next one after that how to convert a string convert all even indexed values to uppercase odd index values in topper case like some programs I covered for themselves okay even here so how to insert a node at the beginning of the single lingual list inserting a node at ending of the single linger list how to display the single Linker list so like I covers okay so these are things we have seen for already existing patch anyway these things will be covered for you people also don't worry at all okay so this is nothing but already batch got started so I am going to give add-on batch that means so the students who are willing to continue you people are going to combine with that batch from Monday onwards anyway regular syllabus I am going to start from Monday okay so yes with this my demo got completed the people who are willing to continue you can take the screenshot of this and you can get registered now if you are having any queries please let me know so that I will close this session how many days the classes are completed the so far uh for them I think four classes or five classes so those are things also going to be covered yeah yeah definitely definitely sir okay um one or two minutes compulsory okay thanks right any other queries I think no right right okay friends so tomorrow we will meet for the continuation same link you have to use to continue to the tomorrow's class okay right thank you thank you thank you

hello everyone welcome back to the channel for those of you watching me for the first time my name is SAR I've just completed my btech in computer science from it gandh nagar I'm also going to join D show as a software developer in a few weeks on this channel I make videos related to DSA preparation interview preparation for cracking any product based company I also make videos related to btech college life IIT and Engineering for more such informative videos you can subscribe to the channel like the video and share it with all your friends and you can comment down any queries any suggestions which you may have for me I will definitely try to reply to you this video is going to be very very informative as in this video I'm going to tell you the best YouTube playlists that are available for learning DSA some of you guys have commented me that we don't understand Hindi so I have taken you guys into account in this video I'll be telling you the best playlist for learning DSA in both the languages Hindi and English so don't worry after watching this video you will get a Clarity on which channel you should watch which DSA playlist you should should watch whichever DSF playlist I am suggesting please watch only those playlist don't search for different playlist because I have researched a lot and I have come up with the best playlists that are available in the market right now I have seen many people hopping from one playlist to another leading to inconsistency in learning every teacher has a different way of teaching so my advice for you guys would be to stick to one teacher stick to one playlist and learn everything from them that would be much beneficial for you guys instead of just hopping from one playlist to another second playlist to another that won't help you personally I watched only one playlist and that helped me a lot so I would recommend you guys to do that so without any delay let's start the video so the playlists which I would be suggesting to you would be mostly language independent that means that the concept of that DSA topic will be taught to you Pudo code will be provided and once you have these things you know the concept you know the Pudo code it becomes easy to code in any programming language be C++ Java or python if I'm suggesting a playlist which is focused on one particular language then I will tell you don't worry so first we will start from the English DSA playlist so first and foremost I would recommend you stver a toz DSA playlist which has around 300 videos and he has sold more than 450 questions in that playlist I personally have watched a lot of videos from his playlist and the way he teaches the way he explains each and every DSA concept is beautiful and amazing so you can watch his playlist if you like his teaching you can surely stick to this playlist and you will understand every DSA concept well and obviously he's solving more than 450 questions so you will get a lot of practice if you are a beginner at DSA you can watch his playlist if you are at an intermediate level you can watch his playlist if you you know are weak in any DSA concept you can watch that particular DSA concept from this playlist if you just want to study for college examinations this playlist is a good to go and if you want to study for internships or placements at any service based company or product based company this playlist is for you you every DSA concept is covered so no need to worry about that and I would like to mention that this playlist is language independent so he will explain you the DSA concept we will explain you the pseudo code and then you can code it down in any language beat C++ python or Java so sorry to interrupt you guys but apart from DSA some code C subjects are also very important when it comes to coding interviews one such subject is objectoriented programming which is very very important and many questions are asked in the coding interviews that is why I have come up with my own oops course in the language C++ the link is in the description you can check it out already 31 students have enrolled in the course and are enjoying the content you can also be the next one if you want to learn every oop Concept in detail and strengthen your oops knowledge go check out the link in the description and do enroll if you like the content let's get back to the video second English Channel which is again one of my favorite is Abdul Bari s's DS playlist and I used to watch a lot of videos from this playlist when I used to prepare for my college examinations so if you are a person who is weak in a particular DSi concept then you can surely watch videos of this particular playlist because the way he explains each and every concept the way he teaches is quite beautiful so definitely you will love the way he teaches uh if you are a beginner at DSA or are at an intermediate level of DSA and are confused in some DSA Concepts you can definitely watch videos of his playlist but I would not recommend you guys to watch this playlist for internships of a play perspective because there are many topics which he has not covered like link list stack skes and tries so there is a void in this playlist so if you are if you want to prepare for College Mid Sims and end Sims you can rely on this playlist but for internships and placements please don't watch this playlist this is my recommendation so yeah these were the channels which I found are the best when it comes to learning DSA in English there are many channels which you will find on YouTube but those playlists those channels have incom complete DSA so don't watch those whatever I have recommended watch only those and you will thank me later now moving on to the playlists which are in Hindi so the first and foremost recommendation from me would be code helps DSA playlist so the person who is teaching is love buber I'm sure you would have heard his name so this playlist consists of 149 videos love buber has started from the very Basics and has covered mostly all the topics which are required to study for internships and placements at any service based or product based company so whether you are a beginner or at at a intermediate level at DSA whether you want to prepare for college examinations or want to prepare for internships or placements you can watch his playlist but a disclaimer that this course is in language C++ so for all the Java people and python people this course is not for you you cannot watch this the second Hindi playlist which I would recommend is a DS playlist by coder Army so the teacher who is teaching is Rohit n you can search on YouTube and you will get his channel you can search on YouTube coder Army and you will get the channel and you will get the DSA playlist the course is ongoing and I would like to say that the consistency with which he's uploading all the videos is quite remarkable he has started from the very Basics and currently he's teaching graphs so the only topic which are remaining are I guess dynamic programming backtracking and tries I'm sure he will cover those topics and it will complete the whole DSF list by looking at his consistency and the way he's uploading videos every day uh I'm sure he will complete the DSA playlist if you like his way of teaching you can definitely watch this playlist it will definitely help you a lot but again a disclaimer that this playlist is also in C++ so again for all the Java and python people this playlist is not for you sadly and yes if you just want to start DSA or are at intermediate level of DSA or you want to study for call examinations or for internships and placements kod Army DSA playlist is designed for all these so you can watch his playlist now coming to the students who are doing DSA in Java or python so unfortunately for Java people I did not find a DSA playlist which covers all the topics so previous week I made a video listing down the whole DSS syllabus and I was quite disappointed to find that there is no playlist on YouTube in language Java which covers all those DSA topics which are required for internships and placements uh but then also I would suggest you one playlist which you can watch so that is Apna College DSA playlist in Java you can watch that playlist but again many topics like gritty algorithms binary search heaps and dynamic programming are not covered in that playlist which is a major chunk but again for these topics I would recommend that go to Styer playlist because he has covered everything and the course is also language independent so that will help you a lot but the only problem is that the course is in English but you will have to deal with that now for students who are studying DSA in Python again unfortunately I did not find a complete playlist the only recommendation from my side would be to watch the whole Styers playlist but the only problem is that the course is in English but I would say that it is better to watch a playlist in English rather than Hindi because English is something which you should know which is compulsory right because when you will give interviews the communication will be in English when you will do a job the communication will be in English so yeah this was all for this video I hope you enjoyed watching this video and now would have gotten in Clarity on which DS playlist you should be watching I researched a lot for this video and uh after researching for one to two hours I came up with this video and I have provided you with all the best DSA playlists that are available in the market right now for free so now you can learn DSA for free for more such informative videos you can subscribe to the channel that is completely free do that please you can like the video that is also completely free and you can share it with all your friends that is also completely free so please do that please keep supporting and I will always come up with more such informative videos which which will help you in your DSA Journey interview Journey uh placement Journey internship Journey or I can I will also come up with informative videos related to engineering and I that will help you in your btech life or in your engineering life uh so yeah I will meet you in the next video till then keep learning keep growing and stay healthy

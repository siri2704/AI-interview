hello everyone how are you I know you are also fine good and I'm also uh this uh series is not a English reading or English writing or English communication this is a this series is a coding that is a DSA for C++ you know about the C++ is a language is a programming language in uh it industrial DSC is a data structure algorithm for C++ data structure algorithm is a most important part of the any in crack the interview and any examination that is a uh little bit um sure that you know about the code and how to read in proper uh Lang in proper um syntax in proper word okay that is that's why so important for the DSA okay let's start DSA for C++ uh first chapter is a uh flow chart and pseudo code flow chart and Pudo code are different but um I think answer is a similar similar uh flowchart is a chart wise and Pudo code is a sentence wise that's only different about this uh two chapter flow chart is a chart wise and SoDo code is a sentence wise okay now see flow chart flow chart starts from the start obl ex exit then input or output then process then arrows or decision this is a uh start input process and arrows and decisions are step by step process about how to start flowchart you you can look about the side image diagram of a solution I also already say about the flowchart is a chart wise and Soo code is a sentence wise that's why diagram chart wise diagram of a solution starts starts or exit starts or exit we are uh uh this using using this brackets and input and output using this using triangle rectangular brackets uh and process is a normal bra normal uh normal box okay then arrows arrows is you know about the all know about the arrows then decision decision is a Diamond said Diamond said symbol okay is some greater than is equal to zero then one side is a yes or other side is a no okay they can use uh Diamond syntax is only used for greater than less than is equal to okay then is why I am uh underline of the of the word of e because is is the most important word about the diamond said syntax okay then uh you can look carefully about this image about the uh how to start and how [Music] to uh write the flow chart okay then take a screenshot about that I think so you can take a screenshot and we are start next topic about the pseudo code pseudo code okay you look the Pudo code Pudo code is a general Lo logic of a solution um I know you are um um you are a question for what is the general logic of a solution first of all you only send uh only know about the flow chart is a chart wise and sudo code is a sentence wise then sudo code is a general logic of a solution how to um now um we can uh I'm asking ask asking a one question for all of you then you can suddenly not write a qu write answer you can you are think then you are process about the question then you are think then you are write on the book okay that is a general logic of a solution that is most important role play of a pseudo code you can uh build a logic about the this problem then you can uh start the coding okay flowchart uh you know about the start input A and B then sum a plus b then print sum then exit then uh you can look these four stages input A and B sum is equal to a and b print sum and exit Okay this is a pseudo code not is the most difficult about the Pudo code they are similar just uh this is a flowchart in chart wise and Pudo code is a sentence wise like 1 2 3 4 okay that is a different about the pseudo code and flowchart I know actually I am also the face same problem I actually I don't know sudo code or flowchart is the same or not but they are similar but little bit difference that is I'm again and again telling to you flowchart is a chart wise and pseudo Cote is a sentence wise that we are thinking a logic about the how to solve this problem and this is a we can write a sentence but flowchart is also same uh they are step by step process start exit input output name what is the process and what is a greater than less than all about the all information okay this is the most important for the flow chart and pseudo code okay the you can you just think about the most important is pseudo code not a flowchart actually flowchart uh is a a little bit use but pseudo code is use in you every problem because your logic is important for in coding Journey that's why both of you both both of are is very easy just to logically understand about the what is the difference and how to starts end process or most important thing is you uh understand about this symbols diamond symbol TR rectangulars uh normal this is all symbols are using in the starts input process arrows and decisions okay then thank you so much for uh watching thank you so much for watching this video and um uh please like share and subscribe this channel that's why I am also interesting video are uploaded in the YouTube and uh any you can any uh different problem of of any topic you know about the um information about the cing language and uh English any English about related videos we can comment me I'm also trying to my best do I am also trying to my best and I am uh take information and I create a video for uh you okay thank you so much

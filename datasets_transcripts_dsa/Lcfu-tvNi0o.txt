what is a priority queue a priority queue is a type of queue that store the elements based on the priority unlike Q which follows the first in first out principle priority queue follows the priority the element at the top of the priority queue will be the element with the highest priority in a priority queue you can insert elements from one end but you can remove the elements from the top only it means you can always remove the element with the highest priority from the priority queue like in this priority queue suppose we inserted elements in this order 17 22 45 and 8. now irrespective of the order of elements which you inserted in the priority Queue at the top of the priority queue will be the element with the highest priority in that case it's 45 so if someone tries to remove the element from the priority queue it can remove the element from the top only that is 45. now once the 45 is removed from the priority queue the next element with the highest priority will become the top of the priority queue like this so by default priority queue uses Max Heap but if you want you can configure your priority queue to use minhip also

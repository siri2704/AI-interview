welcome to data structures and algorithms for coding interview course I designed this course with ton of content if you want to build your strong understanding in data structures and algorithms this is the perfect course for you now let's see what we will be learning throughout this course we'll start off with runtime analysis first we'll see how to find out complexity of your algorithms we'll talk about Omega notation bigo notation and Theta notation for rest of the course we'll be talking about about Big O notation just for learning purposes we will be talking about Omega notation notation and Theta rotation in this section you will learn how to find it time complexity of an algorithm using sum examples then we will start learning array data structures in the array data structure section we will be talking about 1D array and 2D array how to create array how to use array and we'll be talking about how 1D and 2D array is represented in computer memory then we will talk about linked list data structure in this section of this course we will be talking about four types of linked list singly linked list circular singly linked list W link list and circular W linked list we will implement the four types of linked lists and we will Implement all functionality of linked list for four types of linked list from complete scratch then we will talk about stack we will Implement stack from scratch and we will see how LFO principle works for stack then we will talk about Q data structure we will Implement Q using linked list and array and we will Implement Q from complete scratch and you will see how fifo principle works for Q then we'll start our new data structure tree for tree data structure we have many types of tree but in this course we'll be talking about most commonly used tree data structure first we will see binary tree we'll see how to implement binary tree how to Traverse binary tree we will Traverse a binary tree using bread first traversal BFS and using depth first traversal DFS that means BFS or DFS then we'll talk about binary search and we'll talk about AVL tree we will Implement binary search tree from scratch and we'll Implement all the method of Humanity's history and also will Implement a VL tree from scratch and we will Implement all the functionality for AVL tree data structure from complete scratch then we'll talk about tree data structure for auto search suggestions or for word Corrections we use tried data structure when you type something on Google then Google gives you some suggestions and the suggestions comes from tree data structure then we'll talk about binary Heap we have two types of binary Heap Min Heap and Max Heap we will Implement binary Heap from complete scratch there is a famous algorithm that is called sorting algorithms Heap Sort Heap Sort uses binary Heap data structure and we'll see that also in a sorting algorithm section then we'll learn sorting algorithms you are given an unsorted array you have sort the array into ascending order in this course we'll lean seven sorting algorithms bubble sort selection sort insertion sort quick sort merge sort bucket sort and Heap Sort algorithms after that we will see recursion for tree problem recursion is almost mandatory there are a lot of applications for recursion and that you'll see throughout this course dynamic programming uses recursion for tree problems most of the time we use recursion for graph problem we use recursion and there are a lot of problems problems where we use recursion then we'll talk about dynamic programming using dynamic programming we can transform our exponential time complexity to linear time complexity that we will see in this course we'll see the properties of dynamic programming overlapping sub problems and optimal substructure also we'll see what is the bottom of approach what is top- down approach of dynamic programming then we'll talk about hash table hashing data structure finally we'll talk about graph data structure in this section of this course we'll have a lot of content a lot of algorithms and we'll Implement graph data structure from complete scratch we'll have a complete section for graph in this section of this course we'll talk about some popular algorithms dyra algorithm belman Ford algorithms Floyd wal algorithm primes algorithm trusts algorithm and there are a lot of content we'll have in this section we'll have a complete section for graph data structure if you want to work at a big tech industry like Google Microsoft Amazon Netflix Uber Etc then you have to understand data structures and algorithms deeply for your coding interview after finishing this course you will have a clear understand on this concept data structures and algorithms you will feel confident after finishing this course I use Illustrated video examples and we'll go through line by line of code and we will explain every single details and how the algorithms Works in how the data structures relate to that algorithm if you want to Ace your next coding interview this course will help you a lot if you were a self-taught programmer if you don't have any college degree don't worry enroll this course and start learning data structures and algorithms from scratch

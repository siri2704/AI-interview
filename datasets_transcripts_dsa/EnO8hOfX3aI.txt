despite being from a B Tech in non CS stream with zero coding knowledge yet I cracked Microsoft Adobe and Amazon but it took me 3 years to get it not because of the non CS background or no boot camp but because I wasted a lot of time YouTube tutorials Udi and corsera courses and Di things that does not add any value realizing the mistake now if I go back in time and start coding from scratch I will get the exact same job offer in just 6 months so in this video I will share the road map I would follow to become a proc coder along with it I will share some Insider techniques that I will use to land the high paying job in 2025 in the quickest time frame along with it I will share the resume template which gave me interview opportunities Microsoft Amazon and Adobe so that any Tech aspirent will be in the best possible position to land a high paying job faster in 2025 let me start with my fair IAT J story to getting a higher package than I as soon as I completed my 12th just like many of you I aspired to crack J advance and get into I because my elder brother Manish was studing at IAT at that time but when it comes to J exam not everyone gets lucky to get what they want my J marks were not sufficient to get any desired department or I so I decided to join nit delh that's how I landed in nit Delhi triple Department one good thing about engineering is in first year all departments have the same subject that's when I first learned coding and soon after that I developed a big interest in it but often I had a self-doubt whether I can make a big career in coding from Triple E background then my elder brother Manish who was at that time pursuing B Tech in CS at iatm danbad saw the drive in me and said rajat you know you could totally crack companies like Microsoft and Amazon and I thought he was joking but I took his advice seriously and started working on developing my coding skills from the beginning Manish guided me to focus on building strong foundation so I started learning problem solving system design and CS Basics there were days I felt like I am not getting better there were days I felt like giving up but during these times Manish would sit with me talk with me explain things and keep me going if I look back at myself I understand one thing from my journey you don't need a perfect start or a perfect background you just need the willingness to put the hard work and the drive to keep going now before getting into the road map let's get the foundations right because just knowing and wanting things is not enough we need something more and that brings us to a learner mindset let's get real for a moment when I started I was super scared why because I saw the people who were already from the Cs background were so ahead of me I felt like I could never catch up but keeping the self-doubt aside I believed that my hard work will give results one day and it did that's when I realized hard work beats Talent every single time but we need to be humble to accept that we will make mistakes we also need to understand that our Learning Journey won't be linear this I would call as learner mindset now once you have a learner mindset we then need to have a programmer's mindset trust me it took me 12 months to realize these three simple things first is never give up attitude beginning of the coding Journey will be hard so we must be resilient and keep going second along with teex stxs we have to become good Problem Solver third do smart work along with hard work because hard work is useless if the hard work is not done in the right direction and Dex work makes a good programmer once you have a learner mindset and programmer mindset congratulations you have 50% achieved your goal now let's move on to the Rogue M also in the later part of the video I will share the technique to land a high paying job faster in 2025 and my resume template that got me interview calls from Microsoft Adobe and Amazon so let's start with part one how to become a pro coding fast step one learn a programming language now which programming language to learn in 2025 just like how we talk with our friends using a language which may be English or Hindi programming language is a language we use to communicate with a computer I personally learned Java because I wanted to do app development and app development is done best in Java however I would recommend you can choose any language out of C++ Java or python step two learn objectoriented programming knowing how to code and writing good codes are two different things objectoriented programming is all about writing good quality code both Java and C++ are objectoriented languages so without learning oops Concepts you will always struggle understanding other people's scod and also oops principles are asked in interviews and it teaches you the most important skill of writing good quality clean code so learn oops after learning the programming language step three Master data structures and algorithms DSA is the Cornerstone of any successful software Engineers Journey especially for those aiming for high paying roles a strong grasp of DSA is crucial for efficient problem solving writing lean and optimized code and preparing for technical interviews so how to learn efficiently many aspiring developers make the critical mistakes of diving head first into specific DSA topics without a solid foundations this can lead to one shallow understanding where you may end up memorizing implementations without truly grasping the underlying principles of when and why to use a particular data structure second missed opport opportunities you might not fully appreciate the significance and unique advantage of each data structure this hinders your ability to choose the most appropriate solution for a given problem the recommended approach is build a strong foundations start with foundational computer science concept the MIT open course Weare lectures provides an excellent starting point gradual learning begin with fundamental data structures like Aras and stack gradually progressing to more complex ones like trees cfts and hay these are some of the key courses to master DSC introduction to algorithm MIT open course Weare data structures and algorithm specialization from course era algorithms part one and part two from cour step four solve problems and not just one a lot of them becoming pro at coding will never get completed without solving problems solving problems is non-negotiable start with Le code topic-wise problems then gradually move to company specific problem you don't need to solve 500 questions solve 200 but do them properly understand the logic behind every solution step five projects in resume the recruiters will actively look for internships or projects as it gives validation that you can solve real life problems or showcase specific skills in my case I realized internships are not always an option so I for focused on creating meaningful projects these were not random assignments I made sure they solve real problems or showcase specific skills so how can we build good projects now before explaining how to actually start to apply for jobs and get the job one mistake you should avoid is never Mis practice mock interviews mock interviews are very very important no matter how confident you are never miss it they prepare you for the real deal and they will help you realize how far you have come I used multiple platforms and did mock interviews with friends now for part two how to land a high paying jobs step one the resume you all must have heard of the term ATS everywhere when submitting your resume to any company you need to make sure that your resume is ATS friendly once ATS is taken care of then tailor it to the company's requirement in my journey I make sure to revisit my resume and tailor it according to what the company's requirement was now the question is how to tailor to company's requirement focus on these three things first skills mention your technical skills clearly second projects highlight two to three impactful ones always remember quality over quantity third achievements include anything that stanks out like hackathon or certification now the most important step how to get calls for for interviews one mistake I see among experence is they don't apply to enough companies to create more interview call opportunities simple formula is good resume tailor towards the job role plus apply as many places equals to more interview calls now preparing a good resume is hard as there are so much information on internet regarding the resume format work to include and all so I suggest you to look for a mentorship from experienced person I personally used overleaf templates to create a good resume which can stand out step three fail faster I failed so many interviews at the beginning and yeah it sucks but instead of giving up I used those failures to improve I sit down analyze what went wrong and figure out how to fix it slowly but surely I got better failure talk me things much better than success da those lessons are the reasons I was able to crack micro moft Amazon and AD Doby also a little hair that kept me motivated is I often visualize myself achieving my dreams I had literally imagine working into Microsoft's office as an employee I knew it sound super stupid but it worked that mental picture kept me going through all the late night coding sessions and angless debugging the only thing that can help you go on is the ability to think that you can now I have told you a lie that I will give you the complete road map to get a high paying job but there are certain things we need to discuss in detail like how to make a perfect resume the most important leak code problems Etc these topics need separate videos in itself hence I am making it in upcoming videos so subscribe and click the Bell icon so that you are not missing

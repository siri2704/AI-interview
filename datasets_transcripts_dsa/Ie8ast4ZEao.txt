top five data structures from 127 interviews that I gave at number five we have a heap a heap is used when you want to get the maximum or minimum really fast you need a heap to solve problems like topk largest numbers or topk most frequent numbers at number four we have binary tree for binary trees you should know traversals like pre-order and level order traversal binary tree problems are usually solved using recursion at number three we have a hashmap hashmap is used whenever you want to do fast lookups but the fast lookups at the cost of space number two we have Stacks and qes stacks are last in first out whereas Q's are first in first out data structures stacks and qes are used to solve problems like basic calculator and sliding window maximum at the very top we have graphs

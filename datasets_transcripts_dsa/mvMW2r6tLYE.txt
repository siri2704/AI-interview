all right so you guys wanted to know more about programming languages really the foundation of everything Tech that we use you know so today we're going to break down what they are how they work and why there are so many uh you can think of it as kind of your intro to how the digital world functions yeah that's a great way to put it and you sent over a really great set of resources for us to use too we've got what is a programming language which is great for the big picture yeah and then some specific guides on python uh covering like its basic principles and then things like variables data types and operators too we really want to make sure we connect the dots for you you clear understanding of how it all fits together and also explain why python is so popular these days okay awesome so let's Jump Right In we hear programming languages all the time but what actually is one so at their core they're basically tools that let developers like myself give instructions to computers you can kind of think of it as like a shared language you know with vocabulary and grammar that both people and computers can in theory understand the computer does need those instructions translated into machine code which is its native language but uh and just like human languages different programming languages have developed for different reasons and have you know different strengths that's a really good way to explain it so we give these instructions but how does that code actually make the computer do what we want well it usually goes through a few steps so first the programmer writes the code using a specific language yeah and then the code has to get turned into something the computer's CPU can actually read that transformation happens through either compilation or interpretation and finally then the processor actually follows those instructions at the Machine level okay compilation and interpretation those sound like the big differences yeah could you break down how those work uh and maybe even touch on those examples from the what is a programming language doc sure so let's start with interpretation because that's actually how python works and that's a big Focus for us today so when you've got an interpreter and it sees a line of code in a language like python like let's say print hello world it'll read that one line translate it either into like an intermediate form or directly into machine code and then run it right away line by line so it happens as the program's running it's translated and run on the Fly and this makes it really easy to debug which is why interpreted languages are often used for like rapid prototyping or scripting you know when you need to make quick changes so it's kind of like having a translator reading a speech out loud translating it sentence by sentence as they go along yeah that's a really good analogy now compilation that's different that's how languages like C work and we have that example in the sources you send so in compiled language you've got this program called a compiler and it takes all the code and translates it into machine code before the program ever runs and then that machine code is saved as an executable file and the nice thing is this makes compiled languages really fast so they're good for things that need to be super high performance like operating systems or you know like high frequency trading platforms oh okay so with that c example the hashtag includes studio. H part and the in main part all of that gets converted into one package that the computer can just run directly exactly that c code that you shared is a whole program even though it's simple the compiler takes all of that and makes a single file that can be executed okay I see the difference so in the real world what does it mean for a language to be compiled versus interpreted what are the pros and cons well as we said compiled languages tend to be faster and they performance is more optimized because that translation to machine code happens ahead of time but one of the big downsides is that you have to recompile the whole program every time you make a change even a small one and that can really slow things down when you're developing you know when you're experimenting and making lots of tweaks yeah that does sound kind of annoying if you're constantly updating stuff it can be interpreted languages are better when it comes to debugging and uh crossplatform compatibility because the code is executed one line at a time it's easier to find and fix errors as they happen and if there's an interpreter for a certain operating system the same interpreted code can usually run on different platforms without having to be recompiled for each one the trade-off is that they generally run slower than compiled languages because as we said each line has to be interpreted as its run so it's like speed and upfront compilation versus ease of development and the ability to run on different platforms now the what is a programming language document also mentioned these hybrid languages how do those fit in so hybrid languages try to take the Best of Both Worlds Java is a good example so in Java your code is first compiled into an intermediate format called bite code and this bite code isn't specific to any one processor it's meant to be run by the Java virtual machine jvm which basically acts as an interpreter for the bike code python actually has a hybrid element too it compiles your code into B code and that's then interpreted by the python virtual machine pvm and that bite code step can actually make things run a bit faster interesting so it's not always a clear-cut either situation now looking at this table of popular programming languages it's pretty extensive it seems like there's a language for almost anything you could want to do yeah exactly and this table shows how different languages have evolved to be really good at specific things take python which we'll get into more detail later it's listed as high level and interpreted and it's become hugely important and feels like AI machine learning web development because it's easy to read and has a lot of great libraries then you got JavaScript also high level and interpreted and that's the king of whm development it handles everything from the interactive parts of websites to the backend stuff and then there's Java which like you said is both compiled and interpreted and it's used for a ton of Android apps and big enterprise software C which is procedural and compiled works really close to the hardware so it's great for system level programming and building operating systems looking at this what's a fundamental difference in approach between say Python and C++ that makes them so good at different things that's a really good question so python from the very beginning was all about being easy to read and fast to develop with it's designed to be clear and concise so developers can write code quickly and understand it easily too that makes it perfect for things where speed is key you need to experiment a lot like in data science and scripting C++ M on the other hand is about raw performance and having a lot of control over the systems resources it gives you a lot more control over how memory is managed and how the processor is used that's super important for demanding things like game development and high performance Computing where every millisecond counts but the downside is that C++ code can be a lot harder to write and debug than python code okay so it makes sense why different languages are good at different things it all depends on how they were designed and what trade-offs they made so with all these languages to choose from how do you even know where to start when you have a project in mind yeah that's a big question the very first thing you need to do is figure out what your project actually needs what kind of application are you building how important is performance what platforms does it need to run on for instance if you're making a website that needs to be super interactive in the user's browser you're almost certainly going to need JavaScript if you're working with huge amounts of data and building machine learning models python or R might be your Best Bets because they have those specialized libraries if you're doing a mobile app for Android then just Java or cotlin are good options for iOS you'd use Swift and like we said game development often uses C++ for its performance or C weak ship if you're using the unity game engine so it all comes down to what you're actually trying to build what if you're just getting started with programming the choosing the right programming language section suggested Python and JavaScript why are those good for beginners both Python and JavaScript are good for people who are new to this because they're not as hard to learn as some other Lang languages and there are tons of resources out there for both of them people say python syntax is really readable so it's easier for newbies to understand how code is structured you know that almost reads like plain English and JavaScript is essential for web development and seeing your code actually working in a web browser can be really motivating when you're just starting out plus both languages have really active communities that are happy to help so it's easier to find support when you get stuck that makes a lot of sense readability and being able to see results right away can be really encouraging when you're new to something now we've mentioned python quite a bit actually most of the sources you've been using are about python so let's really dive into it what makes it so special so python is so popular because it has this combination of really great characteristics like we said it's high level interpreted in general purpose and the source Python programming language a complete guide really talks about how simple it is how easy it is to read and just how many different things it can be used for it's not limited to just one area it supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural object-oriented programming oop and even functional programming Styles which means developers have a lot of flexibility in how they build their projects and it seems like it's used for everything from websites to AI to cyber security that versatility must be a big part of why people like it yeah definitely the specific things about python as that Source points out make it really appealing it syntax is simple so it's relatively easy to learn in write code it being interpreted means you can run your code directly without compiling it which speeds up development it's also crossplatform which is huge that means you can write code once and usually run it on Windows Mac OS and Linux without changing much and it's dynamically typed meaning you don't just say what type of data a variable is going to hold which can make code cleaner and faster to write especially for beginners yeah the source said no need to declare a variable types we'll talk about variables soon but that does seem like one less thing to worry about when you're first starting out what about these extensive libraries The Source mentioned that seems like a big plus it's a huge Advantage python has this incredible collection of pre-built modules and libraries that give you all sorts of ready to use functions so for people working in data science and machine learning you have libraries like numpy for number crunching pandas for data analysis map plotti and Seaborn for making visuals and Frameworks like tensorflow and pytorch for deep learning for web development there's D Jango and flask which make it easier to build web applications in cyber security you've got scappy for messing with network packets and requests for interacting with web services and for automating things there's selenium for automating web browsers and pyot GUI for automating graphical user interfaces having this huge ecosystem of libraries means that for a lot of common programming tasks you don't have to reinvent the wheel you can just use existing code that's already been tested and works well wow it sounds like no matter what you're trying to do in the tech world there's a good chance python and its libraries can help you out now let's talk a bit about the basics of python syntax the Python programming language guide uses the classic hello world example which is just print hello world that seems way easier than the C example we saw earlier yeah it shows how python is designed to be readable and concise that print function is built into Python and it's used to display output on the console or other output devices that one line of python code does what takes several lines in a language like C okay so that gives us a Cas of python syntax let's move on to variables the python variables a complete guide explains those so in Python what exactly is a variable you can think of a variable as a name you give to a location in the computer's memory where you store a value that value can be different types of data like numbers text or more complex data structures and one important thing about python variables like your Source says is that you don't have to tell python what type of data it's going to hold when you create it python figures that out out on its own based on the value you assigned to it because it's dynamically typed so if I write X is supposed to be an integer exactly and if later on in your code you do something like X hello python will automatically change the type of x to a string that's pretty cool very flexible now I'm guessing there are rules for what we can name these variables right oh yeah definitely you have to follow these variable naming rules so in Python variable names can have letters uppercase and lowercase numbers Z 9 and underscores but they can't start with a number and you can't use Python keywords which are special words that have specific meanings in the language like if else defa and class and it's really important to remember that python cares about case so myar and myar would be two different variables got it case matters the guide has some good examples of good and bad variable names which is helpful for understanding the rules it also suggests using snake case why is that a good practice snake case is what a lot of python progr rammers do where you write variable names in all lowercase and separate words with underscores so instead of user you do user or total price would become total price this makes your code so much easier to read especially when variable names have multiple words and it makes it easier for you and others to understand what your code is doing makes sense readability is key now the guide also talked about different ways to give variables values giving one value at a time giving multiple values at once and giving the same value to multiple variables at the same time right so the most common way is just to assign one value to one variable like xals 10 or name equals Alice but python also lets you do multiple assignments on one line as long as you have the same number of values and variables Like A B C equals 1 2 3 and if you want to give multiple variables the same value you can just chain them together like x yal 100 that's pretty efficient and it can make your code look a lot cleaner and how do you figure out what type of data a variable is holding in Python for that python has this built-in function called type so if you have a variable let's say xal 10 and you run print Type X python will tell you class int which means X is currently holding an integer this is really helpful in a dynamically Ty language like python where you don't say what type of variable is going to be upfront especially when you're trying to find errors or understand how data is flowing in your program okay so variables are like the containers for your data in Python now let's talk about the types of data you can put in these variables the python data types looks like there are quite few yeah python has a whole set of built-in data types for different kinds of information the python data types complete guide breaks them down well so first you have the numeric types which include integers int for whole numbers like 100 or nav 50 floats float for numbers with decimal points like 3.14159 and complex numbers complex which have a real and an imaginary part like 2 plus 3j one thing that's cool about python integers is that they can be as big as you want so you don't usually have to worry about them overflowing like in some other languages you can think of an integer like counting how many of something you have like how many users there are and you'd use a float when you need more Precision like the average rating for a product so Pon just handles those potentially huge numbers behind the scenes pretty much yeah python manages how memory is used for integers automatically then you have strings Str which are sequences of Unicode characters basically in any kind of text and booleans bull which can only be either true or false booleans are super important for controlling how your code runs with conditional statements right those data types seem pretty standard in most programming languages what about these sequence types mentioned in the guide sequence types are for holding collections of items in a specific order the main ones in Python are lists lists which are ordered mutable meaning you can change what's in them after you create them and can have duplicate elements to tuples tuples which are kind of like lists in that they're ordering can have duplicates but they're immutable you can't change them once they're created and range which is an immutable sequence of numbers that's often used when you want to Loop a certain number of times so lists are your go-to when you need a collection that can change and tupal are for when you have ordered data that shouldn't be modified so lists are flexible and Tes are more fixed got it then there are set types and those are unordered right yeah that's right set types in Python specifically set and Frozen set are collections of unique elements meaning there can't be any duplicates the difference is that a set can be changed so you can add or remove things but a frozen set is immutable since they're unordered you can't rely on things being in particular order sets are really useful for things like getting rid of duplicate entries in a collection or doing math set operations like Union and intersection okay unordered and only unique elements for sets Mak sense for certain things now what about the mapping type the guide mentioned dictionaries so the main mapping type is the dictionary dictionaries are awesome for storing and retrieving data in key value pairs each thing in a dictionary has a unique key and a value that goes with it they were unordered before python 3.7 but now the order of items is guaranteed and you access values using their keys kind of like when you look up a word the key in a dictionary to find its definition the value dictionaries are super versatile for representing data that has some kind of structure that's a good analogy with the real dictionary and then there are binary types and the nontype yep binary types are for working with raw binary data these include bytes which is IM mutable by in Array which is mutable and memory view which lets you look at binary data without copying it you use these when you're dealing with things like files network communication or low-l data stuff the nun type is a special value in Python that means there's no value there it's often used to show that a variable hasn't been given a value yet or that a function doesn't return anything so none basically means there's nothing here okay so none is like a placeholder for missing information now we also talked about how you can convert between these data types using functions like int float and string right python lets you explicitly change values from one data type to another in a lot of cases so you can take a string that's a number like 1 two 3 and turn it into an integer using int 1 two 3 but not all conversions will work or make sense for example if you try to turn the string hello into an integer you'll get an error right you can't magically turn words into numbers okay that was a great overview of python data types so to actually work with these variables in data we need to use operators right the python operators detailed guide looks like it has all the info yeah operators are those special symbols in Python that do stuff to variables and values python has a ton of different types of operators first there are the arithmetic operators which do math these include plus plusus bangs times divide floor divide which gives you the whole number part of it division modulo percent which gives you the remainder of a division and exponent so if you have a 10 and b equal 3 a perspe would be one because that's the remainder when you divide 10 by three right the modul operator is Handy for checking if a number is even or odd for example what's next after the arithmetic operators after that you have the comparison operators which are sometimes called relational operators they compare two values and tell you how they relate and they give you back a Boolean value true or false you have equal to Bay not equal to less than greater than or equal to and less than or equal to these are super important for decision-making in your code because they let you run different blocks of code depending on whether certain conditions are met so those are the basis for Eiffel statements and other conditional logic exactly then you have logical operators and or and not these let you combine or flip Boolean Expressions so for example by five and y10 will only be true if both by five is true and y1 is true but by 15 or y1 will be true if it at least one of those is true and not by five would be false because it flips the result so and means both have to be true or means at least one has to be true and not reverses the truth got it what about bitwise operators those sound a bit more complex yeah bitwise operators are a bit more specialized and they work on the individual bits which are the binary digits of integers they include A and D or x o r not you'd use these when you're working at a very low level with the computer like with embedded systems or network programming or when you need to do very specific spefic things with binary data it's good to know they exist but you don't need to master them right away they're there when you need to manipulate data at the bit level good to know now we also had assignment operators which are more than just the equal sign right the basic one is the equal sign which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left but python has these shortcut assignment operators that combine math with assignment so X plus 5 is the same as X plus 5 you also have math and so on these can make your code shorter and sometimes a tiny bit faster it makes the code less wordy then there are the identity operators is and is not earlier you mentioned they're different from nfal could you explain that again maybe with another example sure so the key thing is that anfel compare the values of two things meaning they check if the content is the same the is and is not operators check if two variables refer to the exact same thing in memory remember our dictionary example imagine you have two physical copies of the exact same digital document if you compare the words on those pages they're identical but there's still two separate pieces of paper the is operator is like asking if you're looking at the same physical piece of paper that analogy makes it much clearer so even if two variables hold the same data is it will only be true if they're basically pointing to the same place in memory exactly finally there are the membership operators in and not in those are for checking if a value is in a sequence like a list or a string right yep so let's say you have a list of fruits called fruits then Apple in fruits would be true if the string apple is in that list and mango not in Fruit would be true if mango isn't in the list they're really useful for seeing if something is part of a collection so very helpful for checking for a specific item within a group now going back to something we touched on before the guide asked is python case sensitive and the answer is yes why is this so important to keep in mind when writing python code it's important because it means python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different things this is true everywhere in your code like in variable name names function names built-in functions like print keywords like if and else and even module and class names if you mess up the capitalization python will think it's something completely different and you'll probably get an error because The Interpreter won't know what you're talking about for example if you name a variable username you can't later use username python will see them as two separate things and the function for printing output is print with a lower case P using print with a capital P won't work this trips up a lot of beginner so paying attention to case is really important for writing python code that actually works okay so it's all about being careful with your spelling and capitalization one capital letter can make a big difference well this has been a really informative Deep dive we've covered so much from the very basics of what a programming language is to the details of Python's syntax variables data types and operators I feel like I have a much better understanding now that's great to hear you now have a good foundation for understanding how programming languages work the key differ between compiled and interpreted languages and a good overview of the core parts of python which is known for being both powerful and userfriendly understanding that variables are containers for data the different types of data python can handle and how to use operators to work with that data those are the basic building blocks for anything else you want to do with programming so what's next what can someone actually do with this knowledge well with all the python libraries we talked about and how it's used in so many different fields Fields like data science AI web development cyber security and automation you can really do a lot with this Foundation now you can start thinking about what kind of problems or applications you're interested in do you want to analyze big data sets Define patterns maybe build interactive websites automate boring tasks to save time or even get into the world of AI python can help you with all of that this deep dive is just the first step in a much bigger journey of learning how to use programming to make your ideas a reality this was a really great overview I hope you all learned something yeah me too until next time see you

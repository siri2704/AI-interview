so data structures and algorithms under ent and e-related subject low yay may be important topics which you have to learn so your conversation with uh discussion before getting started there are different domains and matter okay like front-end development back-end development business development data analyst business analyst associate product manager so it went minimum ctc that you can get through level is six lakhs per annum the intelligence no the tests are hundred percent free okay then coming to the maximum package that you can get through the laundry that is all according to your skill and performance and monitor recently okay low he got a ctc of about 40 lakhs via re-level so the upper bound is in your hands but minimum is what i said you okay description of the interest in the domain went in okay so yeah let's get into the topic so topic choose a dsa under a nt so dsa is a combination of two words ds and a dsnt data structures a ante algorithms okay now coming to algorithms algorithms is to solve a problem there can be multiple ways let's say p and maybe five seconds per attention s3 body may be 0.5 seconds low when a solution change so you put a more it low which is best in terms of time complexity obviously 0.5 seconds low monarchy there can be more than 10 to 15 solutions okay so compare jc output selectors call until it is very very difficult we have something called algorithms under design and analysis of algorithms okay so both are the same so you subject language as the signal without forming several solutions let's say pna problem only separates so we have different approaches algorithms like divide and conquer okay then we have dynamic programming then we have greedy approach then we have backtracking then we have recursion okay so basically these are all different kind of approaches by which you can solve the problem to get the right solution in the first attempt okay so algorithms okay so what are important then dynamic programming finally backtracking backtracking is not very much important but divide and conquer greedy recursion are very much important my dynamic programming and anti let's say me are based on dp okay so dp is also very important okay this is what you have to learn in algorithms excellent data structures called the first starting with normal that is not possible okay arrays will be asked so arrays is the most important data structure most important okay we have linked list link list is also important basically but for example if you're using c plus less than kunta okay we directly have list in stl monkey java monkey continuously okay so use the predefined one when you define json create chain of sunlight okay use the existing ones in the language okay that is the third one now fourth one will be cues and stacks challa important question but naturally it will be helpful okay then but if your target is product based companies then trees is very important and graphs now graphs law we have about okay 10 to 12 basic operations on graphs on basic i mean kind of manipulations on graphs how to store them how to retrieve them how to find the path how to traverse them so then we have different okay 10 to 12 models our 10 to 12 models that is enough so we tend to tell models which is sufficient for any company analytics our 10 to 12 models manage content that is sufficient even in trista water trees we have some i mean okay five to six models trust me okay so practice a lot arrays okay rather practice a lot for linked list okay coming to graphs entries i'll tell you if you want i'll tell you the important models practice change so i hope you all make a dsc dsc dsa on top of the video rds okay thank you very much

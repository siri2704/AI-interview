[Music] hey everyone and welcome to fuzzy programmer I'm your host fuzzy programmer and on this channel we jump into exciting Tech topics together always focusing on that crucial Hands-On coding experience today marks the beginning of something big we're launching a comprehensive news series designed to help you master one of the most vital languages in the tech world today JavaScript now we won't be pulling this out of thin air we'll be using an incredible free and highly respected Resource as our guide the JavaScript algorithms and data structure certification course from free Cod Camp specifically their latest V8 curriculum huge props to the free code Camp team for creating such a valuable learning path that's accessible to everyone we'll be following their structure tackling the concepts lessons and challenges they provide I strongly encourage you to visit their site the link is right down below in the description and maybe even code along there as we go this is a deep dive throughout the series on fuzzy programmer Guided by the free code Camp curriculum we're going to cover the absolute Basics getting started with JavaScript Understanding Variables different data types like strings numbers Boolean and operators core programming Concepts working with arrays and objects controlling the flow of your program using loops and conditional logic IFL statements and writing reusable code with functions modern JavaScript es6 plus will get comfortable with newer syntax like let const Arrow functions classes promises and other features that are essential in today's development World essential tools learning how to use regular Expressions regx to work with text patterns and crucial debugging techniques to find and fix those inevitable bugs data structures understanding how data is organized starting with arrays and objects and touching upon fundamental concepts used in more complex structures algorithmic thinking this is key we'll practice solving problems step-by-step by writing algorithms starting simple and building buing up to more complex challenges programming paradigms getting an introduction to object-oriented programming oop and functional programming FP principles within JavaScript putting it all together we'll cap it off by building the five certification projects required by free code Camp applying everything we've learned in practical ways this series is designed with a wide range of Learners in mind you'll fit right in if you are a complete beginner never coded before no problem we start from zero an aspiring web developer JavaScript is non-negotiable for front-end and increasingly vital for backend work a student looking to supplement your computer science or related coursework making a career change aiming to enter the tech field this is a fantastic starting point someone needing a refresher maybe learned JS a while back and want to get up toate and solidify your foundations especially with algorithms and data structures following the free code cam path if your goal is that specific certification will cover exactly what you need basically if you want a structured Hands-On and supportive way to learn JavaScript from the fundamentals up you come to the right place good news you don't need much a computer any working laptop or desktop Windows Mac OS Linux is fine internet access to watch these videos and access online resources like free code Camp a web browser Chrome Firefox Safari Edge any modern browser Works your time and enthusiasm learning to code takes practice and patience so bring your curiosity that's really it no prior programming experience is required we will teach you everything you need to know right from the beginning of this JavaScript Journey having some html/css knowledge might be useful much later for context in the projects but it's definitely not needed to start learning JS itself here on fuzzy programmer we learn by doing in this series expect videos where I break down Concepts from the free code Camp curriculum into understandable pieces walk through examples step byep code the challenges live explaining my thought process share tips point out common pitfalls and maybe offer alternative Solutions encourage you to pause try things yourself and really engage with the material on the free code cam platform the goal is to make this journey practical less daunting and even fun so are you ready to learn JavaScript boost your problem solving abilities and build some cool things if you are make sure you hit that subscribe button for fuzzy

let me know if you're planning to follow along or what part of JavaScript you're most eager to learn thanks so much for watching this introduction get ready because in our very next video we'll jump straight into the first module learn introductory JavaScript by building a pyramid generator I can't wait to get started with you all see you in the next one

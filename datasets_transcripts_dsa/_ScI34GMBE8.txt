hello all welcome to engineering world so today we are going to discuss important DSA topics that are asked in an interview so these are the 12 important topics which are included in the data structures and algorithms so one who want to become a software engineer they have to know data structures and algorithms the most product based companies will ask data structures and algorithms if you want a high package then you have you must learn data citizen called rhythm so firstly these are the 12 important topics which are very uh most I mean it's mostly included in the data structures and algorithms the first one is arrays Ras is nothing but what it's a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in a continuous and adjacent memory locations it means what it can store a similar data types in a continuous memory location arrays is of two types first one is of int array of tree it means what it is of single dimensional array and second one is multi-dimensional array which is in the form of Matrix so these are the two types of arrays second important topic that is strings in a data structure string is nothing but what it is a sequence of characters so string can be terminated using a null character so this is the second important data structure algorithm topic coming to the recursion recursion is nothing but what the function which calls itself is nothing but a recursion okay so the process of recursion involves solving a problem so by turning it into a smaller varieties of itself varieties of itself it means the recursion in stack in data structures and the functions can be called directly or indirectly so that is recursion so next we have sorting sorting is nothing but what the arrangement of a data in a preferred order is called sorting in data structures so by sorting it is easier to search through it quickly and easily the simplest example of sorting is dictionary okay and the Sorting algorithms are many algorithms we have so first we have insertion and we have bubble SWOT and we also have selection sort so these are this I'm sorting algorithms which are included and coming to the link list so Linker list is also important data structure algorithm it is a most important data structure where it comes to handling the dynamic data elements the Linker list is used to handle a dynamic data elements it means Dynamic elements and so a Linker list contains a data element which contains a node okay and each node contains a two Fields one field has data and in the second field anode has an address that keeps a reference to the next node so it contains a two nodes so firstly the first node contains what the nodes is equals to 2 so the nodes are 2 the first node contains data and second node will contain address so this is nothing but a Linker list coming to the stack what is stack here stack in a data structures is a linear type of data structure that will follow lifo principle stands for last in First Step so this is a principle which is followed by the stack and it allows incision and deletion two operations we can perform here first is insertion and second one is deletion so in the stack data structure coming to the queue Q can be defined as a order list it means which enables insert operations to be performed at one end call rear and delete operations to be performed at another end call frame so there are two terms which we have we are including rear and front Okay and Q is referred to be as first in first term it means it follows a FIFA principle where a stack follows Li for principle and Q follows fifo principle so this is about Q next coming to the binary search the binary search in a data structures and algorithm is very important so this search algorithm will work on the divide and control method so we have divide and conquer method so the data collection should be in the sorted form and binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection so we are going to compare with a mid value so mid value is equals to what here so mid value is equals to start Plus start Plus in divided by 2 so you have to compare the mid value with a search value next we have hashing hashing is a data structure it is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into a small tables using a hashing function and it is also known as message digest function it is a technique that uniquely identifies a specific item from a collection of similar items so in this it contains a hashing function and also we are going to map so mapping can be done so mapping of a large chunk of data into a small tables so there is nothing but hash it SEC and tenth one is graph so graph you already know the graph contains vertices and edges okay so this graph is also very important data structure algorithm and coming to the trees tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize the data in a way that it is used easy to navigate and search so it is going to organize the data okay so it is going to ordinance data and it is a collection of nodes so that are connected by edges and there is a relationship between the nodes so it is a collection of nodes trees is a collection of nodes and also there is a relationship between the nodes so that is nothing but a trees coming to the dynamic programming so dynamic programming is used where where we have problems like which can be divided into similar sub problems okay so that the results can be reused so this is called a dynamic programming it means a problem is divided into a small pads and whatever the results we are getting so that can be reused so that is dynamic programming and mostly this algorithms dynamic programming algorithms are used for optimization purpose and also we are using a in a dynamic way so this is a way we are going to use a dynamic programming it means before solving enhance our problem Dynamic organism will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub problems so we are actually dividing a problem into our sub problems whatever the results we are getting again we are going to reuse that is dynamic program and it is mainly solving for optimization purpose so these are the important data structures or data structures and all written topics so that one who want to become a software engineer they has to know these topics the first one is arrays strings third one is recursion sorting linked list stacked queue binary search hashing graph Trace dynamic programming so I hope you understood this video so thank you for watching my video and we'll meet in the next video with a different topic in an engineering one bye thank you

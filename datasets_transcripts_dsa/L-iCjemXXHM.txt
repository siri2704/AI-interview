so I think we are in recursion recursion so as a part of this recursion we covered these topics like introduction to methods what is the need for methods method calls means what how internally these method calls are going to be maintained what is this stack data structure in method calls so infinite recursion means what finite recursion means what base condition direct recursion indirect recursion and what is a need for recursion properties of recursion steps to implement recursive applications tail recursion non-tail recursion even so we are going to start today applications of the recursion so one by one okay one by one examples I'm going to take as a part of this recursion applications we will see one by one what is this recursions okay so the first application what we have here is sum of natural numbers sum of natural numbers let us see how to calculate this one sum of natural numbers sir what is the problem state M here is suppose if n is equal to 5 we have to calculate sum of natural numbers like 0 plus 1 + 2 + so 3 + 4 + 5 so what is the result that we are going to get 9 10 15 is the output so this one I want to calculate by using recursive approach how to implement we will Implement a program on this let us assume I'm going to take a class called test I'm going to take a class called test so I will save this file with the file name test. Java next inside this sir I will Define a function or method which is going to take public static integer what is the method name that I'm taking is sum and it is receiving one value n what is the formula here is written n + sum of N minus one like this I'm going to take so suppose if I'm calling sum by passing three so what will happen it is going to verify let me write base condition also parall what is the base condition if the value of n is equal to 0 we are going to return zero if the value of n is equal to Z we are written zero so it is going to check is the n value is equal to0 no sir then what will happen sir 3 plus again we are going to calculate sum by passing 3 - 1 which is nothing but two for two what will happen we are going to get 2 + sum of 2 - 1 which is nothing but one for one what will happen 1 plus we are going to get sum of 1 - 1 Z sir whenever we are getting zero it will return zero so 0 + 1 will become 1 1 + 2 will become 3 so 3 + 3 will become 6 like that what is the result that we are going to get six is the output is it correct yes so sum of three natural numbers is nothing but what six only let me print system dot out. print Ln off sum of if you take three the output what we are going to get three 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 which is nothing but six so let us run this program and check whether we are getting the same result or not Java C test. Java Javas space test you can see the output is nothing but what six this is the way how you can able to find sum of N natural numbers by using recursion are you clear with the first application what we have here any doubt friends please confirm hello sir everyone clear with this so what is the next one that we have here is so the next application is I will calculate factorial factorial of the given number so I want to implement a program to find factorial of the given number so same story only right in the place of addition what we have to do multiplication sir if you take any number if I want to calculate 4 factorial how you are going to calculate sir 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 24 have you observed here it is dealing with multiplication so what will be the recursion formula I will take a fact if n is equal to Z I'm going to return one otherwise n into I'm going to take fact of n minus one so how to calculate sir here we are going to take a fact of maybe five so what output we are going to get 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 which is nothing but 120 sir let us run this code and check really is it coming or not yes sir do you want a stack I mean do you want this tree diagram me yes fact iial of something like four I'm taking so is 4 is equal to Z no why because why we are rning one since it is dealing with multiplication so if you are multiplying anything with zero your result will be always zero that's why I'm not multiplying with zero I'm going to return one next sir 4 into again it is going to be calculated for 4 Min - 1 which is nothing but 3 for three again it is going to be calculated so 3 into so for two again it is going to be calculated one so whenever we are getting one 1 into fact of Z for zero which value we are rning We Are rning One not zero so what output we will get here sir it is going to return sir one sir 1 into 1 will become one so 1 into 2 will become 2 so 2 into 3 will become 6 6 into 4 will become 2 before like this we will get sir is it correct yes if you want let us run the code and check sir everyone clear with this factorial program please confirm sir clear with the terminology please confirm yes any doubts right this is nothing nothing but a factorial program what is the next application multiplication of two integer values I want to demonstrate how to multiply two integer values how to multiply two integer values I want to demonstrate so how to multiply very simple sir system. out. println of I'm taking mL of 5A 3 so my expected output is 5 into 3 which is nothing but 15 what is the method name that we are taking mul which is taking two parameters like integer a comma B now what is the code here what is the code here sir there are two parameters are there like five and three okay first I will draw the tree diagram sir then you will get clarity what is a tree diagram for this is Sir multiplication of 5A 3 I will take five plus multiplication of 5 3 - 1 2 that means two times again I want to add five this one 5 plus again multiplication of 5 comma 1 what will happen 5 plus so again it is going to calculate like mul L of 5 comma 0 sir whenever we are getting zero what will happen it is going to return zero sir 0 + a 5 it is going to return 5 5 + 5 it is going to return 10 sir 10 + 5 15 is it correct multiplication of 5 into three is nothing but 15 sir 5 into 3 means we have to add five how many times three times sir is the logic is clear tree diagram is clear for everyone please confirm sir is the tree diagram is clear for everyone yes sir tell me sir how to write code for this written tell me what we have to take tell me the formula H tell me sir from this diagram you can tell the formula right this is the formula this is the formula this is the formula a plus M of a comma B minus one very good A Plus M of a comma B minus one sir what is the base condition base I think it will be if it is b equal to Z return very good B is equal to Z means we have to return zero am I right one second one second please wait B less than or equal to zero e e e e yeah sorry for the delay sir clear up to this sir is it correct B is equal to Z means I'm going to return zero right sir correct only right yes so if you want you can take B less than or equal to zero also no problem why because if any negative number is coming just simply it is going to skip okay you can also take in that style also no issue at all ah sir there is one more trick is there listen carefully tell me answer in this case what is happening how many times recursion call is coming sir one two three times am I right if you take multiplication of 3 comma 5 how many times recursive call will come sir please confirm 3 comma 4 then 3 comma 3 3 comma 2 so 3 comma 1 3 comma 0 five times it is going to come am I right sir correct only right yes but the result of 3 into 5 and 5 into 3 both are same I don't want to take these many calls that's why what I will do is I will write one more more case suppose if the value of a is less than B I'm going to call just by exchanging B comma a anyway a comma b or B comma a both are same right so just to improve okay just to improve the method calls I'm going to use this approach can I use yes friends please confirm can I use this this approach what is Advantage just to improve the number of method calls I'm going to use this technique guys please respond can I use like this everyone understood yes sir we can use but the logic is not correct right to mod why sir which one just now I explained 3A 5 do you have doubt in this or 5 comma 3 no no no the 3A 5 was about to say okay I will I will I yeah yeah I will draw the tree diagram you will get clarity we are calling 3 comma 5 right so is B is equal to Z no a is less than b yes then I'm going to call M of 5A 3 then again it is going to call here is B is equal to Z no is a is less than b no then regular 5 + m l off so 5 comma 2 are you getting the point understood yes just only this interchanging of these two variables is happen why we are doing this activity because I don't want to make more number of iterations when more number of iterations will come if B value is very high then more number of iterations assume sir 2 into 100 I want to take how many iterations it will take 100 am I right if you interchange 100 comma 2 how many iterations it is going to take only two I mean method calls which is best definitely second one understood sir but one sir here we do multip this problem directly we can WR into three statement this problem statement yes we can we can but just I'm trying to explain how recur is going to work okay even in the previous program also if you have n we have a direct formula n into n minus 1 by 2 just I explained how the scenario is happening from low level to high level we have to see all the cases somewhere this logic is going to be helpful in future if you understand this LEL program then you will immediately get the idea but we won't use this in the real time okay understood yes sir this is nothing but how multiplication of two integers are going to work let's run 15 so next one fibon sequence fibon sequence I want to generate fibon sequence sir what is a fibon sequence sir tell me what is the first digit first number in the fibon sequence Z am I right what is the next number one what is the next number one what is the next number two sir is it sum of sum of two digits or not yes yes sir tell me locations is it z z element it is the first element second element third fourth fifth 6th 7th eth and so on am I right sir yeah we can't generate this sequence but if you give n value it will find out that fibon number okay suppose if I'm giving n is equal to 6 what is the sixth fibon number 8 that we can calculate so recursion is the best approach because common factor is there right so I will write a function like Fib how many inputs you have to take only one let us assume that input is n i will write code don't worry if I'm calling FIB of if I'm calling FIB of 6 tell me sir what is the output that we are going to get yes tell me what is the output that you are going to get please confirm e e e sir clear everyone please confirm what is output that you are going to get for six what is output sir e position 8 is the value that we are expecting sir how to do that tell me first base condition no I want to write the recursion logic sir what is the formula if you are giving n value is it sum of previous two numbers am I right is it a sum of its previous two numbers am I right yes tell me sir return FIB of n-1 plus FIB of nus 2 am I right yeah H sir when we have to stop if n is equal to Z we have to stop am I right sir yes or if n is equal to 1 also we have to stop because for both we can return return n am I right if you see if n is equal to 0 0 if n is equal to 1 1 understood clear sir so if n is equal to Z zero fibon number is zero first fibon number is one but from second onwards it will change it is depending on this formula but these two same right boss please confirm yeah listen clear so everyone understood this logic so I will draw tree diagram for this I don't want this much big tree for example consider I want to calculate fibon of forer what is a fibon of four is it three or not fibon of four the expected output is three let me check sir FIB of four is n is equal to zero no sir is n is equal to 1 no sir then so two method calls will be there one is f of 4 minus 1 which is nothing but 3 F of 4 minus 2 which is nothing but 2 then F of three again two times why because until getting either zero or 1 it will expand F of 3 - 1 2 so F of 3 - 2 which is nothing but one and this one F of 2 - 1 1 F of 2 - 2 0 then this one again 2 - 1 1 so 2 - 2 0 like this we are getting uh now check sir F of one means which value it will return H which value it will return one one sir which value it will return z z so 1 + z which value it will written one F of one which value it will return return one 1 + one which value it is going to return two s f of one which value it will return return one F of0 which value it will return 0 0 + 1 which value it will return 1 1 + 2 which value it is going to return three sir is the tree diagram is clear sir everyone clear with this logic how this tree diagram is built clear C understood sir clear everyone please confirm right so let us execute for this fi B of six whether we are getting eight or not we have to cross check so the output what we are getting is eight sir clear is it coming so if you want to store this value we can take aray list and we can push all these elements by writing a loop and we can print that is our choice sir clear everyone please confirm sir how to generate fibon sequence clear yes right next the next one is Sir triono sequence what is a tribon sequence how you can able to generate the values in the tribon sir tribon means it is a continuation it is a sum of last three digits last three digits sum you have to take sir first digit in the triono is zero second number is one third number is two sum of these three numbers is nothing but next number tell me what is the next number H what is the next number three next three numbers dig some what is the next three numbers six next 9 + 2 11 11 next 20 20 like this we have to generate sir zero triono number first second so third fourth fifth am iate tell me what is a Formula can I take in the place of FIB I'm going to take Tri what modification you need to take sir Tri of n minus1 nus 2 plus trib of n minus 3 am I right sir yeah when n is equal to Z 0 when n is equal to 1 1 n is equal to 2 2 so we can take one more condition like if n is equal to 2 return two that's all so what is the sixth triono number 20 let me execute and check whether 20 is coming or not perfect so everyone clear how it is going to come if you want I will draw the tree diagram have a look once so I'm taking so triono of some five how many method calls will be there three method calls why because three internal method calls are there one is trib of 5 - 1 4 so 5 - 2 3 so 5 minus U 3 is nothing but two and this one again three times this one again three times this one again three times I think this one won't execute three times because it will return directly two and this one 3 - 1 which will become two so 3 - 2 which will become 1 3 - 3 which will become Z it will return zero it will return 1 it will return 2 2 + 1 + 0 it will return two what about this one so T of 3 so T of 2 T of 1 so it will return one it will return two so it is going to be expanded one more time so T of 3 minus 1 which is nothing but two and this one is one this one is zero it will return zero it will return one it will return return two so 2 + 1 3 + 0 3 it is going to return so 3 + 2 5 it is going to 3 + 2 5 + 1 6 is going to return 6 + 2 + 2 6 7 8 9 9 is the result am I right so something is wrong here have a look once where the problem is coming 5 - 1 5 - 2 5 - 3 so two and here three means uh 2 1 0 which is nothing but two here it is rning two sorry here it is not three it is rning two 2 + 2 4 + 1 5 5 + 2 7 8 9 9 t of 5 is 9 am I right no still it is not coming so what is a problem where we did a mistake can you please cross check here it is three only and here it is to one 3 + 2 5 + 1 6 only I think here up to this correct then here 2 + 1 3 +0 so it should return three and here two 6 + 3 9 10 11 so now it is coming clear sir everyone so it is same like fibon the only difference is nothing but what fibon is a sum of previous two digits tonoi is a sum of previous three digits except that remaining things are same are you clear with this terminology friends please confirm clear so that's all sir this is nothing but all the demos from Monday we will have our regular classes and again I'm repeating so what is the timings of this session 6: p.m. from Monday you have to join at 6 p.m. 6: to 7:00 session will be there from Monday onwards the people who are willing to continue you can start making payments by today and tomorrow okay so 2,500 is the fee if you are having any queries please let me know otherwise you can leave any doubts right sir then thank you we will meet on the continuation on Monday this is 7:00 B right no sir only demos at 7:00 I told already in the beginnings already 6:00 batch is there just we planned another backup batch for this only demos at 7:00 regular timing is 6 to 7 from Monday you have to join at 6:00 right sir thank you

hello guys welcome back to this channel hope everyone is fine on that note let's start this video guys for the past 5 years we have been providing solutions for various nptl courses including this one as well so this is week five programming assignment as well guys so we have Prov uh provided 100% correct Pro code here so please look at that code very carefully guys so even one character if you miss it will lead to the error so please follow the exact indentation so the question is write a Python program to read the data as described above and print out a line listing the grade point average GPA for each student in the following format so it should print role number next full name and GPA grade point average so this should be if this is the sample input then this should be the sample output so I will show you the code in two parts guys so clearly note it down so this is the first part of the code so I'm copying this so clearly see the indentation guys very very important so I will copy this and paste it here you can if you want you can take a screenshot of this or you can pause the video here and clearly note each and every character guys including the spaces as well now I will paste it here so let me Zoom this for you so the first one is import statement so here you can see this is the first part of the code guys please watch the video till the end because if you make any if you want if you skip the video you may miss some changes if I do any so do watch full video guys so this is the code of first part code guys so hope you have noted down or you can take a screenshot now click on enter and I'm erasing this hope you have noted it down guys please follow the indentation for if if statements and all for the for loop as well for loop as well right so now so place the cursor at the start of the line guys cursor should be at the start of starting of the line it should be parallel to the import statement now let's see the remaining part of the code so this is the first part rate so straight down this import statement you have to paste this one I mean uh this is for calculation of GPA and print the printing the values so so just keep the cursor beside exact to the import statement so the result from here onwards so this block should be in the line of import statement so don't type it from the middle or something guys so this should be the exact program so take a screenshot of this so these are the two parts you have to type here many students are uh some students are asking for asking to give the code in the text format guys so that they can simply copy that so Our intention is to make a video so that you can get some clarity and you can you can get practice of typing as well by seeing the code and you can get to know every syntax as well if we do like this if I give that in the text format you can simply copy and paste the code and you not you not be able to get habituated to type the code in future so practice from now itself so that you can get to know syntax as well so how the syntax will be how if you make a mistake then you can compare with our code how this works so what happened where we got wrong so you can get to know all of this so that's why we are not providing the code guys so please cooperate with us this is simple code you can easily see this you can see and type the code simple for Loop and if condition and else condition simple if else block right that's it guys so this is the first part so straight below the import statement there should be the code right second block of the code so I'm clicking on compile and run button already I have take uh click on the submit Button as well now let's see so here you can see compilation passed 2 by two test cases also passed the status is also showing passed After ignoring presentation error so it's not an error it's just extra sln at the end so due to that it is showing presentation error but here it is showing past so our solution is 100% past and second one as well passed After ignoring presentation error so our solution is correct now let's click on the submit button for checking private test cases now let's see what happened so here you can see all the six private test cases are also passed as well right so our solution is 100% correct so that's it guys for this video so keep supporting us like this forever guys so until the next video goodbye thank you

so let's just see how we can delete the last node of a w link list so here we have our W link list with the node 100 200 and 300 so let's now see how we can delete the last node of the W link list so here we have the W link list with three nodes 100 200 and 300 so here we're going to write the function to delete the last node of the doubly linked list so the function will return struct node type pointer and we're going to call the function delete last node now the function will take struct node type pointer head now inside the function first of all we have to check if the list is empty or not if the list is empty that means there are no other nodes then this head pointer will point to null so here we can check that if the head is pointing to null that means the list is empty so in that case we don't have to perform the deletion we can print list is empty and then we can just simply return null so that is the first case so now we have to check if the list has only one note now suppose the list has only one noes so that means the head nodes next pointer and previous pointer will point to null so here we can check that if the head nodes next pointer is pointing to null so that means there is only one note so in that case we can just free the memory and then we can return null so here we're going to free the memory that is allocated by the head node and we can return null now in the third case suppose we have multiple nodes and we need to delete the last node so in that case we need one temporary pointer which will initially point to the head and then we have to Traverse the list and we have to reach to the last Noe so here we're going to create the struct Noe type pointer temp which will in point to the Head node so now we have to Travers to the last node so we're going to use the while loop so while the temporary pointers next node is not equal null so as long as the temporary pointers next node is not null we're going to continue this Loop and we're going to shift the temporary pointer to the next note so this temporary pointer will initially point to this head in every iteration of the loop this pointer will be shifted to the next node until it reaches to the last node so when it reaches the last node then we have to perform the deletion so before deleting this node we have to set null to the next pointer of this previous node so here we're going to do that so temporary pointers previous nodes next pointer should point to null so temporary pointers previous nodes next pointer we are setting null and now we can free the memory allocated by this last node so here we can free the memory that is allocated by the last node which is pointed by this temporary pointer so that means we have successfully deleted the last node of the linked list and now we can return the new head after the deletion so you can see currently we have three nodes in the linked list now we can delete the last node so here we can call delete last node and we're going to pass the head pointer now this function will delete the last node and it will return the new head pointer so let's now print the list again so you can see initially we had three nodes after the deletion of the last note you can see we're left with two nodes so the last note 300 is removed from the W link list so this is the way we can delete the last note from the W link list so hope you understand the concept see you in the next one take care [Music]

so hi everyone so in this video we will discuss about the most important topics for gate csse so I have analyzed last 15 to 20 years of gate csse papers and I came up with a list of important topics for gate csse so from each subjects I will let you know about the important topics and some easy and scoring topics as well so if you are planning to leave any subjects don't leave it completely you can consider uh studying these easy and scoring subjects also like if you think you should uh leave some subject or some topics I have analyzed all the previous 15 to 20 years of gate CSC papers so I will let you know about the weightage of each topic and each subject so you can plan accordingly what subjects you can leave so after watching this video you can decide by yourself uh which subjects you should leave and which subject you can still cover in this remaining time okay so let's get started with the video okay so let's see the subject-wise analysis for each subject of gate csse so before that I've have done like last 15 years of analysis so I've taken the data from this website gate overflow so I have seen the maximum minimum and the average marks that came from each subjects and each Topic in gate csse and you can also check out uh the marks distribution here so first I have the marks distribution for different subjects in 2024 similarly for 2023 2022 and 2021 if you can see carefully so the subjects like this operating system so in 2024 operating system was of 10 marks uh in 2023 uh it carries total nine marks of weightage in 2022 10 marks and in 2021 you can see it's 7even marks and similarly for these subjects like uh computer networks and discrete mathematics you can see a lot of weightage they carry okay so there is a tradeoff so if you try to cover these subjects like operating system computer network and discrete mathematics so they will take a lot of time to cover okay but the weightage is also very high but if you see these subjects like compiler design and digital so these subjects are easy to cover and you will take less time to cover these uh subjects but this wait AG is also less so you can decide accordingly so which subjects you can cover and which subjects you can not I I will tell you about the easy and important topics from each subjects and also let you know about the weightage so first let's see about the programming and data structure so this is the marks distribution for programming this is only for C programming and not for data structure for data structures I have it in the next slide so this is the marks distribution for dat data structures so this is from uh 2010 to 2024 okay so you can see uh the minimum maximum and the average marks of last 15 years from programming and data structures so the maximum marks from programming is of 10 marks and from data structure 7 Marks here you can see uh in some year like if I remember correctly from in uh uh 2014 in some set there is no question from programming so that's why the minimum uh here is zero marks so if I talk about the average marks so average marks is four to six marks each year from programming and similarly for data structure four to five marks okay let's see the important topics from programming and data structures so the first one is stacks and cues so you can see uh this is the number number of question that came till now in the gate exam from this topic stacks and cues so if I have to say uh the stacks and cues is very easy topics and the question that came in this gate exam from St and qes are also very easy so this is uh very easy and scoring topics that you should cover and the next we have is binary trees and binary search Tre so here you can see 87 question came from this topic so this is a huge number okay 87 questions came from this binary trees and binary s trees so this is very very important topics so you must cover this topics um if I have to tell you like all these topics from programming and data structure that I have listed here is very very easy from the other subjects I will let you know about the important and the easy ones also but from this all the topics I can see here are easy only the next is heaps so from heaps 29 questions came till now so heaps is also very important topic so from heaps the questions from like Min Heap Max Heap uh will come and the next one is the link list so this is also an important topic so the next is hashing so this is somewhat tricky topic this is not that much easy or I can say this is not a easy topic this is something tricky uh but yeah in the previous year some easy question also came from hashing but some tricky questions are also there okay the next I have is array so arrays is also very important topic so from array till now only 13 question came uh but these are dedicatedly uh of arrays but if you can see uh there are a lot of questions where this Concepts will be useful so uh you should not consider this 13 only so uh in total there will be a lot of question from arrays so you must study this topic okay so the next is algorithms so this is a marks distribution for algorithms if we can see the minimum uh average and the maximum marks so each year the average is 9 to 10 marks okay so algorithms carries a lot of weightage okay or you can see in some year like 15 marks uh from algorithms are there let's see the important topics of algorithms so the first one is asymptotic notation so asymptotic notations like B Omega Theta you have to study about these asymptotic notations and then uh you should solve the questions on these asymptotic notations so in total there are 21 questions from the last years in from this asymptotic notations so the next we have is Graph Search so Graph Search is also an important asymptotic notation is also important so all these topics that I have listed are important but I'm telling you about the some easy uh topics also so this graph search basically carries this uh DFS DFS these things okay so the next is minimum spanning trees so from minimum spanning trees you can see till now 33 question games so this will have like algorithms like prims algorithms cral algorithm okay so these will be covered in the minimum spanning trees so the next we have is recurrence relation so this is something easy that you can cover so the next is sorting so you have to study about the Sorting algorithms like uh quick sort much sort Etc okay so this is also easy and scoring topics some tricky question also came from this topic in the previous years but yeah mostly easy question will came from this topic the next is time complexity so from time complexity the question like a program will be given to you and they will ask you for the time complexity of the programs and they can also ask you for time complexity of some algorithms also okay so next we have digital logic so this is a Marx distribution for digital logic so you can see on an average on an average each year five to six marks are there from digital logic okay so these are the important topics from digital logic that I have so the first one is Boolean algebra so this is really very very very easy topic to cover and this will not take you more than 1 to two days to cover so you have to study about some uh truth tables and some Boolean variables Etc so you can cover this very easily in one or two days and the question from Boolean algebra are also very easy so you must cover this topic okay bullan algebra the next is circuit outputs so here we have two things like combinational circuits and sequential circuits so the sequential circuit part is somewhat tricky tricky or you can say people find this thing hard but uh this combinational circuit is comparatively easier than this sequential circuit so if you cover these combinational and sequential circuit so there are some circuits will be given to you and they will ask you what will be the output function for for this combinational circuit or they can ask you what will be uh the flipflop is doing what sequence this flip-flop is generating and all so these were some question that came from this uh circuit output so it carries a lot of vage you can see 39 question came in the previous years so the next we have is number systems you can see 57 question came from this number system or you can say number representation so this is also very very important topic so here you have to study the topics like uh one's complement two's complement uh decimal number binary numbers and uh uh like floating Point representation Etc okay next I have is operating system so you can see this marks distribution for this operating system so this is the minimum maximum and average marks of last 15 years for operating system so on an average every year 8 to n marks are there from operating system maximum you can see there were 12 marks from operating system so these are the important topics from operating system you can see from process scheduling total 47 questions came in the previous years so in process scheduling so this is also very easy and scoring topic that you can study so in process scheduling you have to study some algorithms like fcfs sgf lrf Etc so the question uh from process scheduling that K are very very easy so you you must study this topic and don't leave operating system completely if you are planning to leave this completely don't leave it completely at least study this topic process scheduling the next is Page replacement so here also you will have some algorithms like uh least recently used first in first out uh first in first out Etc So based on that uh there will be some questions so from this also like 32 question cames which is a huge number so the next is syn synchronization from synchronization you can see 52 question came till now so but this part is somewhat tricky and you can say hard okay so this is not easy to understand topic you have to spend a lot of time to understand this topic clearly so the next is like disk so in disk uh we will have questions like some number of tracks will be given to you number of sectors will be given to you they will ask you what is the size of the memory or they can ask you the seek time Etc okay so this is I can say easy to moderate easy to moderate so so the next is resource allocation so from resource allocation there were 27 questions till now so in resource allocation the questions uh you can say are easy only but uh like once you have to understand the concept of Deadlock and all then you can very easily solve these question from resource allocation so the questions are like uh some processes are given to you and each processes requires these many instance of a resource then how many minimum number of resources you need to avoid deadlock so these are the type of question that came from this resource allocation so the next is virtual memory so this is also you can say something tricky so you have to spend some time to understand this topic well virtual memory but after that you will be able to uh solve the questions from this virtual memory and this is also an important topic for operating system a lot of question came from virtual memory till now also uh apart from this tricky questions there are some easy questions also like uh if you have seen some size of memory will be given to you and then uh the size of page will be given to you they will ask you for the number of tag bits and all okay so if you uh once you understood this concept then you will be able to uh Tagle some easy question from this topics virtual memory so the next is theory of computation so this is the marks distribution for to so you can see this is the average minimum and maximum marks for to so on an average 7 to eight marks come from to every year also uh in some year like there were 12 marks from to so these are some important topics from to the first is regular language and regular expression so this is the easiest topic from to okay you can see 62 question came only from regular languages and regular Expressions the next is finite automa from here also 41 question came so uh this you can say is easy to moderate because some question uh from finite automa are tricky the next is uh CFL that is context free language the next is decidability this is again something tricky okay so you have to understood this uh concept decidability very well to answer all the questions from decidability so the next is compiler design so this is the Marx distribution for compiler design so in 2024 you can see nine marks are there from this compiler design also like for the years like 2024 where there are two sets like set one and set two so I have taken the average of these two sets Okay average marks of these two sets I have written here like nine nine is the average of both the sets so this is the minimum maximum and average marks of compiler design so you can see uh on an average five five marks are there from compiler design every year okay so these are some important topics from compiler design the first one is grammar so you have to study about these grammars and all like some grammar will be given to you they can ask you for the uh first and follow of the symbol some symbols so this is also very easy topic that you can study and answer the questions from this topic the next is parsing so parsing is somewhat tricky okay so this is some tricky topic the next is syntax directed translation so this is also an easy and scoring topic so you can study about the syntax directed translation okay the next is computer organization and architecture so this is the marks distribution for COA so you can see on an average 6 to seven marks are there from COA every year also maximum you can see 11 marks are there from COA okay so these are the important topics from COA so the first is addressing mode so this is easy topic that you can study so you have to study about the addressing mode such as like direct mode indirect mode Etc the next is Cash memory so you can see cash memory is very very important till now 71 questions are there from cash memory so you can see how important it is but for this uh you have to spend some time to understand it well like uh there are a lot of uh concept that you have to study in this cash memory so there will be questions uh like uh the total memory exess time questions about tag bits or something like that the next is pipelining so this pipeline also you can say easy to moderate topic this is uh there are some easy questions also but there are uh some tricky questions also from pipelining in the previous years so this hazards also come under this pipelining only so this is also some easy topic that you can study one time and answer the question that has been asked the next is computer networks so this is the marks distribution for computer networks so you can see uh on an average like 7 to eight marks are there from computer networks every year so these are the important topics from computer networks the first one is IP addressing and subnetting so most of the question came from here only like IP addressing and subnetting so you have to understood this well IP addressing and about this subnetting supernetting is not very important but like the most of the question came from subnetting only so this is the important topic and this is easy also once you understood this then you will be able to answer most of the questions the next is application layer protocols so you have to study about like very basic things about the prot protocol like what these protocol does http what does http does what does DNS does what is SMTP and all so this is also easy topics and straightforward uh questions came from these application layer protocols next is error detection from here like 10 question came in the last years so 10 question came in the previous years so this is from here some topics like CRC and all these are some tricky topics I can say the next is routing algorithms distance Vector routing link state routing and all so from here 21 question came till now the next is sliding window protocol from sliding window protocol there were 21 question till now so you have to study about like uh flow control policies and about the flow control to answer the questions from sliding window protocol so this is also I can say easy and scoring topic that you can study from CN sliding window protocols the next is TCP so in TCP you have congestion control and all congestion control okay so for TCP also you have to spend some time to understood it well and answer all the questions the next is dbms so this is the Marx distribution for dbms these are are the minimum maximum and average marks of last 15 years for dbms so you can see on an average 6 to seven marks are there every year from dbms so these are the important topics from dbms first one is normalization so some question that came from normalization were easy but some of them were tricky also so the next is SQL queries you can see there are 55 question in the previous years from SQL queries so this is very very important topics and also easy so it might take only uh one or 2 days I think to cover all the SQL and then you will be able to answer all the questions from SQL the next is relational algebra okay from this topics also uh some very easy question came but uh at the same time some very tricky question were also there from this relational algebra the next is B Tre so this is also very important topic and uh from this 29 questions are there till now the next is transaction and concurrency control so from transaction and concurrency control there were 28 questions till now the next is discrete mathematics so this is the marks distribution for discrete mathematics you can see on an average each year 9 to 10 marks are there from discret mathematics in 2022 you can see the maximum marks that are 13 marks are there from discrete mathematics so so so these are the important topics of discrete mathematics so the first one is propositional logic so I can't specifically list out the topics from discrete mathematics here because all these topics are important and from each of these topics a lot of question came in the previous year so all these topics are important only like propositional logic first oral logic combinatoric set theory graph Theory group Theory graph theory is the most important topic so a lot of question came from graph Theory so from this I can say this is the easy topic that you can cover okay set theory is again an easy topic that you can cover okay and this relations and function is also very SC easy and scoring topic from discrete mathematics but all these topics are really very important from discrete mathematics the next is engineering mathematics so this is the Marx distribution for engineering Ma mathematics so these are the average minimum and maximum marks for engineering mathematics you can see each year there are 7 to eight marks from discret uh engineering mathematics okay so the important topics from engineering mathematics are obviously like linear algebra calculus and probabilities so only these three topics are there mainly in engineering mathematics so from linear algebra you can say ion values and system of equations are the important topics so there were a lot of questions from this igen values topics so they are asking for the igen values of some Matrix or for rank of some metrics and all also there are lot of question from this system of equations so from probability there are mostly there are question from base theorem and conditional probability and similarly from calculus you can study these maximum minimum limits and continuity okay so coming to aptitude so aptitude each year 15 marks are there from aptitude like fixed these 15 marks are fixed from aptitude so for aptitude I don't have any important topics to share but do solve at least last 15E pyqs of all the branches across all the branches like CSC EC civil Etc so solve pyqs of all these branches okay and only this is sufficient if you solve all the pyqs of all the branches then this is more than sufficient you don't have to practice anything else for aptitude or you don't have to study anything else apart from this for aptitude okay so yeah that was it for this video so if you have any doubt related to the G preparation you can just drop a comment so I will try to answer them so yeah thank you everyone

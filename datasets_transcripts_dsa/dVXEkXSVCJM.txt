yeah so good morning everyone welcome to Durga soft online training okay good morning good morning to everyone welcome to Durga soft online training online training and welcome to data structures and algorithms online batch okay welcome to data structures data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms with which language python python okay we can Implement these data structures by using any programming language we can Implement data structures with the c we can implement the data structures with the c plus we can Implement data structures with Java JavaScript python any programming language we can take for implementing this data structure but here in this course we are going to see the implementation of these data structures by using python python so myself K prakash Babu having 15 years of experience as a trainer 15 years of experience as a trainer okay and coming to this course this course you know very well TSA data structures data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms with python python so Desa with the python okay dsk with python and the timings of this particular session sir it is not from seven o'clock okay it is not from seven o'clock the course is going to start at 80 am so 8 p a m to 9 00 am 8 AM to 9 A.M Monday to Friday okay this is Adam better already one batch is running at eight o'clock we stopped that batch for a few days and we are going to combine this batch with that eight o'clock batch okay so the regular classes are going to be start from so maybe this weekend Thursday or Friday we are going to start officially so till that demo sessions will be there so you need to attend these classes this complete week you need to attend from 7 AM to 8 am from the next week onwards that is coming Monday are words so the timings of this batch will be from 8 AM to 90 okay 8 am 29a please make sure that okay yeah no problem you can watch recordings also recording Support also will be there and duration of this course duration of this course is so two months two months duration of this course is nothing but two months May June Max by June ending we are going to finish okay tentatively five to six days before or after we will come and coming to fees for this batch is so you need to pay rupees triple nine is nothing but the fees for this batch where you people are going to get running notes you people are going to get running notes and videos you are going to get these videos are not downloadable just you have to watch the videos every class we are going to record right so that particular videos we are going to share for you people by using Google Drive okay so and also if you want you can attend the live classes anyway so we are going to share a permanent link from next we converts you can use that link to attend the live classes if anyone is unable to attend the live classes don't worry you can purchase the videos I mean you can register for this batch and you can watch the video after completion of the class maximum with within two or three hours our admin team are going to upload these recorded sessions into Google Drive you can able to access and these videos access is so for six months you are going to get from the date of registration you are going to get up to six months that's why so the people who are willing to continue you can attend the live classes otherwise you can get registered and you can watch the videos also no problem okay next sir next term sir to whom we need to contact so I am interested in this batch to whom we need to contact it so nine two four six nine two four six two one two one four three you can contact to this number or so seven two zero seven seven two zero seven two one two four two seven you can contact to any one of this number or you can also mail to durgasoft training at the rate gmail.com so this is nothing but what is the information about this course what is the information about this after here prerequisite sir prerequisite for this course is nothing but compulsory at least you should you you you should know the basics of python the basics of python sir how to print a message how to execute a Python program what are the fundamentals required so everything looping statements everything you should know otherwise it becomes somewhat difficult to understand these data structures because here we are not going to teach python so already some data structures will be there suppose if you are implementing any Project without data structures we are not going to implement the project in such cases while implementing the Project based on that a project requirement you have to select one data structure okay anything it can be a stack or it can be a queue or it can be a linked list compulsory you need to sell data structures okay so for that this course is going to be helpful for you people for that this course is going to be helpful for you people okay start coming to the syllabus what syllabus we are going to cover sir chapter wise we are going to cover the syllabus uh just a second I am going to show you the test syllabus you can see here this is nothing but the syllabus this is the tentative syllabusa okay this is the tentative syllabus compulsory all the topics within this particular syllabus we are going to cover maybe we will add some extra content okay or we will Shuffle this order but the concepts are same like just let me revise of our uh five minutes sir introduction to DSA like why we need to go for data structures and algorithms what advantages are there how we can able to solve the problem all these introduction related to DAC and Analysis of algorithms how you can able to analyze the algorithm so if I want to prepare any algorithm what important things are required once if you convert once if your problem statement is ready and once if you prepare the algorithm how you can able to convert it into the Python program and what are the different approaches are there to solve problem and algorithms and some implementations in this completely you are going to get we are going to revise the python Concepts like suppose if I am getting any problem like prime number application is there so I want to give input as a number and we have to check whether that member is prime number or not similarly I have 5 numbers is given as a input I need to take those five numbers from the defined numbers I want to find out so maximum number largest value okay or I want to perform search operation like some basic programs so in this chapter we are going to revise the python how you can able to write python if any if condition is there how you can write it so in this two advantages we are going to get one is nothing but so you are going to learn how you can able to write algorithms on the program second second thing so the people who don't know about python they are going to revise the concepts because learning programming language is not a difficult task nowadays so whatever previous programming language knowledge that you have definitely it is going to be helpful the only change is nothing but syntaxes so once if you understand these 30 programs maybe we are going to spend some two days or three days once if you are clear with that three days you people are going to get a full-fledged knowledge on at least basics of python then our python Pi default is going to support some inbuilt data structures okay my python is going to provide support for some inbuilt data structures like string data structure is there list data structure is there Tuple data structure is there set data structure is there dictionary data structure is there so how you can able to work with these data structures what are the various methods are available all these parts we are going to discuss in this inbuilt data structure now we are going to see what is list data structure something like it is related to eraser programs on list data structure we are going to see some example programs under programs on matrices okay so programs on matrices string data structure programs on strings sorting and searching applications minimum 50 applications we are going to see recursion and its applications okay backtracking means what how you can work with backtracking so divide under conquer algorithms like if you are getting any big problem so there is one approach is there so cutting that a problem or dividing that problem into individual steps so finally if you are getting solution for those individual problems combining the solutions will become the solution for the big problem so majority of universities colleges some organizations are going to use this particular technique so management is going to divide the task for some people so those people are again dividing the tasks too so their subordinates again they are going to divide the task into their subordinates like level by level the problems are going to be solved okay next you know very well I think you heard about this linked list concept so what is mean by Linker list how these linked lists are going to be helpful in our real time so what are the different types of linker lists are there sir there are four types of linked lists are there one is single linked list second one is double linked list so third one is circular single linked list fourth one is circular double linked list so with the help of this Linker list how you are going to perform various operations suppose I have a linked list is there like this just a forever example I am taking I have a linked list is there in the system some four nodes are there here so what is my requirement here is I want to I want to add a new node okay so I want to add a new note so in which location assume I want to add a new node here what we have to do we need to break this link and this node next field will become this one and this field this node next field will become this one like already existing link you have to break and you need to connect a new node there suppose sometimes we can insert a node at the beginning also sometimes we can insert the node at the ending also okay this is nothing but at some particular position like there are n number of operations are there how to reverse the link list is the linked list is palindrome or not how you can able to check like there are various operations are there all these things we are going to cover in detail in our Linker list chapter it is a big jump pressure which takes around four to five classes okay there we will talk then you know I think you heard about this one like uh data structure stack data structure okay all which is going to follow lifo technique have you have you remembered this one the objects which we are inserting at the last will be the objects that we are going to retry first like we have one algorithm is there which is nothing but stack so there are applications also there in the stack recursion is going to completely work based on stack if if anywhere reverse concept if you want to do then we can go for this stack and the queue data structure is there which is going to follow fifo like you can see everywhere we are using queue right if you want to get a tickets so for any bus or any train or if you want to get registration okay so definitely you people are going to stand in a queue so that is called as a queue writer the person who is uh getting lost okay so sorry the person who is getting faster will get a first priority based on that we are going to assign the task okay so even in the system also foreign so from bottom to top will comes under stack okay so the ladies ladies are going to wear the Bangles right so it is also which kind of data structure stack data structure the last bangle which you are putting into your hand you are going to remove that bangle only faster so the first inserted bangle You country you can't remove sir it is not possible okay so like we have different uh what you can call algorithms we can Implement on this how to create the stack in detail we are going to discuss next and after that hash table so for performing better search operations we can go for hash table data structure for performing better search operations we can use this hash table data structure so how you can able to work with that that we will discuss in the upcoming classes then three data structure there are four trees that we are going to cover like binary trees binary search trees AVL trees red black trees okay like we are going to cover four trees in detail about these four trees we are going to discuss so one week purely we are going to spend on this data structures only that much important is nothing but data structures what we have okay that much important is nothing but data structures what that we will discuss okay sir one second this short order the recording has stopped right so next and after that there is one more data structure is there called Heap Heap so there is one concept is there with the name prioriticus okay so we are going to see how the superiority queues are going to work so something it is internally hip data structure so there are some Specialties are there that we will discuss similarly graph you can see in the graph suppose if you take shortest path so in the Google Maps are there right Google Maps are completely going to work on this graph data structure only so if you want to move okay from one location to another location so we will have multiple paths will be there among those multiple paths we are going to select only one path which is going to provide the shortest results that we are going to cover here okay so next and after that there are so many concepts are there in the graph sir I am not going in detail every topic just at the top level what things we are going to cover that I am explaining so next and after that dynamic programming so what is mean by dynamic programming how we can able to implement a dynamic programming see uh these are programming techniques are algorithm technique so you can enjoy these classes because that much important concepts are there and that much uh interest you people are going to get all these things are same 3D method and how you can able to work with bit manipulations so time under space complexities okay of all these algorithms because that is very very important so before implementing the algorithms we need to analyze the time and space complexities how much time we are going to take how much space we are going to require see if you see any algorithm suppose I have this particular problem came into my situation so then how you can able to solve that a problem so we have n number of ways will be there I am going to solve the problem by using one approach my friend is going to solve the problem with some approach my student is going to solve the problem with some approach my senior is going to solve the problem with some approach so for a single problem multiple some three to four algorithms three to four programs three to four implementations will be there among these four which is the best sir you can't decide right so there are some measurements are there by using that we are going to decide that is nothing but what time and space complexities sir nowadays we are going to ignore the space complexities but the time complexity is very very very important for each and every algorithm we will see the time complexity and how it is going to be derived also we are going to discuss so this is nothing but the concept the concept which we are going to discuss in our upcoming classes okay so I request everyone to please confirm is the concepts are clear for you people yes sir I request everyone if you are having any questions you can feel free to ask and again I am repeating this batch timings is not from 7 to 8 this batch timings is from 8 to 9 sir okay from the coming Monday onwards you have to attend at eight o'clock but these demos maybe four to five demos will be there okay so the people who are willing to continue you can start registering from today itself so that you will get all the videos access okay and running notes everything from Deva okay so this is a demo session and actually it is the regular classes we are going to start the regular classes can we solve Fang company questions by using this class as a c it is not related to a specific company sir okay so uh you need to understand the concepts of these data structures if they are asking the questions related to this data structures definitely you can able to answer okay because it is concept oriented programming suppose if they are asking so I have one expression is there can you please write a python or Java or you can you please explain the concept uh explain the algorithm to convert this particular expression into post tricks so how to convert one expression from uh infix to post to fix or infix to prefix like that stack data structure is there by using that we are going to see so that part we will discuss okay any other any other queries feel free to ask your queries right can I start please confirm can I start yes right right sir I am going to start the first chapter okay I'm going to start the first chapter uh this first chapter is nothing but data structures okay so data structures and data structures comma algorithms algorithms and Analysis analysis of algorithms this is nothing but the first chapter completely introductions completely introduction sir let us talk about data structures data structures sir what is mean by data structure very simple organizing organizing the data okay so organizing the data is called as data structure data structure so why we need to organize so if the data is if the data is in organized steel organized still so then easy easy to perform easy to perform various operations easy to perform various operations that is nothing but the agenda and I request everyone to please be on mute amreen so if the data is in organized still then what we are going to get easy to access okay easy to access are easy to perform easy to perform various operations whether it may be accessing or insertion or anything it is very easy Once if the data is in organized manner okay that's why we are going to organize the data structures for example you can see maybe you have faced these things in your real time sir have you observed in the college library if you take a college library suppose consider so an engineering college is there PTEC college is there okay so there you may see n number of subjects will be there okay n number of labs will be there like for everything records okay lab manuals text to books so reference books okay exercises books like so many books we are going to depend in the B Tech okay okay sir what what we are going to do Suppose there there will be a separate room will be allocated a big room they are going to allocate for storing the books suppose consider the books are not in an order the books they have kept in the room like anything okay so now you have to go and you need to pick up the book whichever you required sir do you know how much time it is going to take even if you spend one complete day also you can't select the book If the books are not in organized step Okay the reason for that is what suppose consider this is your classroom or this is your library library room room is there area entrance is there sir if the data is in this style is it possible to select the data nothing not possible not at all possible okay it takes so much of time so much of effort is required so your complete day is going to waste sir what is alternative for this array our management is going to purchase some racks so they are going to maintain the library sir do you know in this particular beautiful manner okay so how they are going to maintain sir one rack they are going to keep here so another rack they are going to keep here so another rack they are going to keep here another rack they are going to keep here like that they are going to keep tracks so do you know this first rack Belongs To Sir computer science students computer science students sir if you are a computer science student then what we have to do you need to enter and you need to go to this first block they are going to give a label like CSC in this CAC again there are multiple subjects are there sir maybe you are you are searching for data structures sir the books alphabet wise they are going to arrive the books whose name starts with yay will be available here the books names whose names starts with the B will be available here c will be available here T will be available what is your next move from here to here and in this maybe hundreds of books will be there so based on author they are going to arrange the books in this step so you need to see which author book you required and you have to select that sir how much time it is going to take maximum one minute to two minutes is sufficient okay so once if you enter within one or two minutes you can able to get that book and you can come up suppose in these if the book is not available then what is a conclusion sir the book is not available yes because sir the data is arranged in a proper structure so easily we get able to perform even search operation if the data is not available in that block then what is the meaning there is no chance of getting that data in other blocks also okay because like that we implemented data structure so in the in the library if a 10K books are there is it required to search for all the 10K books no so depending on your category of book you can able to search only in maybe 100 book selectors sir search operation how much how much efficient is this one sir do you know yesterday I visited one medical shop for purchasing some medicines okay uh for My Mother sir do you know um first time I visited that Medical Shop it is a it is a top rated medical so they they have given the labels in the racks so like yay okay next and after that to be next and after that c t e like that so now I got shocked first time I have I am seeing like that sir then medical the medicine sir the tablet name which starts with B will be available in that particular area okay it is very easy easy right so um medicines medicines so in medical shop in medical shop medical shop or magic medical store so they are going to arrange in a proper data sir all these things are data structures or not yes so by using these data structures what advantage we are going to get easy to perform various operations if you want to search for the data it will be very easy if you want to sort the data it will become very easy so these operations okay we can perform very effectively sir the following the following are the common operations the following are the common operations so that we can perform on any data structure that we can perform on any data structure so what are the common operations that we can perform the first operation inserting the data inserting the data assume in this some books are there I I purchased some new book how to insert that book into this library that is called as insert operation okay next and after that deleting the data from this particular books for example assume the university people deleted one subject okay from the engineering in that place so they have introduced some news object or they have reduced one subject from engineering CAC Branch or ECE brand something like that so then what we have to do once if it is applied if that circular is issued so the books related to this particular subjected we have to remove from the library or not yes so that you will get more space then updating the data there are already some books are there so some subject is replaced with or some subject is the same but author is replaced with some other author then what we have to do old books you have to remove in that place we have to move new books is it a replacement replacement sir it is called as deleting or not yes sir sorting sorting sorting the data sir I got again new thousand books I got okay or I got some 100 books then what library people are going to do they will sit and they will organize the books according to the uh serial order Department wise like that and they are going to put it in a proper place so it is a manual step only one time activity now I want to perform search operation the example I have shown already right searching for the data how easy it is okay these are the common operations okay these are the common operations for example I want to display the list of books in the entrance sir it is called as display display display or printing or printing or the technical term for this is nothing but a traversing Etc so these these operations commonly we can perform on the data structures in every data structure we are going to touch all these operations in addition to that you may get new operations also okay I think friends you people got some idea about what is mean by data structure at a top level at the top level can you please confirm everyone is this concept is clear for you people friends please confirm everyone yes is it clear up to this whatever we covered right so next term classification classification of data structures sir how you can able to classify the data structures how many types are there how you can able to divide it okay how you can able to divide sorry anyone having idea how many types of data structures are there any idea foreign AR okay anyway we will discuss about that in the tomorrow's sessions so tomorrow same timings you have to join at seven o'clock tomorrow we are going to see sir already the syllabus got started I request everyone those who are willing to continue you can make starting the payments and the regular classes will be there from Thursday or Friday that I will inform you and these classes will be there from 8 AM to 9 00 am in the upcoming classes okay yeah this week completely we will have at 7 am but next week onwards our classes will be at 8am 8 to 9 o'clock every day 8 to 9 o'clock Saturday and Sunday there won't be any classes but occasionally I will take because depending on the topic we have to see okay suppose if the topic is a bit lengthy so some two hours two and a half hours Concepts may be there so in such a cases I may take one Saturday okay Sunday definitely there won't be any session okay so tomorrow class timings is from seven o'clock this week I'm repeating again this week completely the class is from 7 AM to 8 A.M okay right sir so thank you for attending the demo remaining things we will discuss in the tomorrow's class okay thank you sir

lead code 572 subtree of another tree check if a given tree s is a subree of tree t this means s must have the same structure and node values as some subree within t not valid cases are if the p tree has some node but none in the q tree if none in the p tree but the q tree has some node if both trees have nodes but values are not equal valid cases are both nodes are none both nodes are not none and also both values are the same for example three and three there are two trees one is from the left hand tree and another from the right hand side we need to find if the given right hand side tree fits into the left hand side tree first node zero i mean node value is zero but in the right hand node the value is one which is not equal so search in the left node yes both the node values are one we might fit inside this branch of the tree so check further node two both are equal again go left both are none return true to node two now go to the right node of two both are none return true to node two we got both values as true meaning until now below we have matched it true and true return it as true to node one we have done in the left part now check it in the right part three and three both are equal going left both are none none return true to node three now going right again both are none and none return true to node three we got both is true so using the in operator true and true return true to node one again true and true return true to node zero well we already have found the sub tree should we go right and check again is it really needed no so just return the received true finally let's understand one hidden edge case as we can see there are two trees one on the left and another on the right hand side now try the right tree fit into the left tree yes it's fitted but but the one node 7 is not present already so it should be false all coding problems are organized and available on drcode.org we are going to solve this problem using recursion first set the base case if any one of the trees is none we should stop it here and return by checking both the trees are none which means it might be valid or else invalid if both root value and subtree value are the same there is a possibility to fit the tree so call the same tree function by giving both the current node yeah we haven't defined it now we will do it later if we got true from same tree just return true or else check it again with left node of root and same subroot and another one from right node of root and same subroot now defining same tree first of all set the base case if any one of the tree is none if not or not b return as should be both trees are none now check both the nodes have the same value and check left using the same function send the left node of a and left node of b now check the right node using the same function send the right node of a and right node of b finally return by setting the condition as should check and left check and right check all are true it is true oh i made a typo over here rewrite as lower t for tree and again in the right side and submit one final time

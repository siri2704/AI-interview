hi good evening to all yeah today we'll solve our next question probably the question number four in the same series array as frequency counter and I hope in the previous last three questions you understand what is the pattern of ar frequency counter so before I begin with the solution and the problem statement uh let me have an audible and visual to all my primary coding person is Python coding language is Python but now I'm finding that most of the companies don't want Python uh correct son of actually for DSA nobody will recommend you to use Python but if you are doing like DSA in Python and along with this you're doing development in Python only then it is sensible otherwise you need to change right otherwise you can prefer Java or SQL or something for the DSS basically okay but if you're doing like data science or you're doing E IML something then Python is good Python is good okay cools are cool how's the energy and 10 hours of count is very less count is very less can I have more bigger count actually I have one dream that thousands of people will coming and seeing here try one thing help me in one thing that share this live to somebody who need it okay let's begin with the problem statement i'm Garand mentor friend and today we'll solve a question number four in the same series ar frequency counter okay the problem statement that we are uh hi Fedat the problem statement that we targeting today is that's trust me very cool problem okay and anyhow that's a that's a good problem which repeatedly been asked in multiple companies I've given you the few names here the bundage Samsung Amazon Goldman Sachs and the problem name is find missing and repeated values and this is also based on the ar frequency counter in the same series Okay in the same series I always say that when you want to master DFA practice topic wise and anyhow that's why I created a series where you're practicing multiple questions on the same topic only then that topic will be clear to you okay okay so let's move ahead over lead code that we'll solve our problem statement first we'll understand what is the problem statement then we will solve it okay so the problem statement is now the problem statement is now uh hi infinite bytes now the problem statement is we're given a zero index 2D integer matrix grid of size n by n means we will have one grid that the multiplic grid will be n by n with values in the range 1 to n² you know that when you apply as a frequency counter you always have values you always have values one to n right but once you have 2D array you have two twodimensional dictionary you have two dimensional like list or something that time you will have value to n² why I'll tell you the reason don't worry and then each integer appears exactly one except which appears twice and b which is missing So what is the thing is that you will have one 2D array or 2D list or 2D vector something then our job is to find what the task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B okay so let's see the problem statement we'll see the example example is grid that you have 1a 3 and 2a 2 so the thing is I'll tell you I'll tell you from the example itself otherwise you'll be confused so here the example is and what was the name of the array that was grid okay okay so 1 comma 3 2a 2 so you have one grid okay you have two dimensional something 1 3 and 2 so they mention that you will have value as 1 n² okay so tell me what the size of this grid you'll say 1 and two so the size of the grid of not two which means the value will have 1 2 n² means the value will have 1 to four right so the thing is that their burn value is repeated and if something is repeated that definitely has you know occupied the place of something right and burn value is missing so we need to find that only we need to find that only so what we need to find we need to find missing and repeated this is what we're looking for this is what we're looking for so what we'll do if I want to use a frequency counter so the the simple ideology it's what we'll create an array and any of we know the value will be 1 2 n² and that is the first condition of using a frequency count whether you will have value to n first thing or 2 n square right second thing is that all the value will be positive and third thing is that there will be some dependency on the frequency so let's figure out do we have a frequency on the dependency on the frequency let's see let's see okay so now here if you simplify this grid you will have you will have what i'll create one you'll simplify this grid you will have what let look at this you will have 1 3 2 tell me is there something missing here is there something missing here you'll say yes something is missing what is missing if values should be b to four then four is missing four is missing first thing who is repeated this two is repeated but how you get to know how you get to know how you will write the code for it right that is a question how will you write code for it so that simply what we'll do is that we'll create one frequency array okay and that frequency tell me what will be the size in the from the first video till here I've always told you in this particular series ar frequency counter that you will always create a frequency array of n + one why because if If you have value 1 to n means 1 to four you'll have size five why because only then you can utilize this four as index so you create a five size means what the size of the grid multiply by this like grid multiply by grid what is the size okay grid plus one so which means this is size is 2 2 m* 2 + 1 becomes five right so the five size you create so let's say 0 1 2 3 4 these are the indexes of that particular frequency array okay so now now correct son so now what you will do now what you will do tell me you'll count the frequency of each element and you will utilize the element of this grid as a index of this frequency array yes or no tell me yes or no that's what we do in add frequency counter right we use the value of the array or the list in the frequency as indexes so let's say we have one go on index do++ so on index you will have one yes or no yes or no tell me in the comments yes or no now again you have three now tell me on third index what you will do plus plus by default all the value will initialize to zero again on the second index you will do plus it was zero now this became one now again you have two so you'll do plus now tell me when you will do plus one on the value of one you will have two here and the rest values are zero right so anyhow you'll ignore this zero why because you have value from 1 to n² so zero is not important here what is important is this whatever index will have value as two that is repeated so two is here whose value is repeated and again whatever the index will have value as zero that is missing so four is missing right four is missing yes or no so you will have your output so now the thing is that output will be output will be 4a 2 or 2a 4 that we'll see that what we want to give first missing or repeated that you'll see from the output into itself so look at they are telling 2a 4 which means first repeated then missing first word tell me first repeated then missing right so this is what we want to do so now I hope everybody has understood the code the problem statement I hope clear to all the solution is also clear to all that the basic fundamental approach we will have one frequency array there will count the frequency those element will have frequency as two they are repeated if only one is there and again the element which have frequency at zero that is missing I'll give that particular value in different array in different list on different vector based on the language right yes how's the energy I can't see a lot of interaction in the charts I want to see interaction energy that are really serious about the things okay okay so now now let's write the solution I'll write the code first I'll write the code in three languages okay in Java and deep learn Python as well so now here now here what I'll do first I want one and I'll calc the size first okay so let's say size something probably size is good right size good name so what is the size of this grid tell me uh great so dot length so that's how you calculate the length in in Java so you will have this size now tell me what will be the size of now now sounds people are serious now here what we'll do we'll have one list or one array or own vector depending on the language now we are writing in Java so we will have one array so we'll create an frequency array okay tell me what will be the size new and here we pass the size multiply by size means square of the size right why because you have 2D array so square of the size + one so if you have size h2 you will do five so size will be five only then you will have last index h4 right so this is created the frequency array when I want the result because any we are returning result in array itself so I'll give another array of two size okay so let's say result and that has size as two okay a two size array now what I'll do I'll count the frequency so for loop I'll utilize or for each probably I'll utilize and I will have another array because this is 2D array tell me when you will iterate this grid you will have another array yes or no when you'll iterate this particular array you will have another array so what I'll do I will have another array here so I'll let's say write a row or something because this is pointing out to rows one row is 1a 3 second row is 2a 2 so colon I'll use the for each loop here so great okay okay so we are itating the grid right so now we are having one error row again so for getting the value what you have to do you have to itate this row again okay so for um now you will have value colon row row is another array and now what we'll do that we always do tell me frequency value ++ yes or no that's what we have to right and now here we'll write the logic we'll itate our frequency array into I equals to0 or we can directly it something whatever it feels good to you i is less than uh frequency dot length and then I ++ what we do every day yes or no right and here what we'll write like if if what if the frequency is two which mean that is repeated yes or no frequency is two means if on a particular index you have W as two we can say that is repeated and if that is repeated that it will go where on zero index look at this that is going on zero index so I'll write here result on zero index I'll put the value of I if this is not case then we'll check the another case the another case is the frequency I zero if that is zero means that is missing if frequency of whatever element is zero that is missing and that is missing we'll put where wizard on index right and that here I'll put the I it will keep doing it right we'll keep doing it and then at the end at the end I will return my result right again those people are watching this video for the first time I request all of them to watch the series from starting like if you want to learn average frequency counter watch the first video then second and third this is probably fourth question only then you'll understand completely okay that's why I'm covering multiple problem again you'll be able to make it for solution okay cool yeah so now I'll run this it is accepted then I'll submit it and in which language you need a dry writing comment I at the last I'll count the book okay meeting 100% then can somebody tell me what is the time complexity of it yeah and now this will run till n only right and this is only two times you have 2D array only right or or something 2D array I don't know 2D array or something but uh probably no no you can have multi array so here you will have this m and n is like m n means you can say probably n² time complexity you will have n square and that is the best possible solution why is that because yeah gradient matrix both are same I'm not needed and now look at after four question you understood problem statement completed the solution as well and great you'll do you'll do well in life okay okay so Java okay cool now now what we'll do is that what we'll do we'll copy this particular code now we'll convert the same code in C++ then in Python you need in Java we'll do in that okay so now in C++ here okay in C++ what you don't have this length method you have size method okay you have what you have s method for vectors and uh this is how not you create the vector in basically in C++ you create vector with the help of vector notation right so what I'll do I'll I'll remove this everything I'll write here a vector and here the type is end name frequency right and size will be this cool here now for result Also we need another vector but any you have to initialize the value i want the initial value to be zero because in C you have the garbage value if you not initialize it so vector int and here I'll write result here I'll write result okay and the size should be two and the value initialize zero and once you watch this particular series from starting trust me nobody can beat you in DSA after a certain time but for that purpose we have to be consistent that is one thing I want from you end okay so now how will you apply this for loop here because you don't have Java here you have vector so we'll use vector here vector that stores the inter value and the name is the row because you have nested vectors right and the rest thing the size also you'll not use here you'll use size at the place of length okay and probably now the same code it is any of Java and C++ have the similar syntax almost and for me every language is sounds similar to me in terms of learning and writing code just few things are changed uh it's waiting 3 millisecond because we using one something like that is causing the problem but now it's waiting 100% but it depends like where the system is mostly busy or not but it's a good solution it's a good solution one optimization is also possible here you are creating a copy if you don't want to create a copy of it you want the reference right because you're creating a new vector every time don't want to create it so you can have auto and here at the address of so mean data type will be automatically defined and the row you will have that and that will optimize little memory because now you're not creating a different array different vector you utilize the previous one only look at this memory has been reduced running faster than previous cool now we'll run the same code in Python also in Python as well i'll go here will change in Python as well so you don't have directly length method here and the data type also so I'll write size equals to length method we have to calculate the length i like grid that is a list here and again you don't have this but you'll do multiply right for uh having the size so I will remove this i will have one frequency list frequency equals to that will initialize that value as zero and multiply with this so now you have n plus like n² + 1 size uh list for result also you need another list so I'll create a result by default the value is zero and the size is two okay so now how youated you don't have for each loop in Python you have for in loop so for row in in what in grid right colon and again for this also you will utilize utilize the foreign loop only so for bell in row okay colon and then you don't have plus+ you'll do plus to 1 okay now you remove this you will remove this and then I know people will learn different languages also here I'm coding it so now for i in range range of what range of uh length like one comma starting from one not zero and because that is not necessary you have value from 1 to n² only and the length of frequency array that we do every day right now here I'll remove this we will have one colon I will remove this don't have semicolon here we'll remove this you don't have else if you have in python okay and I'll remove this and this color also and now I'll remove this And this also now this is code in Python okay this is code in Python so I'll run it every code has already converted in Python itself running fine i'll remove this probably this extra space okay this is code in Python now the same code you just created two list one frequency list for storing the frequencies second for the result okay but this is little bit slower than the C++ and Java that you have to so what is the difference between Python and Python 3 python 3 is a upgraded version of Python you will have multiple features multiple different features okay but look at this this is consuming less memory than the other languages in terms of memory it's better look at this memory 18.23 MB but time is taking more but memory it's being optimized okay so now now we'll do dry run in Java okay i guess people were asking for Java for doing a tyon in Java so we'll do that in very fast speed because any of you watching this particular live from starting then probably you will have very good understanding uh I'll keep this here my pointer I'm not able to find keep this now again my actually cursor has gone not how I will insert not here how to cut it yeah probably I will not be able to uh paste it here probably there was one glitch in my system i can't see my cursor i can't see my cursor but no worry I'll explain you right here where I'm going here uh I'll try to explain you through my cursor okay from this only from this only so now now look at this we had created bar like we have the size for 2D array okay the size is probably for example in this example look at the example number my cursor is not going there but no worries I'll explain you right here okay so now we're calculating the size of the grid that is two as of now for example in example number one and then we're calculating the size of our frequency array why because you want to use this frequency to count the frequencies each and the indexes I will use as the value of the grid right so if you have like nested then you have to create a nested size also so for example you have 2a 2 a matrix or grid you'll create a nsar + one size so that's what we are doing here and then yeah probably if I guess no I will not get my cursor anyhow uh but here I am now I don't know so now for result actually you will have only one missing and repeating values so that's why I'm creating a two size array here and again we're using for each loop here this row will have the inner array this row will have the inner array right so now this internal loop will have the value from that inner array and we're utilizing that value as a index of frequency as a index of frequency right and every time frequency will be plus+ of that particular index and the element which will have the frequency as two that is repeated we will put that of zero index and the element that has frequency at zero we will put that on one index right and at the end we return an output and I hope now this is clear to all if somebody have any confusion do let me know otherwise we can gap otherwise we can gap is this clear to all do let me know please is this clear to all i hope that this is clear to all now see you in the next live maybe I will have next live on uh Friday not Friday on Saturday and Sunday saturday and Sunday okay timing you already know on Saturday and Sunday I come at uh at 6:15 live timing is 6:15 okay great great yeah again what I want is that everybody will be consistent and once you achieve success in life just aim that thing and achieve it and when you tell once you tell me that story of yours that you have achieved something I'll be very happy to hear that okay thank you Sam i'll be very happy to hear that wish you all the best see you in the next live till then keep practicing keep practicing similar questions okay you can get similar question in the below tab here i don't know what happened to my system here just I'm not able to scroll or something but here you'll get the similar question problem also uh where you will have similar problem somewhere you'll figure out you'll get similar problem try to solve them okay and if you're new then please watch the series from the starting i want at any call that you must be successful in life bye-bye to all see you in the next live be energetic and stay motivated bye-bye to all yeah now probably I cannot mean stop the live i cannot stop the live also

hey folks uh I guess I'm light enough let me just check if everything is working as expected and if there are no hiccups we can get started in a few minutes all right so just a second let me let me see if I can see my own stream hey folks yeah I can hear myself I can see myself no issues so as always just like the previous life sessions I'll wait for a few minutes for everyone to join in I try to join in a few minutes early so that if there are any technical hiccups I can fix them so we'll start the live itself as far as see data structures algorithms are concerned we'll start at at 7:03 p.m. till then I'll answer a few questions that are on the chat window right so let's go some so is practice important or revision or syllabus completion again remember that what is your objective here that's very important right if you have covered a good chunk of syllabus a good chunk of syllabus then your top priority should be a revision and practice simultaneously you can't skip one or the other actually solving problems is a very good form of revision in itself right so that's one strategy if you have one or two subjects that are still left look at all the analysis videos that you have put wave also as requested by some of you we have made a playlist of all these subject wise analysis if there is one or two subjects that you think will take a lot of time that you might want to skip look at how important what is the weight age of marks that you can expect based on the last twelve question papers in the last five years if it's okay if you think okay I'll skip this but I'll focus more on the others you can make that informed choice skipping a subject is okay but again it will hurt your rank let's be realistic but instead of skipping a whole subject you might want to skip some of the harder topics in that and that that's why we are doing this analysis right for every subject we tell you a subset of topics which are most scoring and if you get an easy question in that topic that's that's like take what question right so if if there is no way you can complete a subject it's okay to skip one worst case two subjects but you should focus more on the subjects that you have already done well in if but my strong recommendations my strong recommendation is instead of skipping a whole subject keep only some topics focus on some topics which are very very scouring primarily because there could be easy questions there and you could score lots of questions lots of marks there right so it's all about the strategy of preparation see one of the biggest challenges with gate is the enormity of the syllabus right there is a lot of syllabus there is like literally like what 1314 subjects from your undergrad and up from your undergraduate level computer science curriculum so I understand that it is sometimes tricky for example I skipped computer networks when I was preparing the first time I wrote my gate in my BTech third year in those days we could write our gate exam in 30 and also I skipped computer networks of course I didn't get a single digit or a double digit rank I ended up getting 176 all right so I've missed the easy questions in that subject I also made some silly mistakes here and then the next year I did not skip any anything I did not skip any subject I did thorough revision analysis practice of every subject I got a very good rank which is rank too right so um okay so where would be a optimal time to stop giving full-length text prior to get I would say give the gate X give the exam almost in the last week the reason I suggest that is because every Sunday if you start taking these mock tests you get or or maybe twice a week if you start taking these mock tests you get into that habit of sitting at a specific time which is exactly the gate time the time at which the gate exam starts sit at that time set for three hours try to solve a paper you get into the habit of solving question papers because gate there is so much of revision to be done so we reckon we recommend that you practice mock tests till the very last week so that the last exam feels like one other weekly mock test for you right sounds good okay so we're working on some other subjects notes which is still pending we'll do that okay again we want the best quality notes we don't want to take any shortcuts there that's why the whole team is sitting on writing the notes we should upload it soon yeah we'll upload it guess we'll upload it just just give it some time okay we don't want to do it in a hurry and mess it up just the way we we always ensure to keep the quality extremely high we're double checking triple checking sometimes ensuring that everything is in place before we do it okay where were we okay sounds good so there are some questions here but let's do one thing let's dive into since it's already seven I think a good chunk of people have also joined so let's do one thing I'll dive into see data structures algorithms focus on the most important topics will do it through data because the only thing as as a machine-learning scientist or an X machine learning scientist who's still studies machine learning I believe a lot in data right so let's look at data here I'll share these sheets with you little later so don't worry about this I'll share these sheets just like the other live sessions that we conducted first we'll focus on C and data structures we didn't want to separate C and data structures because there is a lot of overlap of questions right again just like in the previous live sessions we analyzed all the question papers from 2014 to 2019 some years have multiple question papers right some years have multiple question papers because because in those years like in 2017 there were two papers that were given so overall these are all the major topics and here miscellaneous topics basically means again you have your linkedlist arrays back and cue binary search trees AVL trees binary trees heapsort hashing our heaps right heap not heap sort per se but he as a data structure loops and arrays function calling some structures and static keywords pointers miscellaneous topics here basically means topics which require more than one concept here so you do see such questions a lot so if you notice if you notice on an average from just C and data structures this does not include algorithms this is just C and data structures if you notice on an average if you notice you get about twelve marks just from C and data structures if you include algorithms also to it so let's also look at algorithms I will come to algorithms algorithms are an average you can expect six to seven question six to seven max this is the average of the last twelve question papers so just see and data structures is 12 marks algorithms on an average is a six to seven marks that's almost close to 18 to 20 marks just from C data structures algorithms and that the reason gate focuses so much on C data structures algorithms is somebody who is good at C data structures algorithms is most likely going to be good at other areas of computer science also this is the most foundational the most core subject I think in the whole of computer science right and if you look at any product based company what is their interview consists of mostly if some programming language Rheda structures and algorithms this is one of the most important subjects right so now let's look at some high-level analysis then we will go to topic wise analysis right so let's focus on C and data structures then we'll go to algorithms a little later so if you notice again this is in each year how many quite how many marks were there from these topics right and this is this is the total marks in that ear right so if you notice these are the average marks so if you notice your function calling okay from C and data structures your function calling is one topic where you typically tend to see question almost in every paper okay this is about simple function calling recursive functions all of that stuff right pass by value pass by reference all these concepts right so function calling as a topic itself has the highest weight edge in whole of C and data structures followed by miscellaneous topics what does miscellaneous topic here mean miscellaneous topics here mean topics which require more than two concepts here it's not exactly a concept about loops and arrays or function calling it could be a combination of both of them or it could be a combination of structures and pointers right so there will be lot of questions in C and data structures which are combination topics okay so then the third one is loops and arrays along with C loops and arrays on an average almost every year there is some question or other except for a couple of papers most papers there is some very some weight is here the next thing is the next thing is your binary trees AVL trees binary search trees etc okay if you have to pick the four most important topics try to focus on all function calling stuff loops and arrays like because there's so much weight edge here then you have your trees binary search trees AVL trees simply binary tree cetera again binary trees has a concept you'll also learn in discrete mathematics alright then loops and arrays of course there will be some miscellaneous questions if you know this concept you can answer otherwise you will not be able to answer right so this is how you can plan your strategy for preparation look at this again what we have done here is we have taken topic wise just link a list how many questions are there this is the total of all the marks that were there in these twelve question papers if you notice if the total is high that means there is more weight Ã¤j-- right simply simply put again this is for data structures only we will also see the same analysis for c programming if you look at look at this varies a total height the total is high here which means binary trees and binary search trees have the highest max right even within this chapter of binary trees binary search trees and AVL trees binary and binary search trees have the highest vantage right that's one topic that I strongly recommend you don't you don't miss because it's extremely scoring right so next is next is heap heap heap as a data structure there are some questions in the overlap and heap and heap sort also so that's another topic which is very very scoring right so please don't skip that again these are with respect to data structures only I will come to see also as far as data structures is concerned binary and binary search trees have the highest weight edge followed by heap as a data structure and heap sort which is based on heap itself then there are other weightages other importances also we can't simply negate stack and cure this but if you have to pick two topics these are the most scoring topics and consistently you get more marks from these topics right now similarly let's see the analysis for c programming right so these are all the topics in C programming look at in the in these 12 patient papers where did we get most marks from 28 marks we got just from function calls and almost every year there is some just function calls function recursive function calls are called by value called by reference both types of concepts 28 marks literally in the last 12 question papers 28 marks just came from the single concept then the second biggest Vantage is the machinist has been discussed earlier your machine is basically means it's a combination of topics not just one topic on to itself the third most important topic is for loops again for loops and arrays because most often when you have a for loop there are lot of questions which have for loops and arrays together so that's another topic that I don't want you to miss right so as far as C and data structures are concerned the most important topics are function calls some combination questions then your for loops and arrays of course I'm not saying skip the other topics but that's how we can score the maximum marks as far as data structures is concerned your binary search trees and binary trees without doubt the most important topic the most coding topic followed by heaps okay so these this is by focusing a lot on these topics you will then you will end up scoring more marks again this whole data analysis is primarily targeted towards helping you understand which topics you should focus on this does not mean that you can skip other topics if you want a good if you want to get a signal or a double-digit rank you can't skip any topic because one mark could be the difference between a good rank and not-so-good rank right so this is the analysis for C and data structures similarly let's look at algorithms okay so these are all the topics in algorithms for example you have searching and sorting your simple time complexity analysis recurrence relation space time complexity divide and conquer algorithms graph algorithms greedy algorithms dynamic programming and other algorithmic design techniques right so on an average you can expect about six to seven mucks this is a high-level overview right on an average you can expect about six to seven MUX even here if you notice if you notice which topic has the most marks on an average graph algorithms graph algorithms has the highest weight edge in terms of gate followed by your time and space complexity and then followed by your searching and sorting algorithms mostly sorting algorithms right so if you have to pick three topics and prioritized graph algorithms time complexity analysis sorting and searching somebody was asking this question please don't remember time complexity analysis of algorithms by heart right they're very simple to derive I've discussed this extensively in the course videos also in our course videos you can check out some of the free videos if you're not registered student it's very simple to derive actually I don't remember time complexities on my own to be honest with you I'm very bad at it I think the only time complexity I can remember quickly at the top of my head is that for comparison based sorting algorithms it's order of n log in okay that's the only thing that I remember at the top of my head but even if I don't remember it I can prove it in like in my head not a rigorous proof but I can derive things in my head in like 30 seconds maximum 45 seconds okay so deeper understanding is more important than just remembering these formulae by heart okay so now let's go topic wise analysis right so these are all the topics that you have within algorithms again look at this your graph traversals right your graph traversals themselves your depth first search breadth first search huge wait age 30 marks there then your minimum spanning trees type of algorithms shortest path all these algorithms again 24 MUX if you look at the last 12 question papers almost 24 MUX just came from graph algorithms that's how important this topic is then the second topic is the asymptotic analysis where you discuss about time complexity space complexity a recurrence relations again the recurrence relations is also there in your discrete mathematics right when reconciliation is also studied in discrete mathematics right of course here you have your master theorem special cases of master theorem all of that stuff right so again lot of questions you'll get where you're given our algorithm you have to derive its time complexity or space complexity the reason I tell you that I tell you not to remember things by heart is because for these types of questions you will have to derive it on your own and it should be it should come naturally to you right so the most important topic here is graph algorithms almost 24 Mark's 24 marks in the last 12 years followed by synthetic analysis which is 26 marks right once you are done with this look at the sorting algorithms almost consistently except for a few years here and there there is almost 10 marks from just sorting algorithms and sorting algorithms is one of the first early topics extremely simple concept probably you learned this in your BTech first year or second year extremely simple of course you will get some questions from other topics also like some dynamic programming algorithms like so basically some match the following type of questions and things like that but broadly speaking this is the wait age okay we share both these sheets with you I will put it as a first comment as soon as we finish this live session right so these are the most important of the and this is how you scored most and all this is data-driven this is not opinion based this is actually based on data from the last twelve passion papers because opinions are personal well data is absolute right having said that there is also one interesting data that we collected so we sent out a survey to all of our registered students and this is the survey result so we asked people to rate our course from zero to ten ten basically means you're very like you like it and you're very likely to recommend it to others while zero basically means you don't like it so this is the distribution that we got we have got responses only from a small percentage of our students it's very encouraging there are lot of students in the nine and ten there are some students from eight and seven also we got some detailed responses on what do you like about the course most importantly suggestions where we need to improve ourselves right so we take all these suggestions very very clearly and we constantly improve this right there are some stuff which we are already working on for example somebody asked us to to give us notes for all the subjects we are already working on it we'll do it as fast as possible without diluting the quality right but equally importantly we've again all the students who have gotten this in your in your email but haven't responded back please do respond back again we have sent this only to a registered students and we got responses only from a very small percentage of them so I recommend you give us concrete constructive feedback because we want to constantly improve here and we want to make decisions based on data not opinions right so it's very encouraging that a large percentage of our students are in eight nine ten but hopefully we can get all these people also into nine and ten right of course there are small hiccups here and there we're always open to taking feedback and improving it okay so if you have gotten this in your email and if you have not already given us feedback please do give us feedback because that helps not just you and us but all the other students because we take this feedback very very seriously and improve upon it right so having said this let's transition back so since I have covered the most important topics I'll again share these documents with you just give me a second so I can I can answer a few questions here for you because I'm back on the chat window so let's spend a few minutes answering questions then I'll sign off but I'll provide this documents for you okay just just just wait for the termination of this session I'll surely post these two documents so that you can analyze this data yourself and make informed choices okay so somebody is asking why not from 2012 again the we have also done this I think these are big myths that people have that whichever IIT is conducting the exam the toughness of the examination paper depends on that IIT that's not true we have actually validated that with lots of data okay so most questions again I've also talked to people who are who are faculty members at IITs some of them people I know very well some of them my friends my juniors my seniors it seems forget typically every faculty member gives some questions from all IITs and IISc from all participating institutions and the questions are just collated and the exam is conducted by IIT Delhi but the questions come from all around the place okay so that's the fact okay that examination questions have not just set by faculty at IIT Delhi the questions come from everywhere they just are the organising committee that's it okay so don't worry about the reason we focused more on the last five years is because if you look prior to five years there's a huge variance in hardness of questions in the last five years a major observation here is last five years we have 12 papers so lot of data to analyze so in these 12 question papers gate questions have become easier like if you compare it with previous question papers there are some really hard years there are some very easy years but what's happening more recently in the last five years is they are trying to maintain the same quality of question papers but instead of giving all easy or all hard they're giving a good chunk of easy and medium questions but a few tricky questions right so there's strategy of setting a question paper itself has changed somewhere around 2014 so that's why we are focusing on these more recent question papers here the fundamental hypothesis or assumption here is that 2020 question paper also will be similar to the last years and not like a 2012 or to 2007 order 2006 question paper right so that's that that that's the reason why we are analyzing mostly last five year question papers okay where would be okay let's look at so somebody says will it be fine to prepare discrete math now why not say Matz is very very scoring subject you still have a good chunk of days snuff started and again if you have been good at math in your BTech days then finishing district math should be fast right so don't don't if you have time don't skip a subject and if you're serious about getting in the top hundred ranks you cannot effort to skip any subject of course you might get slightly lucky here and there but if you really want to be in the top hundred ranks you can't skip it if you want to be in the top three hundred four hundred ranks you might be able to go ahead with skipping one subject but not more than that especially these subjects like see data structures algorithms which have huge weight edge again you can treat all these three subjects as one subject instead of treating them as three because there is so much of overlap of concepts here right so similarly so similarly my suggestion here is for you guys to cover it in chunks discrete mathematics engineering mathematics just try to finish it in one shot if you've studied discrete mathematics well in your BTech please don't skip it it's very very scoring right okay gate or ISAM xes again is a is a pretty good institute again we have done we have done a live on choosing which institute to go to you can check it out in our previous live sessions that we have done we have gone through each Institute grouped institutions based on their placements based on research opportunities there which institution is good for you I think we also analyzed Institute's like ISI Chennai mathematical Institute etcetera Chennai mathematical Institute has terrific mathematical faculty so I'm assuming their data science course will be heavy-duty math and should be good that's what that's what I would I would suggest okay where were we okay should I need to solve all the previous year last 25 or previous tenure will be good option again if you have time solve as many as possible but I strongly recommend you you start from 2019 go backwards try to go up till 2004 ish but even if you do last 10 years because in the last five years it since there are 12 question papers right because 2014 has I think 3 sets and things like that so try to solve about 15 question papers from the last a few years in the last five years itself there are 12 question papers just go three four more years do it till 2009 2010 I think you are in your claim at least try to do that of course if time permits I recommend you always to go as back as possible but try to do at least 15 last year question papers okay so I didn't understand this this time is right to think about job if getting what I should do I didn't understand this question so again if you're preparing forget try to focus your energies there because the exam is so close you can always prepare for companies interviews even after get because you have time there okay hmm so somebody saying yeah somebody's asking about DSS and elbow please don't skip it it is it's a very very key subject please don't skip it okay so since you have time try to finish it don't fear it just try to go with the flow skipping DSN algo can be deadly dangerous right because even lot of questions in C programming you will have concept overlaps as we have seen the miscellaneous topics it'll have overlaps with data structures some even with algo right so please don't skip see data structures algorithms because it's a very code subject equally important it will help you in other entrance exams also for example I think triple idea Hyderabad has an entrance exam right later next year after the gate exam their focus is heavily on programming heavy heavy focus on programming data structures and algorithms so please don't skip it okay sounds good folks are all the very best then let's I'll wrap it up and I'll share these documents with you all the very best and all the registered students have got an email we are looking forward for your feedback because that helps us enormously improve ourselves in the next few weeks okay see you folks bye-bye

hi everyone today in this particular video I'll tell you something which is you know causing a problem to switch a job to you or if you're a beginner it's making difficult that you're not able to crack coding interviews right and also for the people who are looking for bigger packages but because they are not very proficient in DS in problem solving and that's why they're not able to crack that job so I'll tell you a few strategies i'll tell you few ways by which you can do this because I've done this in past when I was in college and I was the first person who cracked the highest package of the college when I was doing my engineering so my name is Gorapande and today I'll tell you the few important bait the few important tips that can help you to master the DSM and also how you can maximize the problem solving skills because anyhow any you know I was having one discussion with one of my friend who's working in Amazon and we were talking about like he was saying like Gora do you know uh for one problem for one problem at least we are having a team of five people okay and these problems keep coming that is a true but at a time let's say five problem five people are thinking of the same problem and definitely if you have five engineer for one problem then why you have these four people extra one people could solve it why because they want one of the best optimized solution and that's why they're getting paid and one person will solve that particular problem mean every five of them will do a brainstorming and one will come up with the amazing idea with amazing solution and that solution will be implemented and that one person will be the region of the salary of other four people and they'll work in team they'll coordinate they will be coordinating continually and then they will finally help the company to grow so basically in any company people are getting higher salary not because they're working hard because they are solving the problems so today you'll understand how you can start learning problem solving and how you can improve your problem solving skills okay so let's move ahead in the video now the first thing is that like for the beginners okay for the beginners like let's say you are just a third year or fourth year student who are just preparing for the placements now you want to learn the DSA but what is the correct way the you know in college what we do is that we know the what is array what is string like what is array list what is stack Q train graph we know the concepts but still you're not able to solve the problems right solve the problem that is a problem you're not able to solve the problems right the second thing is that somebody tell you the approach somebody tell you the code then you able to understand but you're not able to make the solution by yourself these are the problems which at beginner level people face okay and again if you're starting DSA freshly that you don't know even the topics so what is the correct way to learn should you master should you master all the topics first then practice all the topics that you must know array you must know string you must know array list has set is all the data structure first you know them then you start practicing is this the correct approach no this is not the correct approach what is the correct way which can help you to you know have maximum capacity in problem solving i'll tell you very important method that method is that learn one topic learn one topic that let's say that is an array okay that's an array master on it if you have if you're learning one topic today at least practice for 3 to four days continuously solve around 20 30 problems 20 to 30 good enough problems let's say uh you are solving 10 easy problems then uh 10 medium problems and five hard problems that will be the correct approach and again at the beginner level do not start solving hard level problems start solving easy and medium level problems try to figure out the easiest easiest multiple problem the same data structure then you will have that you know capability of problem solving and I'll tell you one simple trick or technique I don't know you believe or not but that works that works the important thing is that you know there is a one person who want to build a good body so what he'll do he'll do a gym he'll join a gym or probably will have a trainer right then we'll have a proper diet but similarly similarly if somebody want to train your brain how they can how they can like training body will help them will help them to grow their body but how will you train your brain is any particular exercise yes the multiple exercise like chess is a good game for increasing the IQ level right also the multiple puzzle solving that will you know help your brain to understand the problems to increase the IQ level okay and the meditation if you are doing a problem solving you want to improve your brain I'll suggest that do five to 10 minute meditation that is super required only then your brain will be capable to solve multiple problems right and you'll be good in DSA okay so now from this point you are able to conclude one point that is very important point that you'll master one topic master one topic right and then practice a lot at least three to four days 3 to 4 days once you'll do this once you'll do this you will have good understanding on that particular topic then step number two now I know how to solve the problems but how I can maximize it how I can maximize it and I'm telling you one story that is a real story okay not the fake one that is a real story one friend of mine he was very fat very fat but somehow he had a capability to you know see a dream that he will become an army officer so for that purpose actually he have to that finished that race they have one race test in army so that was the problem for him so he start running and he was hardly capable to run 100 m in one go he didn't have that capability slowly slowly what I've seen is that when people were saying to him that no you can't do it you can't do it probably you are not for army you should try something else so what he did is that he never gave up he Keep practicing keep practicing and then then now finally in this recent hiring last year he became I guess some post I don't remember but he has selected army and he was telling his story now he's really healthy you know he has made a very good body also he built that good body but how this thing happened he cracked down I guess there around 4.6 6 kilometer of race something how he did it how he did it the same as problem solving when you start when you start you don't know anything the problem will you know seems very difficult but how you can master it he start from 100 m continuously he was keep practicing every day there was a lot of body pain he was telling me that he you know he didn't calculated how he's running he tried his maximum stamina till that limit when his body was not able to respond He was becoming uncapable to run to walk even that was his condition and he was keep trying keep trying within two years he was able to do this so this is what will happen to you as well that once you start the problem solving it is starting you will never be able to solve the problem right and then what will happen eventually when you'll never give up you'll understand from other solution then you'll try to think in different way at least at beginning level if you're beginner you are beginner this is starting the DSA you should spend at least one to two hour on problem on easy problem then try to solve it if you're not able to make it go and check some from an else solution then try to implement it that can be one way right once you have good understanding then take hardly to 30 minute on the easy problems when you have mastered it hardly 10 to 20 minutes maximax 10 to 20 minutes for solving that particular problem and trust me this takes time problem solving takes time it will not come automatically nobody can teach you DSA in one month when you'll practice it takes years when you practice continuously probably you'll be very good in six month very nice to crack any coding interview but to master on the peak level it takes years right so you have to do that hard work you have to say to yourself yes every day I'll push my limits and that is a way that is a way okay so maximize the problem solving what you have to regularly you have to practice and where you can practice yeah remember there are multiple things there are multiple platforms like leadut Even I'm running a series over YouTube like GFG Geeks for Geeks Hacker Rank try these platforms and why I'm saying you this year if you're in a college trust me people are not doing this if you will not do this you'll regulate it later you'll regulate because every company ask for the profile your competitive programming profile and based on that they'll evaluate you they'll understand how much good you are in the thing okay that's why you must have a good lead code GF or hackering anyone a good profile so start solving problems there and then every day participate in daily challenges and daily challenge yourself that you'll make you'll solve one more problem every day one more problem every day and trust me at the starting it will feel very difficult but when you'll keep going on the path you'll enjoy it you feel the differences right but it will not come in a day it will take time okay so for maximizing you just have to prepare one topic practice a lot start solving problems over lead code and GF chain hacker rank and when you solve trust me the important thing is that do not directly write code over laptop this is a wrong way try to think like if you're not a co coder how will you approach this problem so think in that mindset and try to create a simple approach as a non-coder mind once you will have good approach then start solving on the laptop okay to first on copy for learning purpose I'm telling not for the interview purpose for the for the learning purpose you'll do first you'll read the problem you'll try to solve the copy without using the code you'll just think in a normal way how you can solve it okay and then you'll make a code then you'll keep practicing and trust me time will come when you'll be super strong in DSA again the next thing is that what is the importance of coding contest trust me if you want to check your limits participate in this coding contest And these coding contest comes with the multiple companies hiring as well so what they do is that they sponsor like multiple company the people who are organizing the contest they sponsor multiple companies so whoever got the very good rank they offer they give them an offer but a friend of mine got an offer in Chinese company that was based on cryptocurrency or something and he got that offer from the GFG contest so when you participate in the contest the first thing you'll be preparing yourself for the real time interview the real time difficulty the real time challenges second thing that you will have the opportunity to directly get an offer later that is really amazing and the third and last important thing you will have very very good ranks if you are really doing well in ESA and these ranks will help you to crack even every company the highest chance of selecting your resume right because people being hired for the problem solving only hard work everybody can do and the last thing is that which is the best language for DSA is this Java is this Python is the C++ so now I'll say the factors the one thing is that if you want to do development and DSA I'll say go with Java if you are doing let's say something in data science or a IML and you want to learn DSA I'll say Python and then if you want to perform competitive programming especially If you want rankings so you'll go for C++ this is faster than Java okay and Python and Java is faster than the Python in terms of problem solving I'm talking about okay so you can have your decision because in Java you can solve DSA as well as you can do backend development using spring boot or something in Python as well you can do development you can do like data science IML or something and you can do DSA but in C++ you will not do development directly you just solving the problems but that will be the fast approach the first fast first way okay so now here to conclude everything that at the starting there will be a time when you'll feel that this is not possible to you to solve the problems you get very very you know difficulty level even in the easiest problems so that will come with time at least you must understand the solution of 40 50 questions first okay so prepare one data structure [Music] structure and then start solving at least 20 30 problems then once you have understand the problem solving start solving problems over late code means any coding platform choose anyone participate in participate in contest right and the learning the best learning way is that think in approach that you are not a coder how will you solve this circle problem mathematically or any approach then try to convert that in quoting and trust me the time will come when you'll be mastering the DSA you will have amazing ability to crack any coding interview and trust me I've seen the people who want to switch the organization for the high and for the better salaries but they are not because they don't know DSA they're not very good in problem solving and that's why they're not able to crack the others interview that's this is what challenge they are facing and for beginners they want that I'm very good in development will I get a job no you you have to learn DSA because people will ask you the questions if you're not able to make the solution nobody will give you the job okay so anyhow DSA is super important it and I suggest everybody that start solving it learn one data structure practice a lot at least 20 30 questions spend three to four days on that particular data structure and then start solving mix problems as well choose one coding platform starting that partic time will come when you really good in DSA so this is what I wanted to mention in this particular video also at that you can tell me your DSS story that how you master the DSA i love to hear that see you in the next video till then protic

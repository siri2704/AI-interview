[Music] thank you foreign [Music] class [Music] so how are you all just write up one good evening good evening everyone just write up one if I'm clearly visible and audible to you all just a one and then we'll start a session great great so we will start after two minutes at seven five so that everyone can join okay uh yeah and also guys share this video with your friends and now we are going to have our amazing DSA master class in gulab with technology so this is a day two for those who are in the who were yesterday so they know that what we have covered yesterday we have covered a complete road map all the complete levels of the smru okay and the thing which was left in the last three was the topics okay the topics lies like uh and the topics like what other topics you have to cover in the essay what is the time required how we can practice questions that was the I think the most important thing how we can practice questions and that is what we are going to cover today okay so we will cover everything when I have prepared a complete DSA topic tree for you guys okay that that has that that takes lots lots amounts of hard work and uh time so I have created a complete the essay topic tree for you guys so we will start okay before that guys uh just quickly uh hit the like button okay and subscribe and please share this session with your friends so that everyone can join and then we will start okay so we have some 200 people currently so I want at least 200 likes in the video and then we will start okay great great just quickly hit relaxation let me okay at least after one 100 likes we will start or 150 let's say 150 and then we'll start okay quickly quickly okay let's show everyone those who are in the last class who are in today's class welcome back foreign [Music] it's really amazing it's really amazing okay then let me check the likes count and then it will start okay so we have crossed 100 likes so I think that we can start now okay great okay okay okay okay okay okay fine so guys yesterday we have discussed about the what why and how of the essay like what is the essay why we should learn DSA and how we can learn the essay so that was a thing which we have discussed in the last uh session it means yesterday's session okay and in today's session what we are going to discuss will be the complete topic tree okay because what is this it's fine that DSA is something which is used for basically performing some operations order data which we have sorting searching we have discussed about solving like sorting names we are discuss about searching and an amazing question of searching like to search in infinite array that we we have already discussed in the last class and for for this class for today uh we will discuss with topics so we have lots of Topic in DSA and it requires lots of time but we will discuss each and everything in detail how each topic can be prepared what will be the complete road map I mean from where you will start even someone who doesn't know anything about DSA okay one can start from that level only so I will start from Level number zero of the smru okay so I hope everybody remembers about DSM are you will start from Level number zero and we'll go up to level number six each and every step was included will be discussed will be covered in this particular session okay great good to start good to go great great so let me share the screen Now quickly and then we'll start with it great just a minute let me see the screen okay great so here is the DSA topic 3 okay so I have covered each and everything so as we have discussed basic uh six levels yesterday these are the six levels if you will see the level zero was the stats then Theory then basic problems is immediate problem practice and contest hard problems and plays okay that was the complete and now I have discovered everything in detail this is the complete DSA topic tree the complete road map I will open this and each level by step you will go and then you will tell me you have to tell me that in which level do you are currently in which level you are currently that is what you have to tell me okay great great so guys the first this is you can see that I have divided a complete DSA in four parts level one topics level two two topics level three topics level four topics okay these are the four topics that I have included in this path so we will first of all let's talk about the level one topics the topics which are not so hard which are the basics to start DSC okay so we'll start from the basics one as I told you so we are at the BSC and let's start with the level one topic you can see that I have written level one topics required two months to complete level to three months and level four top you require four months so basically it's nine months of basic things there two plus three plus four so means nine month of learning is there and the rest of the months is for practicing so basically you can cover DS in one year nine months learning the complete topics and then the last three months for practicing DS practicing takes a lot of time okay let's start with it okay so now let's start with the level one so this is the level one you can see which I have added with two months okay so 11 means let's assume that I am a person who doesn't know about anything what is the essay what is coding nothing you don't know you you don't know anything okay so how you will start the first thing pick a programming language so this is the obvious thing that you have to obviously pick up programming language okay that's the obvious first thing you have to do here okay great now guys the second part the second part so let's say that you have picked now you will ask service programming language to pick or what to do so if you can you can pick anyone of it you can pick C plus plus okay let me add you can pick C plus plus you can pick Java you can pick python I will not recommend C or other language because reason being in the industry if we talk about dsh so for DSA these three languages are those which are running okay but if you talk about c c is not much used in the essay the reason being that uh so you don't have that much functionalities and C plus plus is an advanced version of C obviously so C plus is more preferable but for those who don't know C plus plus who for those who don't see only nobody C is just similar to C plus SQL is not a program it's a scripting language actually no it it will never affect it will never affect okay okay so these are three so guys let's let's go level okay so you can pick any one of the three languages but the thing is that if you are targeting uh the the field of SD software development so for software development is it at C plus one Java are more preferable okay but if we talk about the other fields like in Python AI ml data science data analytics for that I can say that python is more preferable okay so these are the two languages that are given only I am not saying that for software python is not there it is there but yeah in Industry Java and C plus which is okay yeah you can prefer a CSR is not that much used okay sure so there are some languages which are uh specific which are targeted specific I'm not talking about development uh I'm fully stacked as well I'm talking about the essay only so let's first talk about that okay now guys after being a programming language I told you yesterday also the next thing that which we have is uh you can see that now we have put two parts uh first is the master syntax basic libraries okay now there are two segments two segments are that maybe you have a prior experience of coding maybe that you have learned coding in your let's say your first year or let's say in your school so that's your path but let's say you don't know anything about coding you don't know anything about coding then what should we do then you have a second path which is how you can grab some basic concepts of coding that are required to start okay that are required to start first thing is you can prepare pattern printing you can work on the concept of pattern printing we have pattern printing okay now if we talk about the next thing so we have loopings then we have control statements okay and after that we have Io Io means input output so these are the four things that you should must know before starting the essay what are the four things are there yeah lecture one is already uploaded on the channel you can see it in the live section okay so pattern printing looping controller and I O these are the four things that are required to before means we get a prerequisite of DSA getting okay great is it fine till now is equal to driven a plus one is it cleared everyone till now okay okay great great now guys now let's say you have you have prepared the complete Basics okay now what to do okay so now we have the master syntax basically you have done this thing you have done with the basics of Aid Masters you have the syntax of a language control statement means like if else statement switch case says uh click this is all control statement if else control statement switch cases are there thunder operators are there okay so suggestion basically consists of three things the first is the if else then we have switch cases then we have territory operators this is what this is okay great now now guys the next thing is Maths for cases so maths is one of the important topic of DAC so before starting BSE we have some mathematical topics like we can do we can say prime numbers then we have factors then we have topics like we can say multiples okay means basic uh gcd and LCM these are some topics which are used in DHA and the other thing is uh bit that we have covered in the later section okay so these are some basic things that are required before starting Pac or with the AC we can say so Maths for DS is another important section for DSA is it clear Fibonacci knowing these concept is important but no Fibonacci something which is in recursion I can say modular series everything yeah that's all okay I'm just giving you an example okay great now next next thing next we have functions and recursion so because guys we will see what we have inside a inside a program so inside of inside a C plus plus Java python any one of the program we have only two things the first thing is data members data members means in index we have we have variables now like we have int age is equal to 20 your age then we have a string name is equal to your name abhinav so we have data members and the second thing that we have is inside a class inside a program can anyone tell me the second thing that we have inside the program first is data members second second is member functions or we can say simple functions so we have two things inside a class so data Members Plus member functions we call it methods also we call they are different names for it this is equal to a class or a program getting so that is why the the knowledge of this is very required okay so then you have to learn about the concepts of functions don't worry guys I will say it is complete recursion to in my LinkedIn okay after that don't worry if you're writing somewhere it's fine but okay I will also say it okay no worries to complete now the next topic guys the next topic is after this obviously arrays Dynamic arrays and I can see with arraysi I will also cover strings because this string is also array of string is also array of characters so now we have arrays and dynamic arrays means like vectors we have arraylist we have vectors this is what called Dynamic timing means the dynamic sized arrays okay so this is the next topic that we have to do what is string string is nothing but array of characters foreign thing exactly that's the next important thing you have to do guys getting so you can see till now what we have done so till now you can see that we were at the very basic okay then we have picked uh we have taken our programming language then we have learned a complete syntax of the programming language okay I can close this thing the complete sentence of programming language after that we have done uh the master syntax then we have done maths then we have done function then we have we are at arrays and dynamic arrays okay okay honest things okay now now let's let's move forward to this thing okay so after this arrays and string what we have is okay anyone any suggestions any clue what we can have after strings arrays and string if the screen is blur I think you can use the quality section you can increase the quality of the video because from my side the quality is fine foreign ER is something language specific so we have pointers in C plus plus only but I am talking about every language so pointers will be covered in the basics only for the basics no no no let me tell you let me tell you then it's searching sorting so guys searching sorted is one of the most important topic one of the most important topics so searching sorting basically on arrays and strings okay because we have not learned anything else so searching and sorting is one of the most important topic you all know okay getting so searching like we have different linear search and binuses is it right or not am I right tell me okay so we have linear search we have binary search okay then we have sorted here lots of sortings okay we have we have uh merge sort we have Bubble salt we have cooked salt we have lots of sorting then you have to cover this this is the next important thing for it okay now we have searching and sorting you have to prepare it okay after that after that the next thing we have is 2D and 3D arrays so it's something which is just the advanced version of arrays okay that will not take you much time a 2d 3D edition Matrix we can say that's the another important thing okay okay that we have guys I have not added one thing here which is complexity analysis so I think that complex channels is something which should be done at this level okay which is called uh basically in the start level only so before starting learning the essay in maps only you have to also include one thing called complexity analysis complex analysis means how you can find time complexity space complexities type of things okay so that's the next thing that you have to do okay great getting fine so that is including the maths you can say you can include in the maths okay now guys after this you can see we are hashing so hashing is uh something like Maps we have Maps we have dictionaries okay that is what hashing is so housing is one of the important topic because housing is implemented in different algorithms also okay no time complexity in in general basically so if you will learn time and space complexity and start only when you are learning maths so then while you will be gold means when you will learn arrays you will understand when you will learn when you will learn searching sorting you will learn the time complexity of it so as you will go on time and space complexity will go with you no worries okay great guys okay so this is what hashing is hashing is another important topic okay now the next is something very interesting now here comes the greedy algorithms greedy means they are the one of the easier algorithm that you have okay housing is something we have key value pair uh Nikita I cannot explain one but yeah we have a key value pair okay that's what hessing is like we have Maps we have uh dictionaries like that okay now guys after this this is the end of level two level one sorry okay this is the end of level one so the end you can what you get you can learn some specific common algorithms so I've given you some basic idea of it like we have two pointers application is used I use the applications of Hastings like if you have to store the index corresponding to a particular number and then you have to sort according to the key so it plays an important role okay exactly hashing is used in blockchain not exactly but yeah uh blockchain is something we can say Advanced version of it the basic idea of it okay now guys we have this thing like we have uh two pointer sliding window chronic algorithm so this is what we we can say it is okay and now we can see uh in Greedy we I will also cover some other topics like bit menu please so bitmap is again zero one zero one zero one zero one that is a bit so we have a complete different topic called bit manipulation bitwise operators okay that's the important topic that's a really important topic okay okay bit manipulation and sub array subsequence problems are also important like uh find a sub Arabic this specific some find a sub array with maximum that's what canals algorithm is so this is what it is okay this is what it is getting guys okay so guys that is what that is what our level one was so this was the other one pick up programming language Master the syntax and Basics maths functions arrays strings searching sorting 2D arrays hashing then retail columns this is what you have to cover in two months and maximum three months not more than that and if you are in your final year or a pre-final year means you don't have much time then you have to even complete this thing in one month only that depends how much time you are having that depends on you okay so guys this was the level one how was it how was the government and how many of you are currently level one tell me thank you foreign I will save the slides I will share the slides okay foreign [Music] now let's start with level two okay are you good to go to four level two so level one is completed yeah Vishal so I'm not talking about the c c p thing it's complete DSA roadmap that's why I have not taken a CP but yesterday we will discuss CP to maybe in the upcoming sessions thank you so now as I told as I have told you already in the last class that it's not all about practice learning if I'm telling you that you have to cover these topics that automatically means that you have to also practice them as I told you yesterday that there's a 2080 rule in DSC a 2080 rule 20 percent is just the theory and 80 percent practicing okay great so now let's start with the with the level two now we have the level two if it is blur if it is blur you can check out the quality of the video because from my side the quilt is good a which platform to practice I will cover in the last book you can see here the level 4 is practice and when I will raise the level four I will tell you everything how you can practice don't worry everything okay great so let's see level number two uh so guys level number two is uh doesn't have many topics the topics are less but they are more difficult than level number one that is why I have taken less topics and more time okay so you can see here that this is the level number two uh now the first thing that we have practice level one you can see here I have the first thing is before starting level to have already written practice level one and not just practice it before level two it's like practice simultaneously with level two so while you are learning level two topics you have to practice level one simultaneously don't leave it no you don't have to forget them you have to practice them simultaneously that's the first point okay that's the first and the most important point for the level number two fine okay the practice level one now exactly to go on level two yeah we have to first complete level one exactly because the applications are used actually okay okay now guys in level two the first topic which we have a linked list so link is another very important topic which is asks a lot in interviews okay so this is our first topic itself is linked list okay now so why I have introduced link this is the second level because it's something which is different to arrays and different because it contains linking and uh elements are randomly distributed in the memory when you will learn it you will understand so the first topic is linked list that you have to learn okay now guys how you have to practice where you have to practice that I will cover the last don't worry in the last okay first let's discuss what to practice what to learn the complete topic tree okay so yeah the complete linked list type something everything is included in this okay great now guys after linked list after we will complete link this is the next thing that you will have is stack and queues okay the next thing that you have is stack and queues that's the another important thing okay now foreign like the extended version Advanced version of Q is dqm priority but I have taken it differently because that's there are some another uh you can say um some separate Logics are there which are solved by DQ only and there are some standard problems for DQ and priority queue so I have taken it separately other from stack and queue so this is equivalent particles taken uh separately okay so don't don't worry with that uh foreign okay great also guys be attentive in the class reply to each and everything because based on that you will be getting certificates I will send a link tomorrow too okay don't worry so we have stack and queues and we have DQ and priority queue okay uh so means the topic means I have I have not covered sub topics this topic means that everything about the topic okay don't worry now guys and the last not this is the one of the most tough and important topic which will help you a lot I have written here mixed Algos complex and standard problem so what is this what is this so as I told you last year there are some standard problems the problem that can be solved using a specific approach only water mixed alcohols mixed Algos are there are some problems which are solved using two or diff two different logics in Combined let's say there's a problem which can be solved using binary search plus stack let's see there is a problem which can be solved using binary search and stack getting or not so means binary searches from level one stack is from level two there's a mixed algorithm instead getting unknown this is another thing so means it's not like that if you have learned minuses that's not that is why I'm saying that if you are going to level two you have to first complete level one because that's very important there are some mixed algorithms there can be problem uh where we can say where we can say like it's a combination of uh salting and another thing it can be uh hashing plus DQ plus Q there are different algorithms like this there are different problems which can be solved in two or multiple algorithms in a single problem so this is what you have to complete now you will say ask that how we will get this problem I will discuss how you can find a common problem the most important problems uh we'll discuss everything okay great so that's and this this will take a lot this will take a lot of time it will take at least one month to just practice these type of problems just practice getting like there are problems like missing number in Array salt zero one and two array uh or different top view of a trade different problems are there basically which are very much important before going to them so this is not very advanced level I'm not talking about very hard problems no those are the basic problems only but that need to be uh you can say learn in the in a different way okay so this is all about level two so maybe it seems a easy level there are some five topics but no it's even more difficult the reason being it's fine that there are just three topics linked list IQ and productive you and DQ it's fine but this is thing and practicing level and level two simultaneously is a lot so level two is all about practicing level two is all about practicing for pre-final years and final year students I can I will recommend key whatever time I am suggesting for this topic you have to complete that in 60 of it 60 to 70 percent of it means you can see that that this complete roadmap that I am telling you is of one year so for for uh pre-fining you have to complete it within seven to eight months for finally you have to complete within six months or five months so based on which you have to you have to plan your preparation getting that's the thing because you have less time for passed out it based on you that what are you focusing let's see if you're focusing a job after one month oh after one year means you have to complete this DSA in six seven months obviously so it's your target based on your target based on you you have to go listen guys everyone has their different scenario I can't say that you have to devote five hours or six hours no even two hours is sufficient even two hours per day sufficient but in which direction you are working in which direction you are doing the that's that's important but I think that at least two three hours uh or I cannot say party because yeah even I cannot uh give these time at least this much of per day we have lots of other works also like college and everything but yeah I can say uh that 10 hours per week 10 to 15 hours okay or 12 to 15 hours per week should be given 10 to 15 hours per week should be given and we can say like 50 hours per month so this much is required okay at least so means you can divide this 12 to 15 hours in differently let's say that if you have if you have college so you have just learned uh one one hour that day when you have college when you don't have college you have holiday in that day you can push up to three hours it depends on you okay in your scenario because everyone has their own scenario okay I cannot uh but yeah dedication and commitment is needed obviously for the questions for those who are having questions we will have our last and the last we will have a 10 minutes of Doubt session don't worry we'll have okay okay great so guys this was all about uh this this one is all about the problems here just to solve problems that's all that's the last step let's solve problems as much as you can explore randomly solve it at the end of the day you will learn something new obviously that helps a lot that helps a lot okay can we move level two completed level two completed I will sell them I will share it in my LinkedIn okay don't worry okay okay so guys level number three uh uh okay where is it so the first thing is dynamic programming basics yeah you will get the whole video okay uh the recording of it don't worry in this YouTube channel itself you will get the recording don't worry so guys the first thing is dynamic programming Basics when I talk about Basics basic means we have some basic dynamic programming problems okay so these are just a basic dynamic programming topics that we have to do yeah the video will be available don't worry okay this is another basic guys you if you want you can take the screen sort of the session and you can post it in your LinkedIn you can tag me you can tag technology and surely I will I will check it and I will connect with you on LinkedIn okay you can take the screenshot of it and after the session you can post it on your LinkedIn uh and you can tag me and you can tag technology with that post and I would love to comment on that and like like that post okay great so yeah so first this uh dynamic programming Basics okay so now after that I will sell the PDF I will say that don't worry let give me some time okay to prepare it I will say it before tomorrow's life okay now guys this is dynamic programming Basics okay now when you have a little basic basically very basic problems the simple few moment IQ and it's just to get the basics the intro to dynamic programming because Dynamic is very huge okay don't worry if you find solving uh learning problems boring you can start with solving the most interesting thing is I can say giving contest start giving contest I have I have covered that thing later okay if you are feeling boring and learning I I basically also feel sometimes boring in learning the topics so just practice problems on that topic and learn while practicing that's the best way okay so guys now we have after Dynamic problem we have topics like graph and after completing graph you can you can solve a topic which is design set which is similar to graph and with graph because I have added tree below it but you can start graph entry parallel okay means first the basics of graph then the basis of tree then you will you can go on simultaneously guys how many likes are there there are 300 viewers and we have how many likes are there let me see we have just 225 legs this is not fair this is not fair please maintain the likes and Views okay please maintain it then we will continue okay okay done hit the like button okay okay great then let's start again so now this is what we have okay now so we have learned so let's say you have learned the basics of graphs basics of tree and then you you can do it simultaneously okay and uh then the the next thing is contests usually have questions of this topic that we don't know if you don't know that question you can skip them and you can try to learn them so that's what that is why contest is there Japanese okay so if you are participating in a contest you have encounter a question which you have not solved earlier so that's the importance of quantity that's the advantage of content that you are getting some new questions which you have not done so try to solve them through Solutions through watching videos so that you can learn some new things from that contest if that is out of your topic means if you are not evil under topic then you can skip that question obviously okay great guys now guys you can see uh yeah let's let's make chat fast okay just guys write one if it is clear write one everyone all of all 288 guys here please write one if everything is clear quickly then it will continue foreign great so now the next thing is that we can have is a tree okay so not three I have taken some three topics parallely so tree binary heaps they all are native to a tree only okay so that is the topics that we have a tree binary tree and heaps okay and uh what you can do you can first learn the basics of all of them and then you can start practicing the problems of them because these are some Advanced topic Guys these heaps and things are quite Advanced so it will take some time okay after this now guys now what I am not now the topics are really tough not a topic that you are learning is off I can say Google level topics which are asking Google like companies Google coordination these companies okay uh so now there are Google level topics Google and the top companies like you guys okay dynamic programming advanced the difficult problems of dynamic program so you have learned the basics already now you have to do difficult how difficult dynamic programming on trees exactly dynamic programming on graph yeah you can get a job here you can get job here you can get a job but not that much means I cannot guarantee our fund to you but you can get a job after this now our topics are there more evil than this topic more it will be difference between static and dynamic static means the problems are means there's nothing called known as static programming first of all okay uh but yeah studies the rest of thing is static greedy is static okay now guys now Advance after that and backtracking so backtracking is also Advanced topic so there are some common problems of backtracking like we have Sudoku solver okay uh we have Sudoku solver we have things like any Queens there are some rat mes these are some basic problems of battery that should be obviously done okay but there are some Advanced topics also that if you want you can do now guys the next the topics below it are the obvious the advanced topics the really Advanced topics are there which will be args and only top companies okay okay great so now here comes the topics like digit DP extended version of DP we have digit DP next we we can have segment trees and binary indictories then we have tries and there are some much other of this also okay so these are the next things that we have so these are the very Advanced topic guys okay that are not that much easy that are Advanced topic getting so that's it and now here you are done with the level number three no not the essay I'm not saying that you are done with DSA you are done with level number three buy them if you want you can skip these Advanced topics and this thing yeah tries are something which is not binary trees means which have more than two children like that now guys is it fine level 3 is completed foreign we can have for internship and in any air is suitable practice level 4 is all about practice practice one month two month till you get the placement you have to practice till the placement till in turn till you are set up with your job you have to practice practice and practice that's all what level four is okay now how you can practice so I will discuss each and everything I will open the different platforms where you can practice but the the different things like you can first of all practice regularly okay consistency levels is very important participant contest so always participate in contest okay we have lead code we have CP contest code forces participate in that that's very important you can even start participating before from level two only you can start participating contest even from another one that's not Urban time okay and then till you have to prepare for interviews you have to do this you have to yeah you can do recent CPS simultaneously I have added some Advanced topics only like if you will see that at the advanced topics work digit DP uh segment trees tries these models and then we have this is a line which is going somewhere else okay so where is this line going where is this line going tell me anyone foreign if you will complete this all so there are some extra things covered guys okay so this is all about DSA they are something extra like you have to compare CS subjects CS core subjects like you have to do dbms CN okay uh we can say operating system oops OS plus some development also based on your interest and then and sometimes they also are system design and that's all but even a single DSA can give you internship and a job also so that's what it is then you can get if you will complete any all these topics if you will complete all these topics you can crack any one of them I can guarantee you yeah oopsis we can say we can say Theory or something like that there is implementation oops can can you can learn uh simultaneously with DSA that's all okay you can see if you will see the complete time uh according to this roadmap which we have taken so the complete time is I can say at least one year is there uh is required basically because if you will see if you will see I have added these multiple topics and it requires at least one okay one year okay great guys great okay now so we are running about time we have last 10 minutes so long let's talk about how you can practice problems okay so let's take example of platform so we all know some platforms so I will not go into CV platforms like uh code Chef or code uh like sorry code server code forces I'll focus on the essay so that means we have uh lead code so for that we have GMG and we have lead code okay so let's open gfg and let's see how you can practice problems there okay and similar for Lead Core also okay great yeah you can focus on hacker ranking but gfg is something which we can start gfg lead code or something which you can start from the very level one to level four okay there is no change to change anything from like that okay so here we have the code service for CPU okay so I have not Technic code set it's for CP I'm talking yeah some maybe cgpa matters when you're in college okay code story is similar to it code student is similar okay that's similar to this you can use anyone I'm not promoting this I'm not promoting any of the platform you can use lead code whatever you want lead codes whatever I practice on this so means I am just telling okay nowadays you can just open a problem stack the problem section okay you can get different problems now guys so let's say that you are with currently learning linked list okay now guys first listen what I am saying okay let's say currently you are learning a linked list okay so if you're learning linked list uh what you have to do so what you have done you have just added the linked list code so you can see that there are so many topics given here so yeah you can do DSA with development no worries there are multiple topics present here so in from that you can simply selected linkage code you can see I have added the linked list I've added it okay that's what you can do now you can see there are 95 problems on linked lists now you will say that sir there are 95 problems of linked list how I can solve these all the 95 problems it is not possible so in that case what you can do is there are the difficulty level also so we also have the here they also have the difficulty level okay so means you can set a difficulty whether you are in which level so you know the four the three levels easy medium hard let's say you are a beginner in linked list and you have to just practice the beginner version so you can just add in the easy topic tag here so now you will have all the problems of linked list which are easy and which are of LinkedIn now maybe you will answer then also we have 43

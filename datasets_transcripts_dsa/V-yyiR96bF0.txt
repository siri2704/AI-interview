let's understand merge sort see merge sort is a divide and conquer technique for example if you want to sort this array you'll have to divide this array into smaller arrays sort those smaller arrays and then you can combine those arrays after sorting it for example if we pass the same array into this function M sort this will call this function recursively with the two halves left and right and this will continue to split that array into smaller arrays until this step now eventually we are calling this merge function with these two arrays this merge function basically combined the arrays and pl it once you're passing the left and right arrays here inside this merge it is checking for the smaller number which one is smaller between left and right then the smaller number is pushed to this result array okay and in the last this array is returned it turns out to be a sorted array so check this example out and try to find out how this merge sort algorithm sorts an array

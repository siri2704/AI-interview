[Music] hello friends welcome back to our channel so in today's session i would like to tell you the importance of data structures and algorithms for a software developer right so if you want to start your career as a software developer then this topic that means the data structures and algorithms is a very very important thing and the interviews for technical roles in some of the tech giant companies top most companies like flipkart facebook amazon google et cetera et cetera will be more focusing on the knowledge of data structures and algorithms of the candidates and the main reason behind this is this dsa that means the data structures and algorithms will improve the problem solving ability of a candidate to a great extent so with the increase in demand for the quality of software engineers automatically the company will be paying really high to hide them so some of the reports say that the average base salary of a software developer in india is somewhere around 9 lakhs to 20 to 30 lakhs per annum and the question is why do the software developer interviews at a tech gain companies will focus on the data structures the answer i have said that is mainly this program solving a problem-solving ability will be improved with the help of this dhc and this is i am getting a lot of request regarding a platform for the practicing the programs so because i have uploaded the concepts of data structures and many of them have referred those data structures videos and they have learned more and many of them were asking about sir uh please provide the platform to practice those programs and do you provide any certification after completion of those videos and do you provide any assessments and internship operating opportunities etc etc so i i am just using the youtube platform to share the knowledge right so i am not having the platform to practice those programs and i i can't give any certification so i'm keep on getting a lot of request regarding these certifications particularly the certification so then i have communicated with the geeksforgeeks team so that they will provide everything which you require so all of you know about these geeks for gigs so this gig for geeks already has a vast collection of tutorials and problems based upon the data structures and algorithms written by some good competitive programmers around the globe and these also have a running and upcoming courses on dsa which can be found on courses tab in geeksforgeeks website so i will give the website in the description section you can please you please visit that and you will be getting an idea about that and the major problems that an individual faces while learning the data structures and algorithm not only the data structures and algorithms any of course with the certification is unaffordable prices so the solution for this is these gigs or gigs will they have designed a number of online courses available to learn uh at a affordable prices and these courses will be mentored by the industry experts who are working in top jain companies right so this git for gigs have come forward with their series on data structures and algorithms which covers everything from basic to advanced and this is a 10 week long online certification program specializing in data structures and algorithms which includes the pre-recorded premium video lectures and the programming questions for practice so this is a solution which you are required right the platform and the programs for practice and you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement more than 200 plus algorithmic coding problems and main key features are well organized tutorials so this certification course includes a well organized tutorials and the premium video lectures given by mr sandeep jain who is the founder and ceo of geeksforgeeks and weekly assessments will be given and the certificate will be given based upon the performance and internship opportunities will be there and these courses are self-paced that means anyone can register any time and any at any time you can start learning the data structures and algorithm from basic to the advanced and in case if you if you wish to attend the live classes with the industry experts uh focused on the dsa or to enhance your coding and the problem solving skills so directly you can refer the geeks classes live so there are live sessions also geeks classes live and also you can check out with the mock interviews and the real time interview experiences for a various software developers on geeksforgeeks practice channel so in that channel you will find all these things mock interviews and the real interview experiences given by the software developers so definitely this will be useful to all so to improve your performance and how to attend the interview so what are the questions you may get from the interviewer so all these things can be known from this geeksforgeeks practice channel right so you can learn all these concepts and you can start dream job hunting by applying to the various companies so for this also they have provided a job portal where you can find a lot of job opportunities so you can visit the geeksforgeeks job portal so there is a portal so everything is here so you can simply register for the course you just complete that course you will get the certificate you will be practicing more number of programs that definitely improve your problem solving skills right and i have gone through about this course so the questions the tutorials are very good and the questions the practicing questions are very good and definitely they will be helpful for you if you are really interested in data structures and algorithms right so visit the geeksforgeeks website so i will give the complete link in the description section and if you really want to register for the certification course you can use our channel promo code sandeep so that you will get an additional 10 discount so i have communicated with the geeksforgeeks team so they have given this promo code to get additional 10 discount for this online certification course right so i will give the promo code and the website link and the certification link in the description section and if you are really interested definitely go to the link just go through the course details and forward right my suggestion is you just do the certification and you can uh avail the opportunities of all the things that means platform practice internships okay even jobs all these things you will be benefited right so i will give the description i will give the link in the description section so that you can refer and you can proceed so thanks for watching thank you very much

hello everyone in this video i'm going to give you a review of the dsa course on udemy by abdulbari so a lot of people have been asking me about this course whether it's worth it or not whether they should take it or not so i'm going to give you an extensive and honest review of this course and the link to the course will be in the description as usual so you can view the course from there and purchase if you like and also there's a limited period discount on this course right now so abdulbari is a very famous personality almost everyone who has done engineering from india at least knows of him and his videos on youtube have helped a lot of people and he has over half a million subscribers on youtube even for me when i was going through my exams in college then i used to refer to his videos to understand the practical like the theory part of dsa not the practical the theory part of dsa so let's see whether his course on udemy is worth it or not especially from a placements point of view okay so a lot of people wanted to know if they're preparing for placements then whether they should take this course or not so let's see whether this course is good from a placements point of view and whether it's worth the price like i said so for any dsa course there's usually three parts there's the theory part let's get the underline out of the way so for any dsa course there's three parts of it there's theory this practical as in the code theory is obviously the theory part like how you're able to visualize the concept of dsa practical is how you're able to code it and how clean the code is explained and all and then there's the problem solving so these three things make up any dsa course right so i'm going to grade this course on the theory part the practical part and the problem-solving part so let's get into it so first is the theory and the theory obviously is top notch i cannot say one bad thing about the theory he has explained everything really really well like even when he's explaining graph obviously he explains everything on a white board so you're able to see how the data structure is connecting you're able to see how everything works how deletion works how insertion works in every data structure you're able to see how the shortest path algorithm is coming so the theory is 100 like the best you can find so theory is pretty much 10 out of 10. there's nothing wrong with theory like i cannot say one bad thing about the theory that's why i would highly suggest to anyone if they're struggling with their college exams if they're struggling with their dsa like course on in their college then they should definitely take this course to help with their college studies so if you are struggling to understand dsa theory wise then this course is the best for you so the theory of this course is pretty much 10 out of 10. coming to the practical like how well the code is because he has also explained code here he'd never explained code in his youtube videos he only explained the theory right but here he has also explained the code using c and c plus this so the code was good obviously but i believe that it could be better because i've seen a lot of implementations and i have seen better implementations of dsa than what he has given but nonetheless whatever implementation he has given he has explained it really really well so practical or the code part let's turn it into like implementation so implementation will be i would say nine by ten and let's say code clarity code clarity would be ten by ten because he has explained his code really well he has explained line by line what is working so code light is 10 by 10 implementation i would give it a 9 out of 10. and he has also explained everything in c which is kind of unnecessary because you only need c plus plus so c i would say is a bit unnecessary although it's obviously not a bad thing to have extra knowledge but you don't need to go through the implementation and see because hardly anyone uses c for dsa mostly people use either java or people use c plus plus so in the practical part of it again the implementation is nine out of ten code clarity is really well he has explained the code really well so before i move on to what is there in problem solving i would like to also mention that there is no dynamic programming in this course he has not gone through dynamic programming or greedy algorithm so that's missing if you want to learn dynamic programming or if you want to be good in dynamic programming then he hasn't really gone through dynamic programming in this course so that is the one thing which kind of bugged me or the one thing which i did not like about this course is that it did not include dynamic programming whatever it had it was good but dynamic programming is not there now coming to the problem solving he has also explained problems so he has explained only the basic problems he hasn't given any good problem so he hasn't explained any uh good problems there's some construction going on in the background so if you hear any noise i apologize about that so coming back to the problem solving like i said said he has explained some basic problems he has not explained great good problems or difficult problems he has explained like the basic problems and he has explained them really well so i would again give it a 9 out of 10. so that brings me back to my main point who should take this course who should not take this course so in a summary the major focus of this course is on the theory part the major focus of this course is to make sure that the student understands the concepts of dsa the student understands how the data structure is working how the algorithm is working so they're able to be comfortable in it the main focus is not on problem solving and like i said dynamic programming is missing so if you are someone who's in first year if you're on someone who's in second year or even third year beginning then you should definitely take this course or if you're someone who wants to learn dsa from scratch then you should definitely take this course but if you're someone who's preparing for placements and don't have a lot of time then this course may not be the best option for you because like i said there's no dynamic programming and the main focus is on theory the course is really well on dsa and it helps you understand dsa to the core however there is less emphasis on problem solving so if you ask me whether you should take this course or not then i would definitely suggest you to take this course but do remember that the main focus of the course is on the dsa it's not on the problem solving with the dsa but it's on the dsa itself and there's no dynamic programming these two things you should keep in mind other than that the course is fantastic the like the way abdulvari teaches is obviously itself is just amazing you can see that from the traffic he gets on his youtube channel so yeah you can definitely take this course but like i said if you are someone who's preparing for placements and don't have a lot of time then this course may not be the best choice for you but you have a lot of time you're in first year second year third year and you have six months one year for placements then definitely you can take this course and like use it for your preparation so that's it guys if you have any doubts if you want to ask me about this course anything or if you want me to give you a suggestion on any course you can just let me know in the comments i'll be sure to get back to you thank you

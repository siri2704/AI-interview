hello all my name is krishak and welcome to my YouTube channel so guys finally our course on complete python with DSA boot camp plus lead code exercise is live and thank you for all the amazing feedbacks that you have specifically given you know I've been seeing people you know they're messaging me in LinkedIn they're messaging me in WhatsApp and all and thank you for all the support uh again our main aim is to probably make this course much more affordable and provide each and everything that is probably required in terms terms of DSA so that you'll be able to crack any product based companies uh the best thing about this particular course is that in this course we have included theoretical intuition practical implementation along with that we have also shown you uh we have taught in such a way that how we can learn data structures considering visualization in mind that is the most important thing so that you'll be able to solve any kind of problems right so let me just talk about this particular course what all things you have and what all things you can expect in the upcoming two months months in this specific course itself so currently you will be able to see uh this course is somewhere around 54 hours total length and here uh I'm including both python python complete boot camp along with DSA so everything that is related to python that will also get uploaded anything that is related to DSA that will also get uploaded so right now 54 hours is a combination of all those things so if I probably go ahead and show you the detail syllabus so here you have getting started with Python programming language python control flow then inbuilt data structures functions in Python flowchart and problem solving then you have inbuilt data structure practice question searching sorting algorithms binary search practices so here lot of practice questions more than 120 plus are there and our plan is to just go ahead and add more 100 plus and those kind of exercises will also be provided with Solutions right so here you have file handling in Python exceptional handling oops then you have recursions recursion array search and sort using recursion recursion with Rings uh time complexities link list link list practice questions Stacks cues trees binary trees binary searry hash Maps graph dynamic programming along with that data visualization many more things has been also uploaded as we go ahead more things more topics related to dynamic programming is going to come up graph is going to come up and we are going to solve multiple questions itself some people had also requested for w link list and all so that is also getting recorded and I think within a week time you should be able to see that particular video so this course is also going to get updated as we go ahead but our main aim is to upload each and everything that is required at least that you should at least know so that you'll be able to crack any product based companies at least the first two rounds where it is really important okay so all those things we are already covering it and the next thing that I really want to talk about is binary like all the practice questions that you'll be able to see this will have um if you probably use udmi right so you'll get this kind of platforms you know and in this platform you'll be able to write the code you'll be able to check the syntax everything over there itself so everything has been included more practice questions has been included and more practice questions is also going to come up so currently you'll be able to see that just in couple of days more than 1500 students has got enrolled and the best thing is that people have liked this so much if I just go ahead and click on rating right now the rating has not got updated but here you can see 44 ratings and all are five star this is the most amazing thing that I've actually seen and we will be working for this thing itself we'll be taking each and every feedback from exercises from Solutions each and everything okay now coming to the next thing the mentors will be myself yes I have some good amount of content with respect to python that is recorded and then we have mang Agarwal who is also a very good amazing Mentor because he cracked multiple product based companies he's an expert in DSA he's an expert even in data science he's having good amount ount of knowledge and you'll be able to see this is all his information that he you have over here he's worked with companies like Goldman stat M tickle o rooms so these are like all product based companies and their DSA was specifically as and that entire experience is put up over here right and uh here you can see and about me I hope everybody knows and I and you all are loving obviously my all the courses that we have specifically launched in youri right so um yeah right now this course fees is just $3.99 you know so let me me do one thing let me just reload it back so this is the coupon code and this coupon code I will go ahead and provide you in the description of this particular video last 2 days left uh for this 399 rupees coupon and again as I

guys uh I've been recording all these udmi courses and we are going to come up with many many any courses with respect to mlops like big data engineer and computer vision so that is the next courses that I'll be coming up but the most important thing is that soon we are also going to start live sessions which will be completely free you know where we are going to talk about the udmi courses whatever queries you have whatever projects we are basically discussing whatever things we are going to do so considering that we are going to include all those particular live sessions and those live session will be available for everyone those who take Udi or do not take Udi right so this is the best thing that we are trying to do and then I'm working out you have to just give me some days I know everybody is really eager to learn many things itself just give us some day because I need to make sure that we have that right kind of platform set for doing each and everything right so I hope uh

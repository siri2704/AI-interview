[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to Fuzzy Programmer I'm super excited about today's video because we're continuing our deep dive into the fundamentals of JavaScript If you're new here we're working our way through the fantastic JavaScript algorithms and data structures curriculum over at Free Code Camp It's an amazing free resource and learning by doing is truly the best way to make these concepts stick In this video we're picking up right where we left off and tackling steps 16 through 25 We'll start with some basic operations on numbers the primitive data types we discussed and then we'll introduce a really important concept arrays You'll learn what they are how to create them and how to work with the data inside them Now the most effective way to learn this stuff is to code along with me So let's make sure you're set up on Free Code Camp First open your web browser and head over to freecodacamp.org If you haven't already I highly recommend signing in or creating a free account This saves your progress which is super helpful Once you're logged in navigate to the curriculum you're looking for for the JavaScript algorithms and data structures certification Inside that certification find the course named Learn Introductory JavaScript by building a pyramid generator That's the one we're following Now the crucial part use the navigation within the course to get to step 16 If you followed along with the last video you might be close already If you're just joining find step 16 in the course map All right got step 16 loaded up in your free code camp editor Perfect Pause the video right here if you need another second to get set up Ready let's dive in Okay looking at step 16 on Free Code Camp In the last video we talked about variables up to step 15 Now from here on we will cover step 16 to step 25 which starts with primitive data types like numbers and then introduces arrays Step 16 with the number data type you can perform mathematical operations like addition Try printing count plus one to the console So just like in math class go ahead type console.log count plus one right into the editor there on free codecam and hit that checker code button See the result awesome Step 17 You can also perform subtraction minus multiplication asterisk and division forward slash Feel free to experiment with the operators and numbers in your console log When you are ready to move on remove the console log Don't just breeze past this This is your chance to play Try count asterisk 2 or count minus 5 Get a feel for how these work directly in the FCC console Once you're comfortable clear that line as instructed Step 18 In programming you will often need to work with lots of data One of the most basic data structures is an array An array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values Arrays are denoted using square brackets Example let array equals Declare a rows variable and assign it an empty array Okay big concept here Think of an array like a list or a container Primitive types like numbers hold one thing Arrays can hold many things Let's create our first one Type let rows equals into the editor and check your code Step 19 When an array holds values or elements those values are separated by commas Example let array equals first second Change a rows declaration to be an array with the strings Naomi Quincy and Camperchon The order is important Remember that strings are case-sensitive Now let's put some data in our array Be careful with the quotes commas spelling and capitalization Update that line in your editor and run the test Step 20 You can access the values inside an array using the index starting from zero for the first value You can access the value using bracket notation such as array zero Use console log and bracket notation to print the first value in your rows array This is key How do we get specific items out using their position or index and remember programmers start counting from zero So the first item is at index zero Go ahead Console log rows zero and see Naomi appear in the console Step 21 Arrays are special in that they are considered mutable This means you can change the value at an index directly Example let array equals 1 2 3 Array 1= 25 console.log array/prints 1 253 Update the third element of your rows array to be the number 10 Then print the rows array to your console Mutable just means changeable We can modify the array after creating it What's the index of the third element remember 0 1 2 so it's index two Type rows 2 equals 10 and then console log rows Check the console See how camperton is replaced by 10 Step 22 Notice how the value inside your rows array has been changed directly This is called mutation Before moving on learn a common array use You can make use of the length property To get the last element of any array you can use the following syntax Array array.length minus one Update your rows two to dynamically access the last element in the rows array Okay This llength property is super useful It tells you how many items are in the array Rows that length would be three right now Why length minus one for the last element because the indices are 0 1 2 but the length is three So the last index is always length minus one This step asks you to update how you referred to rows two before using this dynamic way Modify that line in your code using rows.length minus one instead of the number two The output in the console shouldn't change proving it works Step 23 For now remove your first console log and your rows rows.length minus one assignment Leave the second rows log statement for later Just a bit of cleanup as instructed Delete those specific lines but keep the console at log rows that shows the whole array Step 24 In the last few steps you learned all about working with arrays Take a moment to review Start by declaring a city's variable and initializing it as an array of the strings London New York and Mumbai Then log that variable to the console After logging change the last element of cities to the string Mexico City Then log the city's variable again When done correctly you should see the example output Awesome A little practice challenge This combines what we just learned Create the cities array Log it Then use that city cities.length length minus one trick to change the last element and log it again Pause here give it a try and make sure your console matches the example output shown in step Hit check your code when you think you've got it Step 25 Now you are ready to move on to the next set of array lessons Remove all of your code from the previous step All right simple cleanup step Just clear out the code from step 24 We're prepped for the next topic And that brings us to the end of step 25 Fantastic work following along We covered arithmetic operators and got a really solid introduction to JavaScript arrays Creating them accessing elements by index changing them and using the linked property That's it for today In the next video we will keep building on this foundation and cover another absolutely essential part of JavaScript functions You won't want to miss it If you found this video

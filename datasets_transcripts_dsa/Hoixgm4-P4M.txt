today we're going to learn quicksort like merge 
sort quicksort is a recursive algorithm however   when you think of quicksort I want you to think 
of the word pivot a pivot is simply one of the   items in the array that means the following three 
conditions after we sorted it first the pivot is   in its correct position in the final sorted array 
this means that all items to the left are smaller   and all items to the right are larger let's look 
at an example we're asked to sort the following   array let's choose a pivot I'll explain the 
best way to do this later but for now let's   just choose three first we move the pivot to 
the end of the array to get it out of our way next we're going to look for two items 
item from left which is the first item   starting from the left that is larger 
than our pivot second item from right   which is the first item starting from 
the right that is smaller than our pivot starting at two we can see 
that six is item from left now starting at the right we 
see that one is item from right let's swap item from left with item from right we repeat the process this time five is 
item from left and zero is item from right again we swap the two one more time this time we see that item from   left has a greater index than item 
from right so we know we're done we swap item from left with our pivot three our pivot is now in its correct 
spot to prove it let's review our three   conditions as you can see all items to the 
left are smaller and all items to the right   are larger we said quicksort is recursive 
let's go through the process one more time   with the larger partition we just made we'll 
choose 7 as our pivot and move it to the end I'll let you watch without voiceover you now we have three and seven 
in their correct positions I   think you understand the concept so 
we'll let recursion handle the rest one important question is how do we choose 
the pivot this makes a large difference in   the performance of the algorithm as we want 
to choose a pivot that divides the array in   half or as close as possible to even out the 
work one popular method is called meeting of   three in this method we look at the first 
middle and last elements of the array   we sort them properly and choose the 
middle item as our pivot we're making   the guess that the middle of these three 
items could be close to the median of the   entire array and as you can see it's not too 
far off here's the pseudocode for quicksort quicksort has the worst case time 
complexity a Big O of N squared   but if a pivot is chosen properly it can 
be shown to have an average case of Big   O and log N thank you for watching please

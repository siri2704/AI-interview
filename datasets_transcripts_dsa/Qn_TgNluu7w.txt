so this is October and in next 3 to 4 months that is January to February the companies will start to hire again for the freshes but is it enough to prepare 90 days that is 3 months for a placement preparation the answer is possibly yes if you follow this video properly so if you ask me is it possible to complete an interview preparation within 3 months my possible answer is no before 2 years but right now with the help of AI you you can actually prepare even more easier and quicker than you think now the second frequent most question which I get is what is the maximum salary I can get as a fresher or a minimum salary I can get as a fresher the answer is it depends upon you so I would suggest you to start prepairing in this 3 months and aim at least 15 LPA so that at the worst case you can land up to 8 to 9 LPA if you target for 7 to 8 LPA then you will be probably ending up in 3 to 4 LPA which will not satisfy you okay now coming to the main context what you have to prepare exactly next 90 days to land in a high paying job before directly jumping into the video you should have some prerequisites that is having a basic knowledge of programming you don't have to be a master in programming but you should have some basic prerequisites and basic knowledge about coding in order to learn in next 90 days also you should have focus and the interest and you should not get distracted raed because learning programming and trying to prepare for placement preparation will distract you will make you Bor but trust me you should go through all the 90 days and abide your calendar which will actually help you to land in your dream job directly jumping into the video the first month and second month are very important you would have listened to your friends that bro just skip this basic just go for advanced topics please don't do that I did and I got rejected in my first interview just because I don't know Basics despite I have cleared all the three rounds and that is the 10 LPA job in 2019 or 2020 so focus on DSA from the first month and the basic algorithms as well but where should I find the questions and where should I find the preparation meal of DSA don't worry I have given a complete DSA question and answers in the caption you can access that PDF completely for free so try to solve at least five DSA questions in various amount of online websites like lead code hacker R hacker Earth there are free platforms which you can practice completely for free at least five questions every day also one learning theory and solving five questions every day will not help you to the next process what you have to do is you should start working on projects take small projects and start with that you can find lot of projects in your own field in GitHub it's completely free and I have given few project Links of GitHub portfolios in the caption do check that right away as well now this is important you have to study core CS subjects and also the basics dedicate 2 days for objectoriented programming and 4 days for database management system and operating system because as I said basic is important and I have given the free resources in my caption for the same so please do check it right now so you have seen what you have to prepare for the first and second month repeat the same process every day so you're going to get strong in DSA basic algorithms and as well as data structures database management system and operating system and objectoriented programming which are all Basics and intermediate now this is month three two main things you have to do here continue practicing DSA every day and take a big project which can actually elevate your resume you have to dedicate at least 10 to 15 days for the big project so make sure that the project is worth enough to elevate your resume now the resume part and the portfolio part the resume should be an ATS friendly resume I have given a free website where you can build your ATS resume in the caption so you can actually check out that and the second one is portfolio portfolio is very important so make sure that you are uploading all the process either in your LinkedIn or in your GitHub so make sure that you have a digital footprint of whatever you have done in past 90 days so you are at the end of your preparation stage so right now you have to focus focus on mock interviews so there are n number of free websites where they conduct mock interviews so what is mock interviews that's a question right don't worry mock interview is nothing but that's a practice interview where the questions are already preloaded so you can attend the mock interviews and test whether you can clear the interview or not so I have embeded few websites which provide free mock interviews in the caption as well so don't forget to check that out by doing all these simple steps whichever I have explained in the video and with the resources which I gave in the caption you can at least get one to two interview calls for sure it's just that you have to prepare that well now this is the best part and the ending part also start applying for the companies even if you don't finish the process I mean the completion of the 90 days I'll tell you why you might think I'm crazy but this will actually help you so you think that you going to get failed it's okay to get failed in the interview but the best part is you are going to get interview experience how the interview will work you know that is a mock interview for you in real life but it will give you the interview experience after 90 days which you are going to attend the actual interview the second last important thing is stay consistent and set realistic goal don't aim for one CR Package 2 CR package as a fresh year and there are lot of influencers out in the market where they promote one CR two CR package you can get as a fresher but all our just fake so only like out of, one people can get it that to they will be having higher level of knowledge if you are one of that person then you can also get it last one is be patient and persistent don't rush yourself to get more job offers the perfect job will land you if you have enough skills and proper training with all the things which I told in the video so I hope this 90 days preparation plan will be very helpful for you so make sure that you

today we're going to learn heapsort let's start 
with some terminology a heap is simply an ordered   binary tree a max-heap has a restriction that 
the value of the parent nodes are greater than   the value of the child nodes here's an example 
of a max-heap we'll make use of a few functions   when running heapsort first we have build max 
heap this creates a max heap from an unsorted   array will also use heapify this is similar to 
build max heap except faster because we assume   part of the array is already sorted you'll 
see what I mean one note for this video I'm   less concerned with you knowing how these methods 
work but rather that they exist and when to use   them once you understand the basics of heap 
sort you'll understand these functions from   their pseudocode let's get started we are the 
following array that were tasked to sort in the   nutshell will continuously create max heaps to 
find the largest item will then remove that item   from the heap and into a sorted partition will 
begin by representing our array as a tree to see   how we did that simply look at the array from 
left to right and the tree from top to bottom now that we have a tree let's create our first   heap we assume this is an unsorted 
array so we call build max heap now that we have our max-heap 
we know the largest item 9 we   swap 9 with the item at the end of the array 1 finally we remove nine from the tree and consider 
it sorted looks good so far except we're back to   having a tree and not a heap this time we call 
heapify since only the item one is out of place one floats down to the bottom and 
the largest number heads to the top we're back to having a max-heap let's swap 
the largest number 8 with the item at the   end of the unsorted part of the array 
2 we remove 8 and consider it sorted again we need our heat back so let's call heapify I think you see the pattern I'll let you 
watch the rest of the video without voice over you we're all done our array is fully sorted 
here's the pseudocode for heapsort the time complexity of heapsort is Big 
O of n log n build max-heap takes o of   n time heapify runs in O of log n time but 
we end up calling it n minus 1 times thank   you for watching if you enjoy the

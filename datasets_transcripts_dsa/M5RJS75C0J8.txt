hi warriors hi warriors hi am I audable guys am I audible can anyone please confirm am I audible hi Shiva hi Subash hi BCube okay okay thank you big hi Alita how are you i am good thanks for joining thanks for joining guys let's wait for 1 2 minutes more yeah thanks thank you bro i am also good let's wait for 2 3 minutes then we'll start today we'll complete basic patterns okay let me show you today's agenda agenda not it's agenda so our today agenda is seen here i hope everyone is able to see my screen see here so we'll solve these patterns this one this one and this one okay and this one as well then we'll move to advanced pattern tomorrow today we have only like half an hour or 45 minutes class so please be focused in that class okay then we'll start from tomorrow advanced pattern and array okay so please share it current watching is seven only just like it if you not just like that series if you not okay just hit like code log sir can you say about the time taken during this lecture It it will be around 40 minutes today it will be around 40 to 45 minutes code logy okay just just wait for one minute more then we'll start from correct 95 okay guys okay where is Vasant vasant are you there no wasn't this not that where are you going my camera where is Anoj okay let's start let's start guys everyone will join and Okay let's start guys today's session okay so yesterday we saw patterns right okay thank you hi Vasant how are you fine bro okay f5 in N you are writing short okay okay let's start let's start guys so yesterday we saw patterns right we saw time complexity as well we saw patterns right and uh v live okay so uh now we'll see now we'll see like some basic pattern today then we'll move to advanced pattern tomorrow and we'll check the array okay so this class will be around for not too much it will be around 30 40 minutes only so please be focused guys please be focused okay please focus guys okay just for give me only 20 30 minutes then we need to solve this patterns okay then we'll move ahead okay so let's start guys without any further delay let's move ahead so see I have this pattern i think all are able to see this let me zoom little bit more let me zoom little bit more yes I think it's okay it's fine only okay so see here we have this basic pattern so first if we got any pattern okay if we got any pattern the first thing what we need to do what we need to do is we need to find the row and column okay that what is the game of pattern pattern is a game of row and column okay pattern is a game of row and column yesterday we saw this okay okay okay yes i also done okay so pattern is a game of row and column so here we need to find row and column okay so see just make one graph whenever you see any pattern okay i for row or we can say just row it let me remove this okay just take your own like notebook as well put row and column guys please draw this diagram in your notebook as well or just let me share you let me share you just take this guys wait I'm No it's not sending okay no problem just draw it like this and uh now just focus here for just 2 minutes so suppose we have this row and column row and column folder okay so what we need to do we need to see first when I see this is the I okay it is going like this this this this and J is like this okay so when I is one see this is which place this is on first place okay this is on first place so when our first element is where when row is one and column is also one okay just see this when row is one and the column is also one in that position our first star is there right okay uh 0 0 blaze like if indexing start from zero or if we are going from one then it's like one one okay and then another one is on two and our J is 1 comma 2 okay because J is on two places right two columns are there okay two columns are there for three 3 1 2a 3 okay for four 1A 2a 3 comma okay see like this we need to make for now for that like loop conditions okay i think your internet connection might be slow because from my side it's showing excellent connection so just like restart or do something okay okay so see here basically if we'll start from the injection from 1 one okay so now we have to what we have to do we have to make the loop condition okay we have to make the loop condition now I'm putting here I think all are able to see this okay now let's make the loop condition for that okay what we need to do we need in SL two loop okay we need to make two loops one is for outer loop and another is for inner loop one is outer loop and another is inner loop okay is that clear clear okay so now I'm going to make that loop okay now I'm going to make loop see here see carefully guys please so that first loop suppose I'm using for loop for from where we need to start that loop from where we need to start that loop we need to start that loop from one okay we saw just now only we saw that table right we remember that table like I and J or we can say row and column then I we draw just now like this two then one or two right so now what we have to do we have to start that loop from one okay we have to start that loop from let i equals to 1 okay so that loop is for row this loop is for row guys this loop is for row okay that outer loop it's not complete cut just hold for a second so this is for we are making this is outer loop okay this is outer loop okay so for now we make one variable I and initialize it with one okay we made one variable I and initialize with one okay now I'm putting that complete condition okay now I am putting the complete condition okay so let's start we have for loop okay we have let I why we are taking let we know all know like in JavaScript like it will not create any error okay if you know JavaScript then till when that loop will go till when that loop will go okay so if user give the length suppose in how many length like how much length that user want for that pattern okay so till there we need to go suppose here how much rows are there 1 2 3 4 F four rows okay so we have to put four here okay we have to put four okay we have to put four here okay we have to put four now it will start from one it will run for 1 2 3 means we need to run this for four as well so just pass equal to just pass equal to guys please do this in your notebook as well and what we need to do just I ++ just I ++ I hope you guys are able to see this let me do like this okay now I think it will be more clear okay so see inside that loop what is this loop this is basically outer loop this is basically outer loop this is for row okay just take a deep breath understand first pattern is a game for row and column battern is a game for row and columns what we need to do we need to identify we need to make one table first we need to see the pattern right when row is one what the column is when row is two what's the column is okay now I made one condition for condition okay here what I did I initialized the i from one why I initialize this from one because why this is one because that I is one means first row okay I is one means first row okay this is first row in first row what we need to print we need to print just one pattern see here what we need to print we need to print just one pattern okay now we need for room we need Okay now what we need to do let me do one thing i think that screen is not visible just two minute guys i think now you guys are able to see okay yeah okay so let's focus again let's focus again sorry for that okay so see here we made one loop outer loop and now we are making inner loop okay now we are making inner loop now we are making inner loop for that so for inner loop either I I will take any variable J or we can say column as well so from where we need to start J we need to start J from one itself because that first element is on one one position or we can say 0 0 if we are start indexing from zero okay now we initialize that J from one now J will go till which position till which coin J will go please tell in comments what will be this condition what will be this condition guys what will be this condition j less than or what psq till I that is correct that is correct till I it will go guys that is correct i hope you guys understand till I it will go i will explain you why and equal to as well and J++ just give me two more minutes just give me two more minutes i will explain you now okay and no no no no it will not go till n because n is five okay yes yes v wasant now it's correct yeah so see here I'm just deleting it and putting again so we have two loop guys we have two row first thing what we need to do we need to find row and columns right we need to make one we need to make one pattern in that okay it is p pattern itself we need to make one pattern like suppose I did take this one i'm just repeating again okay I'm just repeating again so when I is one guys when I is 1 then j also one right when I is 2 J also 1 comma 2 when it is three then it is 1a 2a 3 so see here J is starting from one right j is starting from one as well right see here this is row this is row okay this is column right this is column so this element is on column as well right so J is starting from one okay till when J is going see guys see here please see till when see here at one it is going till one at two it is going till two till three sorry in three it is going till three so J or we can say column is going till that row end okay till that row last element see here see in this example see in this example when I is one let me change when I is 1 then J is also one okay when it is 2 it is 1a 2 it is 3 1 2a 3 4 1 2a 4 sorry 1a 3 okay so see here what's the see this combination okay guys see this combination carefully now what we need to do just we need to console okay now I'm going to make this code okay just open your compiler guys just open your compiler with me okay open your JS compiler any JS if you are using Java just open that okay please open guys please like if you watching this please like today we need to eat 15 like Today we need to 85 like okay just like okay so we need to make two loops right what we need to do we need to make two lives what we need to do just take I am putting for instead of I I'm putting row from is this okay okay I'm initializing row from one okay and suppose Instead of n we have till five we need to print it we need to print it till five okay and row ++ okay guys now how I am making this condition because I know that concept okay just ignore this line for now i will explain it i will explain it just ignore that str line make that second condition make that second condition please in your PC as well guys now for column I am putting column okay column will start from one till what will be the last condition for column it will be go till I it will be go till I guys please focus on this condition please focus on this because this is very very necessary see here this is that done and now what we need to do see if we are if we are using like if we are doing this in C then we need to just print f and after that less than okay but in JavaScript you need to concatenate with that what we need to print we need to print star okay and just put console.log log str okay see here see here guys just what we need to do what I did why I took this string because I just initialized this with empty space and for printing that star for printing these stars we can store anything here we can put hyphen as well we can put zero as well we can put one as well okay it's up to our need then we are just printing that with star let's see it will take any error let's see guys this silly error okay row column initing from one okay column column initing from one then we are just binding this and just we are consoling it okay just open your PC guys please open your PC please open your any compiler just do this part just do this part let me run this let's see see guys see guys this is printing that exact pattern which we are there okay which we are there see here it is printing exact pattern okay it is printing exact pattern see here we have this I means row and we have this columns as well right we have the columns as well we have these columns as well i think everyone is able to see this everyone is able to see this guys see okay so I just already explained little bit I'm explaining again who joined it now so just when I is one this one when it is 2 1 2 3 1 2a 3 so from here we can find that last condition for inner loop okay for inner loop is this clear guys is this clear is your code run is your code running same please put on that poll hi Ankit hi thanks for joining guys two more like we need 13 likes are there two more like we need just like if you are watching this just two more likes we'll hit to that today's target okay just four v what I got just four v what I got please vote if your program is running if your pattern is running otherwise just put no then I will explain you again okay we'll we'll go very slowly slowly okay we need to put that concept here okay we need to put that concept here okay so if anyone not done just press no anoj ano your code is running anoj where is adita aditas anyone then I will tell you that very very easy method for that also okay in JavaScript we have one method repeat repeat method we have okay I will tell you that also this is like like this we'll solve these things okay yes working okay okay let let we move ahead guys okay so this pattern I hope everyone understand it okay let's move for this pattern this is same okay this is same pattern but see here some difference is there right some difference is there let's make a table for that okay let's make a table for that guys now let's make a table for that okay see here I'm just making for table for that this is I this is J okay we know all I or J means I denoting to row and J is column nothing else okay nothing else so I'm just putting here row ignore my writing okay ignore my writing column okay see here care carefully see this guys hey warriors please listen please listen for just one minute see here when row is one okay when row is one what's the column 1 comma 2a 3a 4a 5 see here when row is two what is sorry five I wrote extra dum dum okay okay when is two it's like 1a 2a 3 when it's three it's 1a 2 when it's four it is like one you guess right I think if you like understand that you can guess Okay like this is the reverse right this is the reverse we did okay just now we did that this is exactly the reverse right this is exactly the Now let's code for that let's make the conditions for that okay let's make the conditions okay see here what we need to do we have this like structure right five we have we have four there okay like this okay like this like this we have that structure right now just make Okay see this see this see this okay so when I is 1 and J is there when it is 1 then it is from 1 to 4 2 it's 1 2a 3 when it is three it's 1,2 and when it is four it is only one okay it is only one let's code for that let's code for that okay let's code for that see here I'm putting that outer loop first what we need to do first what we need to do we need to make one outer loop okay what we need to make we need to make outer loop okay what we need to make first thing everyone know what we need to do outer loop outer loop is basically for Outer loop is basically for rows right outer loop is basically for rows then we need to make inner loop inner condition or we can say this is will for column right this will be for column now let's make for that okay let's make for that let's make that condition for that okay see here now I'm putting that loop first condition for rows okay we have for loop just remember that concept just remember that loop here i'm just putting here little bit okay so see from when our I is starting from where our I is starting our I is starting from one right our I is starting from one see 1 2 right our I is starting from one okay let's put like let I = 1 is that clear guys is that clear guys okay okay very good till when I is going I is going same five or we can say four or we can say any number which is given by user right which is given by user and then I ++ then we have to make inner condition this condition is exactly same we did before this condition exactly same we did before there is nothing changing that because same row we need to print right now in column part we have some trick here in column part this is for row guys this is for row now in column part we have some trick here for inner loop we are making that condition from where our J is starting from where like from where the first value from J is starting please tell guys please tell please tell guys please tell guys from which point our J is starting see here see this code see this code carefully tell me what will be that starting condition for J what will be the starting condition for J see this code see this pattern please tell please comment guys please comment please comment anoj four okay anyone guys anyone vasant Vasant just see this code and just compare that previous code okay just tell V was Shiva BQ anyone sutan four wasant is one no wasant why one okay let me explain you let me explain you just give me one more minute okay see here see here again so that J will start it is not starting it is like it is like 1 2a 3a 4 means till when J is going right so we need to start that J from let J is equal to that N or we can say four which number is given by user which number is given by user is that clear guys then till which position it will go it will go to It will go to J guys j less than equal to I j le less than equal to I is that condition is correct just comment me if condition will work it should be less than or it should be greater than just comment me guys just see this pattern draw it in your notebook just tell me rose I that is correct that is correct just draw this in your notebook just tell me is this correct condition Shiva Vasant anyone just draw this in your notebook guys please please make this session interactive Okay okay sa already sent that complete program let me copy that program let me check this we'll check see here civa sent that complete program okay see here guys let me run this if it will work then SA is that warrior for today guys then SA will become the warrior for today guys let me check this let me check this if it will run then okay if it will run then my live will will be successful okay okay so let's see this let's see this j is greater than I right j is greater than I i i will explain you why see here it is working it is working it is working guys it is working shiva your code working siva congrats for that your code is working means my struggle is getting paid off okay so let's understand this concept guys please understand this concept I'm just putting little bit effort in that little bit effort okay see here we have I as well we have J as well right in that first what is happening 1 comma 2a 3a 4a 5 for 2 1 2a 3a 4 for 3 1 2a 3 uh I am explaining basanta I'm explaining for four 1 comma 2 and for five is one so see here please see here when i is 1 just done that okay just try and I think let me remove my face from here i think now everyone is able to see okay yes okay so see here now just dry run that code just dry run means just run this here so in first iteration when I is one when I is one means this is our first condition for row right this is for row right okay this is for row so when it is going inside then we initialize that string as a empty string right do this because in JavaScript we need to concatenate that value okay concatenate that value so J is for inner loop j is for inner loop we came inside it we came inside it now we are starting J from five why see here guys please see here please focus for just 2 minutes okay so we initialize J from five okay and where our code is now see here guys let me put debugger and then I will visualize it then I will provide you i think that will be better that will be better just put just give me one more minute then you can easily understand that thing okay then everyone can easily understand okay I'm just opening my console okay I just opened my console guys okay I'm just putting that code okay I think it is now visible i think it is now visible okay so see here when now I value is one okay then I'm just putting debugger eight and then str having empty string okay str is nothing but for that row okay for that row so see just I'm going ahead now J value is five see here please see here this is block scope okay this is block scope because it is J then in first step J is five okay in first step there is five now what is the value of I i is 1 guys means I is 1 now five is greater than I right means five is greater than one it is coming inside then see here in string first we have empty string please see in screen guys please see in screen in string we have empty string at the first time now I am putting in str that star okay now I'm putting see here in that line string equal to string plus star okay now I'm moving ahead see here that I is J is five at the first time now it is becoming four see it we just putting minus minus okay now we came back here then see guys in that we got two star so why we are putting J from five because we need we need to go till that guys we need to go till that see here we need to go till that condition see here in str now we have five values see in str now we have these values see this is our first row guys this is our first row right isn't it interesting guys you can visualize it directly just copy that code put debugger inspect your browser and put right then you can visualize it you can visualize it okay so now you see here this is for row one this is for row one b cq okay let me run your code as well okay so what will be happen in second iteration now I is became two i became two now we are going ahead now J will go till like only it will like it will uh what I can say in English means last it will like last right okay okay so now see J is five it came inside it it came inside it i is 2 now it will run 5 4 3 2 5 4 3 2 Means that same thing we need to do right the same thing we need to do we need to first print five then four then three then two then one right same thing we need to do right same thing guys please see this same thing what we are doing we are just like extracting a space from here or we can say we are lefting one space from here here one Here two here three here four right so this is basically the J is decreasing right you can see this you can see this J is decreasing okay and I is like constant 1 2 3 4 now let me run that B cube code it is from Java Java compiler okay let me run it congrats congrats BQ congrats your code is running BQ your code is running very very well okay so guys I hope you understand that concept j is increasing right j is decreasing so that's why that loop is there okay so we did this one we done this one okay this one also now just make this i think we already made or not okay just made that condition guys please make this condition see this is the reverse for this guys please see this is we made this we made this what we did here we start I from 1 till 5 we start J from one till till till in the first case till when till when will go it's like I because J will stop on the I position right on I position J will stop okay see here just make this code and send me guys just make this code guys please make this code open your compiler please make this code guys please BQ please make in Java anyone is if you are using Python just make it in Python okay yes please share this channel in your friend circle as well if you have coaching friend just share it just make this guy just like this just visualize it just visualize it i is 1 2 3 4 5 now J is what j is happening here from last 1 2 right not 1 2 we can say from starting like it is five or we can say 4 5 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 right see here this is nothing but just make table guys please make table for that then only you can understand when I is 1 this is like five it is two this is like 4a 5 it is three this is like 3a 4a 5 this is four this is like 2a 3a 4a 5 okay this is five then it is like 1A 2A 3A 4 see this pattern guys please see this pattern now make the condition for that please make the condition just run this code draw this draw this pattern just make two loop one is for outer loop one is for inner loop okay just make two loop just make two loop still I didn't get any solution where is B cube bq please submit where is SA's answer civa is also delay delaying [Music] vasant Anit please run it guys please try run then we need to solve this pattern then we'll over that okay just do it buddy my P par my all warriors just make this in this we will three loops no need no need no need three loops wasn't no need three loops it will done in two loops itself just try to make try to think first make table wasant make table no wasant No need no version no need it will done in two loop itself then I will tell you that JavaScript approach for that okay just make it guys you have to make it make it guys please make it put row and column think it how we can do this okay no one done yet guys bq Shiva Anoj please submit your solution guys please please please no s I'm not telling You need to make just make it by yourself think think it that J is on first step J is five right on second step J is become four five that third step J is becoming 345 just think like that make that condition in your condition current 5 4 3 2 1 is there now in current condition 5 4 3 2 1 is there but what we need to do just reverse it like this [Music] what happened guys what happened no one submitted yet yeah bq done just send the code bq please send that code then we'll check let me in myself now I'm looking that much of big right okay BQ okay BQ done that code guys BQ done that code I think we need to change that warrior name to be cube today java is winning guys java is winning how i will see you something in JavaScript okay just hold your formula we'll solve this loop in one single line guys in one single loop we'll solve this in one single like this first we need to check that code for B cube okay what she is doing here basically so see here in Java as well there is nothing complex right there we are using console log there here here they are using like system.out document okay and for this they using like let me run this let's see guys it having too much errors it having too much errors b cube this showing int i = to 1 you know blah blah blah something okay let me I need to put here main class right i know little bit Javier public mail class like this then we'll put that code inside that might be it will run that just put it like this public class main I told little bit I know okay don't focus that word I just told little bit oh yes yes I know that whole code will not work because now it it will not allow see here guys I'm just putting it i think now it will work let me run it not running who is Java expert again open Java compiler okay madam see yes yes you are correct now I'm just putting your code again and inside it I'm putting let's try now bq done that part guys ankit also sent BQ done that I = 4 4 - I she did that guys she did that ankit also sent one solution ankit just please send the complete solution here not send only one loop please send it complete guys please shiva where is your code okay okay that that code is done guys adita sent that code adita copied from BQ gor of Jen enters in the chat guys gorov Jen enters in the chat let me make me w guys gorov Jen Gorover sir entered in the chat hi Goroser how are you goroser entered in the chat public stating wide main that is absolutely correct that is absolutely correct public static wide main go please run this program in your laptop as well please please run this as well let me copy the JS code yes that is that is absolutely correct gorasan knows Java too much he having almost 20 years of experience guys over 20 years of experience oh this is JavaScript folder i don't this knows more than you i think Ankit we need inner loop outer loop for that here Ankit there is no outer loop for you in your code I'm making okay there is not inner outer loop let Okay no Ankit you run this like we need to just do like this do like this half is in above chat okay okay okay no problem if easily running that is okay okay guys if you not understand it's your problem just now this pattern is coming guys this pattern is coming just see this just see this guy just see this please show check my screen please check my screen we need to sew this pattern we need to make this pattern now I'm just explaining you what we need to do what we need to do guys here please see this see here we have I we have J this we have J guys this pattern printing is very useful for making you ready for that for loop okay not exactly for loop we can say your logic building for how things are going how things are going okay please don't skip that part okay this will not directly ask in your interview but yeah some MNC also can be asked like draw this type of pattern right draw this kind of pattern we saw in the first pattern right or we can say like this these pattern generally ask okay okay so see here I'm just giving you an hint how you can make this how you can make this guys when I and J is there when I is 1 it's like 1a 2a 3a 4a 5 It's 2 1 comma 2a 3 same guys the first loop will same and you need to start j from think from where to where guys simple program very simple program just do just do just try just try guys adita gupta don't send your code buddy you Oh Siva Singh sent his code siva Singh let me take Civas Singh code now okay now I am putting it in JavaScript compiler vasant where are you buddy vasant Okay let me run that Shiva code thank you so much Adita thank you so much thank you so much for your help i'm just running Civa code now guys bq still not submitted her code see guys chin chap dum dum let's see guys what will happen guys please clap please clap his code is working let's I'm taking that ankit code now I am putting ankit code guys I'm putting ankit code now [Music] uh sky is very very well guys Very very well vasant your submission is pending vas was your submission is pending vasant just submit it vasant see here we are starting J from 1 till five we are going static position till static position we need to go 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 right just 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 Okay okay let me copy your code version now so you are saying this is your first condition all right and after that you send this one then this one and this is that let H str okay now then console log okay then console log where we need to put here console log i we need to put here okay now five it will go till n what is n what is n what is n n is five okay n is five or we can say we can just what is this it got freezed okay let me comment this code unit code now n is five okay n is five putting n here here also let's see let's see guys it is showing some error str or something let's see see this is correct this is correct motion this is correct you understand that basic program you all guys you understand that basic program congrats guys very very very very congrats let me take a moment for congrating you i'm putting that marker like this okay and see here guys congratulation guys we did it guys we understand basics of program guys we understand basics of program right in the next lecture we'll show advanced pattern we'll show advanced pattern like like this like this as well right like this not complete circle but we will make some circle okay and uh this congrats guys again congrats congrats congrats congrats congrats congrats okay congrats thank you sir thank you thank you Vasant yeah thank you your understanding as well going day by day up so this is like basic problem okay now we all understand basic use of loop okay this is for that class only guys this is for that class we understand that basic loop then we'll move for the next like simple primate invited primate hollow primate okay then number pramid we'll see that number as well from tomorrow guys we'll start array please listen me please listen me from tomorrow we will starting array okay so please make like please so like watch some videos related to array okay please watch some videos related to array just like revise some concept like push pop okay in JavaScript if you are in Java then revise please revise your Java code okay sir where you guys where is my JavaScript book this is my JavaScript let me show you this is my JavaScript book this one I think you able to see now this is my JavaScript book okay this is from Philip Ekerman okay yesterday I not shown any book i think this one only yeah this one only yeah this one okay so this is the book just revise the concept okay flip card this book is available yes it will be available in Flipkart Amazon everywhere okay okay so this is it guys for today's video this is it okay we did we did it guys very very congratulation very very congratulation okay so please please please I'm putting again please understand arrays in by yourself as well i will cover some point of arrays okay i will cover some point of arrays then we'll start guys we'll start too much things like we will solve like 30 or 40 questions 40 plus questions in that area itself from lead code from or we can say from geeks for geeks okay so thank you so much guys just make that like 20 if possible and share the channel with your friend as well okay share your channel currently we have 125 subscriber on here see this see this we have only 125 subscriber here just make it 1,000

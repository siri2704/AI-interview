yeah I can't figure out this code what's going on man this interview is asking me to create a binary search tree and find the max depth what is that look if you want to find max depth we need to return zero if the node is null then we're going to write an L statement that will add one to our current depth in order to reverse one level then we're going to recursively calculate the depths node children and return the maximum Sun between the node left and node right and that'll give us the max depth what step [Music] aside is is this what I'm going to have to do on the job definitely not definitely not there you go dang yep here you go what what's this that is all the data structures and algorithms you need to focus on to land a job you're welcome oh sick

yes in the last videos we had a very clear discussion about the first chapter which is nothing but algorithms and yeah I mean introduction to algorithms and data structures anyway some small theoretical part is there that we will discuss in the tomorrow's session today we will start sample algorithms and implementations what are the various algorithms that are available and let us see some example programs and we will Implement that we have almost 26 programs are there okay the first program is we need to check whether the given number okay whether the given number is even number or odd number we have to implement a program to check whether the given number is even number or odd number and we have to write a program to find maximum of two numbers okay then I want to implement a program to find maximum of three numbers and we need to implement a program to find maximum of four numbers next and after that we have to implement a program to swap two integer values okay to swap to integer values so next and after that we have to implement a program to find absolute value to find absolute value of the given number okay we have to implement a program to find absolute value of the given number next we need to calculate sum of N natural numbers okay sum of N natural numbers then we have to find out factorial of the given number okay factorial of the given number next and after that we have to see how to extract extracting digits from the given number if you are giving any number how you can able to extract the digits then we have to implement a program to count number of digits present in the given number suppose if you are giving a number like 1 2 3 4 5 how many digits are there in that number five digits are there we have to print that five as the output so next we have to check whether the given digit whether the given digit is existed the whether the given digit is existed in the number or not we have to check okay so next and after that we have to implement a program to reverse the given number okay we have to implement the program to reverse the given number next and after that so we have to implement a program to check whether the given number is pandrum number or not so next and after that we have to implement a program to print number of triling zeros we have to implement a program to print number of triling zeros okay so present in the factorial okay in the factorial of the given number next and after that we have to implement a program we have to implement a program to find x to the power y value so next we have to calculate sum of digits then we have to implement a program to find the sum of even digits so then we have to implement a program to find sum of odd digits then we have to implement a program to find some of prime digits so next and after that we are going to implement prime number prime number application prime number application next and after that we have to find out all the divisors all the divisors of a number okay so next and after that we have to implement a program to check whether the given number is a perfect number or not then even Armstrong number how you can able to check whether the given number is amstrong number or not and how to check whether the given number is a strong number or not okay next and after that we have to talk about fibon fibon sequence okay next we have to implement a program to generate tonoki sequence these are nothing but as a part of fundamentals revision and uh uh the sample algorithms and implementations we are going to discuss about these 26 programs in our sessions one by one okay I think in this already we covered some programs if you remembered which programs we covered already as a part of these I think in the demo sessions if you remember so initially I implemented a program okay I implemented a program to generate a fibon sequence right so how to generate a fibon sequence that total example already we covered sir can I take this program code is nothing but this one already we implemented this this is nothing but a solution for fibon sequence and even I think we discussed about triono sequence also okay so how to generate that triono sequence already we discussed in the last demo sessions of course rest of the programs we have to implement and in addition to this one more program we have implemented so what is that program I think if you see even number or odd number application is there right first program even number or odd number application is there right this application also already we discussed in how many ways we can implement this program almost two ways are there what is the first one by using by using these bitwise operators and second one is by using this arithmetic operators so these things we covered very clearly in our previous session okay so now the remaining things we have to discuss I request everyone to please confirm up to this whatever we covered is it clear for you people guys please confirm yes sir s all the remaining students please give response up to this whatever I covered is it clear right yes sir yes sir right so let us go for remaining programs okay let us go with the remaining programs just please wait for two minutes I will be back right let me continue the remaining programs okay so what is the next program second program already the first program we covered let us go for second program so the second program here is we have to find out maximum of two numbers okay we have to implement a program to find out maximum of two numbers let us see how we can able to implement sir very simple in how many ways we can implement this in the sense there there are three ways are there to implement this program let us see what are those three ways so the first way is nothing but I'm taking the first number like int of input I will ask the user to enter a value I reading the first number then I'm reading the second number int of input so enter B value I'm reading the second number what we have so among these two we have to find out maximum value I'm implementing three functions for this purpose what is the first function first function is taking a comma B and it will return so second function and we have even third function is also there okay let us see what will happen I'm going to Define three functions TF Fu N1 I'm taking a comma B and here we have to check whether is the first number is greater than second number or not if first number is greater than second number we have to return the first number as the biggest okay otherwise I'm going to return second number as the biggest this is nothing but the first approach what we have to find out maximum of two numbers in this case we are taking a value and we are taking B value and by using this um relational operators we are checking is the first value is greater than second value or not if the first value is greater than second value immediately we are printing the result saying a is the biggest number suppose if the condition is not satisfied definitely a is not a biggest number if a is not a biggest number ultimately B is the biggest number what we have and one more thing I'm taking another function function two for the same operation but here I'm going to use relational operators okay here I'm going to use sorry conditional operator what is a conditional operator that we have written a if a is greater than otherwise B you know the syntax of conditional operator first it will it will print the true block when sir if this condition is satisfied so first first it will evaluate this and if it is true it will print this message okay if it is false it will print this message like this we have so this is when it is false and this one is when it is like that we have so this operator is called as what conditional Operator tary Operator so it is the easy statement right when compared with other programming languages if you take Java or C or C++ it will be like this condition question mark true block colon false block something like that but in Python first true block so when we have to print true block if the condition is otherwise we have to go for false block no other special symbols are required to use okay this is nothing nothing but what we have so the another function is I have a predefined function is there okay I'm I'm using some predefined tool for this simply I'm going to return a predefined function is there called Max I'm taking a comma B so what it is going to do it will take these two numbers and it will return maximum of these two in how many ways I implemented this program in three ways we are implementing let us see what will happen if you run the code you'll get clarity let me check so py space test. py I'm taking enter a value 10 enter B value 44 the output what we are getting is 44 in all the cases so I'm giving 10 and I'm giving five so in all cases the first number is the biggest okay this is nothing but a simple program how we can calculate maximum of two numbers so in how many ways we are calculating this three ways one is by using IF and then else second one by using conditional operator and third one is nothing but what by using predefined tools I think you people got very clear idea about this please confirm do you have any doubts up to this whatever we covered no sir clear right yes sir right so let us go for the next program which is nothing but I want to find out maximum of three numbers I want to find out maximum of three numbers sir how to do that is it same like previous program or not the only difference is nothing but we have to read another number let it be so C is equal to enter c value then I'm I'm passing the c as the another argument for this I'm passing that c as the another argument for this now here a comma B comma C so how to check sir is a is greater than or a is greater than b and even we are checking is a is greater than C if both conditions are satisfied a is the biggest so otherwise y if what we have to do a is not a biggest number sir if a is not a biggest number biggest number can be either B or C I'm taking B or C so then what will happen it is going we are going to return b sir when it is going to return B if B is greater than okay so first condition is not satisfied means a is not a biggest okay like that I'm taking then if B is also not a biggest number this condition is also not satisfied then immediately we are going to return like this we have so in the second what we are doing we are taking a comma B comma C same conditions right I want to print a when if a is greater than b and a is greater than C otherwise we have to print B again we have to check one more condition if B is greater than C otherwise we have to print C in the third case we have to use that predefined that predefined function that predefined function can take any number of values no issue at all now if you want you can see we have total how many numbers are there three numbers a b c in the first case we are comparing first number with the second number if it is greater again we are comparing first number with the second number if it is greater then a is the biggest number otherwise we are comparing the value of B and C then the result will be the decision will be taken like this we have okay so let us run this code and cross check whether it is working for biggest of three numbers or not I'm giving inputs like 1 2 3 yes we are getting three since it is the biggest now I'm giving 1 2 minus 3 we are getting two and we are giving 1 - 2 - 3 we are getting one in all these three cases it is working function two is Lambda someone is asking is it a Lambda function no it is not Lambda function it is nothing but a conditional operator in Python okay it is nothing but what conditional operator in Python okay so this is nothing but how you can Implement a program to find maximum of three numbers please confirm is this finding maximum of three numbers is it clear for you people uh yes sir uh sir one small query I have H like in function two you have mentioned like uh else and in function one you have mentioned L if so in conditional function whatever you mentioned do we need do we use else or L if will be will also be fine in in uh conditional operator we don't have that okay so we have to use nested something like this for example if you take we have a true block so when if some condition is satisfied otherwise what we have to do else false block this is the syntax okay in the place of false block if you want you can take again this condition something like nested got it yeah yes sir right so the next one I want to find out maximum of four numbers let us see how how to calculate maximum of four numbers sir it is also same like this right just we have to take another variable D and here we are going to compare the value of a with d if it is true I'm rning a otherwise I will compare the value of B with C at the same time I will compare the value of B with d if B is greater than C and B is greater than D because a is not a biggest number then we are comparing B with the c and B with it if it is greater than b is the biggest number otherwise the biggest number can be either C or D again we have to compare these two if it is true I will print C otherwise we have to print D sir one by one whenever you are increasing the number of elements so even that particular part that length of the program is going to increase number of conditions also going to be increasing why because it is related to the comparisons we have to compare each and every time and in the second function just again complexity is going to increase I want to return a if a is greater than b and a is greater than C and A is greater than D otherwise we have to return B when so if B is greater than C and B is greater than D otherwise again it can be two statements either C or D when it is a c if C is is greater than D when it is D yes you can see here so this is one entire conditional oper okay and in this this is nothing but a true block right this is a true block and what is a false block this is the false block this is the false block false block again is nothing but one conditional operator in this this is nothing but group block which is the false block can I say is it a false block or not yes it is again a nested if so nested conditional operator this is a true block and which is the false block can I say this one yes like that this is a okay this is B this is a c this is a d multiple conditions we are going to use what about the fourth case yes the max function can receive any number of arguments just like this here I'm going to read the value of D from the user okay and we are going to enter the value of D we are passing a comma B comma C comma D here also we are passing like this and here also we are passing like this let us cross check and see what will happen 1 2 3 4 you can see the output is 4 I'm giving 1 2 3 - 4 the output is 3 1 2 - 3 - 4 the output is 2 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 the output is one like that we are getting so I think you people got clear idea how you can calculate maximum of four numbers can you please confirm up to this do you have any doubts friends so I think finding maximum element uh is very clear for you with that you can write minimum number also the only thing is nothing but in the place of greater than you have to take less than other than that nothing are you clear with this please confirm everyone right just a second right let us go for the next program what we have I want to calculate swapping of two integer values let us see how we can able to swap two given integer values how to swap given two integer values very simple sir let us have a look on already I think you know about this spping spping means what interchanging interchanging see I want to read the value of a from the user like in of input enter a value something like this I'm taking and B is equal to int of input and I'm asking enter B value something like this sir I accepted a value and B value I want to call swap one swap one by passing a comma B so what this swap one function is going to do it is going to perform spping of two numbers DF I'm taking swap one function which is taking a comma B and I'm going to print the data in a formated string saying before swapping before swapping the value of a is nothing but a and the value of B is nothing but something like this I'm taking and the same print statement I will use after swapping okay after swapping what will happen sir very simple here how to swap in the sense the first the logic what we have by using temporary variable by using temporary variable we can how to do that temp is equal to a a is equal to b b is equal to Temp like this we can take how this logic is going to work sir let me cross check sir If You observe technically assume the value of a I giving as a one and I'm giving the value of b as a so what is the First Step temp is equal to a so my temp is equal to what is the value of a sir it is one that one I'm assigning to the temporary variable then a is equal to I'm taking I'm copying the value of B what is the B values are two that I copied to a so before performing swapping operation my a value is one and B value is and now a value is occupied with two then B is equal to what is the word that we are using temp in the temp already one is there so now your B value will be updated with one now if you print a and then B what output we are going to get sir two and then one we are going to get sir can I say is it swapping operation performed or not yes you can see the first number and second number got interchanged with each other the first number and second number got interchanged with each other this is nothing but how you can able to do if you want we will run this code and we will check really is swapping is performed or not let me run this code I'm giving the first number as a 10 second number as a 20 are you seeing before swapping a value is a 10 B value is a 20 after swapping a value is a 20 b value is a 10 like that it is doing okay this is nothing but so how you can able to swap two given integer values can you please confirm everyone is the first logic is it clear for you people please confirm guys is the first logic is clear for you people yes sir right sir so there are multiple ways are there to do this let us see what is another example that we another another version so we can Implement these even by using another version swap two I'm taking which will take a comma B values so same format I will copy paste in the second version okay so in the second ver do you know there is one single line statement is there by using by using single line statement we can do that swapping what is that single line statement is a comma B is equal to B comma a like that we can do okay nothing we have to do just a comma B is equal to B comma a automatically it is going to do the spping if you if you're getting confusion you can see I'm giving 100 and 200 before spping is 100 and 200 is coming or not yes after spping is 200 and 300 sorry 200 and 100 coming or not yes this is the way sir how you can able to perform swapping of given two integer values by using which logic second logic I think it is very easy for you to understand nothing is there here please confirm are you clear with this logic friends yes please conf yes sir no doubts right clear sir RTI please don't draw anything on the screen Madam right so next one what is the next next version here we have third version we have total five versions are there so what is the third version swap 3 I'm passing a comma B what this swap 3 function is going to do is Sir here it is going to take a swap 3 okay and before swapping ab and by using okay by using addition and by using addition and subtraction by using addition and subtraction we can do swapping sir how let us see sir please concentrate here okay it is it is somewhat important so a is equal to we can take A+ b b is equal to we can take a minus B A is equal to again we can take a minus B like this we can take so let us see how it is going to work one one example I will show if you are taking a value is equal to 2 and B Val value is equal to 3 okay let us consider my latest value of a is nothing but two and my latest value of B is nothing but three what is the next operation that we are doing a plus b a value and B value I'm adding 2 + 3 which will become five that five I am assigning to the a so your latest value of a will become F sir then what is the next operation a minus B what is the latest value of a five what is the latest value of B3 5 minus 3 will become two that two I assigning to the B it will become two what is the next one a minus B latest value of a is five latest value of B is 2 5 minus 2 will become three that value I'm updating to the a sir have you observed before spping we got 2 three but now we got 32 or not yes this is the way how you can able to implement swapping of two numbers by using third logic in the first logic by using temporary variable I implemented so in the second logic by using single line statement we have implemented in the third logic we have used this addition and subtraction any doubts up to this please confirm any doubts friends no sir is it clear yes sir just a second right sir let us go for another version but I think we didn't executed this let me cross check see I'm giving five and then four you can see before spping 54 after spping we are getting 4 five this is the way how we can able to okay this is nothing but the way how we can able to implement third logic so we have one more logic is there so like swap 4 I'm taking a comma B so what will happen here we are passing a comma B value and we need to swap these two by using another logic what is another logic here we have sir do you know we can perform this spping by using by using multiplication and division yes we can we can use this by using multiplication and division sir how you can able to use in the place of plus I'm taking star in the place of minus we are taking slash we that nothing sir if you want I will demonstrate just have a look once suppose consider the first number is nothing but four second number is nothing but five so what is the output that we are getting before swapping it is four five so after swapping a into b a value and B value got multiplied 5 into 4 will become 20 okay then again we are dividing a by B what is the latest value of a 20 divided by what is the latest value of B 5 20 by 5 will become four right so that will be updated in the B then a by b a value is 20 b value is four latest value 20 by 4 will become five that five I am updating to a so you are going to get five and then four like this we have okay this is nothing but how we can able to Interchange by using fourth logic let us have a look once so I'm giving same example four and five you can see before swapping four and five but after swapping five . 4.0 why we are getting zero because we have used double single slash right which will always perform floating Point result I don't want floating Point result means you can take double slash so that the output what we are getting is nothing but four and five and five and four okay so everyone got Clarity how we can able to perform swapping of two numbers by using this fourth logic any doubts friends up to this whatever I covered no sir no sir no can we use sir instead of multiplication and division can we use Division and multiplication no I think it is not possible because see the simple logic is if you multiply 4 into five okay if you multiply 4 into five and if you divide with any one number either four or five one number will get canceled we will get another number if you divide four with five you'll get zero how you are going to get the next number 0 into r0 by or0 plus nothing will happen right yeah yeah that is the concept okay right let us see the next logic what we have to perform this swapping the next logic is swapping of two numbers so swap five I taking which will take a comma B and let us see what will happen TF swap five I taking which will take a comma B and of course better I will copy paste this function before swapping AB uh by using by using bitwise operators we can by using which operators bitwise by using bitwise operators we can take here I'm taking AAP B again a cap B again a cap B only one instruction only the left side values are going to be changed let us see how it is going to be evaluated and how we are going to get the result okay how it is evaluated and how we are going to get the result we will see now okay so now Here If You observe logically bitwise operators are going to work efficiently when compared with other other operators right bitwise operators are going to work efficiently when compared with other operators that's why keeping that in mind I'm implementing by using bitwise operators so for this you should have a knowledge of binary numbers so consider in this example I'm taking the binary value of nine okay which is nothing but so 84 2 1 like this we have and consider I'm taking seven so sorry B is equal to I'm taking seven which is nothing but 842 1 like this I'm taking now I want to Interchange these two values sir please listen carefully you will get clarity okay just I'm doing updations in the same okay so what I'm doing is I will bring here now please concentrate I will update the values step by step what is the first operation a cap B what is your a value 1 1 B value 0 1 1 1 so 0 1 1 before doing this operation so what is the output sir first time we are getting nine and then seven okay so now one zero which will become because under operations cap operation right what is mean by cap 1 one or 0 is going to result zero so one Z or 0 1 is going to return one now one Z it is going to return one 0 1 it is going to return one 0 1 one one one zero like this we are getting so you are updated a value will become tri10 so next line again we are taking a by B sorry a cap B but in this case the result we are assigning to the B what is the latest value of a tri10 what is the latest value of b sir 01 perform cap operation 0 cap 1 we are going to get one 1 0 0 0 and one so this is nothing but the latest value of b 1 0 1 sir again what we have to do sir we need to perform one more time a cap B now what is the latest value of a 1 1 1 0 what is the latest value of b 1 0 0 1 sir what is the cap operation one cap 1 Z sir one cap 0 1 one cap 0 1 0 cap 1 one like this we are getting which is nothing but a value sir what is its decimal equivalent sir is it seven or not yes what is this decimal equivalent is it nine or not yes after spping we are getting seven n this is nothing but how you can use bitwise operators to perform this operation I think everyone got clarity about this do you have any doubts friends up to this whatever we covered uh sir I have one small doubt in swap 4 like uh is it applicable for zero like one value zero and another values let's like why because in the division we will get arithmetic exception right yeah divided by Z is not possible that's why it won't work for zero okay remaining things it will work even multiplication also it won't work why because you can see that multiplied with any number will become zero so that's why for multiplication and division related operations you can't apply this for the remaining we can do that okay clear got it so let us execute this no cap is not used for addition it is a bitwise operators you should have an idea about operators man otherwise it is very difficult for you to understand let us execute this and check whether is it working or Not by using this fifth logic so I'm giving a value as a n and B value as a seven you can see before swapping 97 after swapping 79 like this we are getting this is nothing but how you can able to perform okay so hope everyone got clarity about this swapping of two numbers clear up to this friends whatever I covered clear yes sir yes sir right sir so with this all the demos got completed okay so from Monday onwards we have our regular classes Monday onwards I will explain from the sixth program okay up to 25 okay and one more thing so in the first unit already we covered about algorithms and even data structures 50% we have seen remaining things I will cover in our regular class don't worry at all and from Monday onwards we will have our regular classes I think the people who registered till now I have given running notes access also you can check in your Google Drive so there is a folder with name dsca with python batch 4 so in that whatever topics we covered in this week the file name is nothing but so DSA python batch for addon addon like this it will be there here you have to verify the topics whatever we covered in the demo classes and whatever topics we are going to cover in the regular classes so from Monday onwards that that thing will be there in this file TSA with python batch 4ore notes you can refer that not notes file okay for getting the clarity because from Monday onwards we will type in that whatever I have taken for you demo source so in that demos whatever I have explained those things will be there in this second F okay so in this we are going to create one more folder with name images topic wise those images also will be uploaded here okay right sir so thank you for attending the demo classes tomorrow and day after tomorrow we don't have any class from Monday we have our regular classes from Monday you are going to get a new link and the timings from Monday is nothing but 7 p.m. you have to join at 700 p.m. okay right sir thank you if you are having any queries you can feel free to ask

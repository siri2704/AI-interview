hi everyone I'm a software engineer at Google I've been getting this question a lot lately that how much time do you need for DSA preparation well if you are a Fang aspirant with no to low coding experience you need to spend 3 to four months dedicatedly on DSA without worrying about resume building or job application while solving a problem if you are stuck for 40 45 minutes even after looking at the hints you need to unblock yourself read the solution understand it and code it go through alternative approach and even read the submissions of other folks to know how it can be done smartly I've mentored the same at scaler and people have got positive results choose any platform of your choice and happy coding

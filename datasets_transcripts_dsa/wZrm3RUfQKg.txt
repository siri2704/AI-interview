[Music] hello and welcome to my channel study with prto so in this video I will discuss week s quiz answers of the course programming data structure and algorithm using python now the first question is given the following permutation of a b c d e f g h i j what is the previous permutation in lexicographic order now write your answer without any blank spaces between letters so to get the answer we have to do one [Music] thing we have to write this program and in place of s we have to write this that is given G ha a DB i c e FG now after uh running this program we you will get this g h a d b f j i e c so copy it from here and this is the answer for question number one now coming to question number two we want to add a function list mean to the class node that implements user defined list such that list mean computes the minimum value in a list of values of type in now an incomplete implementation of list mean is given below now you have to provide expression to put in place of a a tri B and tri C so the answer will be option number c that means Triple A will be none Triple B will be self do value and Triple C will be minimum of self dot value and self dot next list mean so now coming to question number three suppose we add this function fo to the class tree that implements search trees for a name my tree with a value of type tree what would my tree. Foo compute okay okay so this is the program which is given and the answer of this question will be the number of root to Le paths in the tree so after this video If you get some help from this video then please subscribe my channel and press the Bell icon I will upload all the assignment of this course in this channel now for question number four the post order traversal of a binary search tree with integer values produces the following sequence 22 38 28 49 48 58 61 5245 what is the value of the left child of the ru of Tre 28 will be the answer so submit the answer please subscribe my channel thank you for watching this video

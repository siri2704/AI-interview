so while going through the final edit of this video I found something just unbelievable and I I just can't can't believe it that they're not talking about it and Metatron who I who I debunk his debunking in this video as well as Sabian Hustenfelder as well as all these other scientists aren't mentioning this pretty amazing fact that verifies that their SAR tomography technique does in fact work and so I just could not believe it i'm going to present it right now and then go on to the rest of the video okay so this is the Northface corridor called the scanned pyramids northace corridor and the reason is the scan pyramids investigation found this right using interesting techniques by the way this is from history for granite YouTube okay so this thing is basically 9 m long and it's so 2 m high so a person could walk down this corridor in 2 m wide okay so it's not that big but it hasn't been found until recently okay and what's really interesting is they didn't endoscope this thing until 2023 and that's after the scan pyramids group found it okay and it's behind the chevron as you see there those weird chevrons i saw that in the Great Pyramid and I was wondering what those chevrons were i was there in November and I didn't know what that was great pyramid is just unbelievable i mean the accuracy of it and everything so scan pyramids went to this chevron structure went behind that put in all these devices that I think I even saw some of the devices that were in there or remnants of it they had like the computers and such sitting around and they were able to determine that hey there's something behind this weird chevron structure that you can see from the outside of the pyramid and so they basically went and did this paper okay analyzing what's behind these chevrons and they used kind of some interesting new techniques took I think it took even a couple years etc so Muon detectors etc okay so the interesting point is they did all this and released their report in 2023 okay so scam pyramids they're getting all the credit for this because they said "Hey there's something back there why don't we stick an endoscope down this little hole like I don't know why they didn't do that before but so it took these guys basically doing all this analysis non-destructive techniques analysis and then they're like "Okay we'll stick an endoscope down there although these are just tombs don't worry about it." And so this is what they found okay so there's the chevrons they stick this endoscope back there cuz they mapped it and they found that quarter so they called it the Scan Pyramids Northface Quarter right the interesting point is that came out in 2023 okay and to much acclaim and they said "Oh it's amazing amazing scientific work." And and it is and they put the endoscope in there and they confirmed that there is a quarter okay and and it just ends in kind of like a wall here they don't know what's past it but why would you have a quarter that just ends right there okay so that's interesting right great hadn't seen this in 4,500 years amazing good job guys and I cover in this video that just last week 18 March 2025 they made more non-destructive testing techniques so now they combined it with other tests besides the Muan detectors they used uh image fusion i talk about it in the video explain it in depth so keep watching if you're interested in that and basically they confirm that the corridor is there okay great and they confirm that the other techniques work which also furthers the strength of the recent SAR tomography claims but now here's where it gets really interesting okay so this is from look at this paper received 7 October 2020 2020 so 3 years before the scam pyramids report releases this is from the same guys right beyond and Malanga who just released their controversial claims that everyone calls BS Medatron disputes so this article synthetic aperture radar Doppler tomography detects undiscovered highresolution internal structures of the Great Pyramid of Giza and so they're claiming using the same SAR tomography technique that they can look into the Great Pyramid of Giza okay they explain how the technique works they show all the math i already talked about this it's based off Doppler shift of so motion of seismic waves essentially that are on the surface again if you're curious about how this stuff works you can look at my first video links to all my videos on this are in the description okay and here's where my mind just blew okay doing the editing for this video and I can't believe more people aren't talking about it but figure 16 in that report from 2020 okay is a SAR image in magnitude representation of the Great Pyramid of Kufu okay and if you look if we zoom if I zoom in on this what do you see right there you see their chevrons right they're V chevrons and what the f is this is a corridor man there's a corridor right there that comes directly from the chevrons going back as a corridor looks approximately the same size right i mean 2 m by 2 m high roughly and they actually if you read the report it says they can get uh resolution down to a few meters so they draw this in this corridor about the same size that they actually found in 2023 i was just like mind blown you know and if you wonder why there's so much hoopla going on why there was like 700 people at that conference I think it's you know for this reason that I mean they confirmed this corridor was there in about the same size and dimensions you know they show it ending but why would you have a quarter just ending that doesn't make sense so it seems like it it should continue on so if you can use that technology to determine this quarters in there then what are the chances that the rest of this is actually in there that this is what the internals of the Great Pyramids actually looks like cuz we don't really have any clue right ground penetrating radar doesn't go through that rock you know you're not even getting 30 mters of penetration they could barely use GPR on this right and it's it's just not even that big it was like a few meters and that's I explained it again in this video talking about the frequencies so I just had to put that in right at the beginning i mean that is just amazing and I think yeah this technology could work i mean it could work look I if they can prove it here on the Great Pyramid and they can prove it for uh the dam Mosul Dam and at Grand Sasu Laboratory then I think it's amazing so I want to just put this at the beginning of the video and now we'll continue on with uh the rest of the video wow amazing there's been a ton of controversy on the alleged Giza pyramid scan where they could scan underneath the pyramids using SAR temography that would be a new technique and I've got emails saying "Hey you got to check out these videos it's basically been debunking videos made by large YouTubers i got pointed to a video by Metatron he speaks Italian apparently and he makes a a video debunking the claims essentially and we'll go through and show that his argument is just completely wrong actually just not correct." Sabine Hosenfelder also made a video which again is just a ridiculous argument we'll go through that as well and she calls it a 9 out of 10 on her BS meter but as you'll see she says that the the technique could actually work so the science is there but she just doesn't believe it and I'm sure didn't even go through the actual conference at all as well as a new paper just published last week on the original scan pyramids into the Great Pyramid at Giza and it further supports that this technique listening to vibrations in the ground so acoustic Doppler tomography could actually work so thanks for being here let's go through it chris Leato welcome to Lato Files okay this is YouTuber Metatron he has almost a million subscribers and this debunking video has almost a quarter of a million views already so I think most people are referencing this or Sabine Hassenfelder so let's go through and see what he actually says here returning to the technical explanation it tells us that these S the way they're using it are transmitting impulses specifically electromagnetic impulses through the earth in order to receive echoes of the sounds and vibration underneath the ground okay I can tell he probably hasn't ever heard of SAR technology we used it in the fighter world all the time it's a targeting technique and it can see through weather etc but I'm pretty sure if I had to guess it's probably where it actually came from the technology is from military applications so my guess is he's never heard of it or used it before okay but he's going to give some technical explanation on it but he does give a reasonable explanation okay so it is SAR satellites from space which is pretty amazing because it gives them a huge aperture i explain all this in my previous videos you can find those linked in the description but basically what the scientists are arguing is you can get a much better accuracy so sub millimeter they say 01 millimeter Doppler shift and they're listening and getting acoustic changes under the ground because sound travels differently through different materials right so it'll travel faster through solids than it will through liquids than it will through gases and if your material is warmer it'll actually travel faster through warmer material i think that's because you actually the molecules are pushing against each other faster right you have denser energy and so that allows the vibrations to actually travel through it it's wave mechanics and so that's what they're actually doing is they're using electromagnetic waves that they're sending it's active to listen to passive seismic vibrations under the ground and that's their main argument so he does get that correct but now let's talk about the validation of this technique which he talks about on 1 hour 44 minutes in now up to this point I'm not liking the presentation one bit but I want to be fair as you know that's what I always do i love this so he says okay I'm not biased at all up until this point but I'm biased and one of the things that is often used against these gentlemen when it comes to this new technology that they use which of course of course has been seen with a certain level of skepticism is the fact that professional scientists say well you need to test it this tech with other structures to see if it works first and then you should apply it in the under the pyramid but okay and yeah we don't need professional scientists to to tell us this okay so this is just um obvious in today's age we rely too much on profession profal experts right professional scientists if you will and we believe everything they say instead of going and looking at the source data and using our own brains i think if if anything you've watched my channel over the last four years now it is learn please to think for yourselves and don't just take the expert opinions because experts have always been proven in the past to be incorrect they use group think they will believe the paradigm at all costs and they will cast people out that disagree with them right as we've seen and I'll show at the end about cosmology how ridiculous our current cosmological argument is they claim that they did so 1 hour 45 minutes as you see it talks about the tunnels that are in the Grand Sas italia and they say that they were able to use this technology to see correctly pathways and tunnels that we know are there through our topographic mapping okay so this this will honestly be a huge verification of the technique right and we'll we'll ultimately have to see from the final paper it hasn't been released yet is this accurate right could they actually scan into this mountain the Grand Sasu physics laboratory and and the dam that you'll see here in a second and that would be a huge verification of this technology and that would immediately show that it does actually work so that that is correct but let's see how he brushes this off in his debunking as you can see here and here this says analysis of the vibrations and then as the second geoloccation where they tried to use this technology to see if it worked he talks about the dam of Mosul once again making claims that the tunnel that is found inside this dam was in fact correctly identified by their scan methodology okay again yeah huge claim right and this would verify that the technology actually works that the technique works that you can use SAR from space to listen to to acoustical vibrations in the earth because we do do that right we use seismographs that I showed in in the previous video to triangulate where earthquakes start from so we use this previously and you'll see in a further paper that I'll show here in a minute that they actually did it on the on the pyramids backward scan pyramids technique as indicated by this picture as you can see there's this long blue line would correspond exactly to the tunnel that we do find underneath the dam and then as you can see these areas that appear red which I imagine by watching this it means they vibrate more okay and again where he just puts this in where they vibrate more is what he's talking about it's not vibrating more it's how fast the wave is actually traveling through the material that's the difference would be equivalent to the turbines that are found underneath all of this is interesting but the problem with this is that it's still not enough as a in my opinion to justify or even validate the ability of these scans to correctly interpret and receive echoes and data from 648 m underneath the ground in fact 1,200 m as they also claim that they found structures since these do not appear to be scans that occur at the same level below okay so that's his main argument right based on his I'm I don't know if he has a science background or not but he says there in his opinion right this it's not enough to validate or verify that uh they can see actually 1,200 meters under the ground or 648 m under the ground right that's what he says right there and let's hear let's hear his reasoning for this low ground zero as what they claim they have been able to see underneath the pyramids in the Giza plateau and unfortunately when it comes to all of these fannings and areas that were scanned he never provides an altitude he never provides any information that could say yes but we were able to actually find precise scanning say 200 m underground he does not mention one time how deep these scans were able to successfully detect data okay so this is just this just amazing to me and at the beginning Medatron says that he he's fluent in Italian and he watched the whole thing meticulously so that you don't have to right that was his big argument so let's go to the actual conference the time that he that he brought up okay so I'm I'm not fluent in Italian although I did live there for almost three years um I should know a lot more and I should speak Portuguese and I should speak better Spanish but that being said I think you'll be able to see that he clearly states what Metatron says he doesn't right let's check it [Music] out uh okay so yeah I could even understand that italian didn't even need the subtitles basically they applied their technique of synthetic aperture radar phonica he says so acoustic sound if you will to this mountain we'll see in a second okay so he applied it again I could even understand that Italian hopefully you can too if you want to practice they applied the technique to their own national laboratory which is on their national land Grand Sasu Laboratory okay and he says it very clearly right there okay that the physics laboratory is located about 1,400 m of a depth okay he says it clearly right there quattrochinku metress clearly even I could understand okay and he says as measured from the top of the grand sassu so from the large horn of the apex so now I guess we can give Metatron the benefit of the doubt that he's not talking about a slant range like a slant range into the mountain but you have to remember the Grand Sasu Physics Laboratory is a nutrino detection facility among other things I'm guessing and so what they're doing is isolating the nutrino detectors from everything else in the environment right so putting it under as much rock as possible and what they say right there is it's under 1,400 meters of rock clearly so I don't know what else you need to say says he says it clearly right there and if we go to the dam I mean it doesn't say how many meters the tunnel is actually underneath the dam but I'm pretty sure we can find this out open source right it's it's online so I think they're pretty open in what they're stating there and he says very clearly in clear Italian that everyone can hear is 1400 meters under rock and he even gives a a third example which is basically the San Gotardo mountains there's a tunnel system okay inside the mountains that they can also allegedly detect so I I think you can make an argument that these scans are incorrect or that they're not making the correct interpretation of the scans obviously you can't see that it's exactly a spiral staircase and on these eight columns etc i mean I think those are valid arguments that maybe they're interpreting the scans incorrectly but just saying that they don't see 1400 m into the ground when you're obviously biased I think is just a terrible it's a debunking essentially it looks straight like a debunking video so yeah I'd say Metatron's video thanks for sending it to me but it was it's frustrating that he'll get a quarter million views with almost no background never used SAR technology and I'll get like 20 or 30,000 right and I've used SAR technology in the past and have a background in physics and know this stuff and yet anyway gets much more so now let's check out Sabine Hosenfelder's debunking of this i do like most of her videos i think she's needs to be way more critical and still spouts a lot of the BS cosmological models uh that are just ridiculous we'll talk about one comeback I have but she has 1.67 million subscribers and this video has a million views almost a million views in one day so this is a huge video viral and you'll see here kind of um yeah again I dis disagree with a lot of things actually worked why isn't anyone else using it finally the idea that the Egyptians would base a structure as heavy as the pyramids on something resembling pillars seems completely crazy to me let me also add some words on the two guys who've led these studies philippo Byondi previously worked at the department of electronic engineering in Glasgow but no longer works there okay so then she attacks the two guys right so not even the physics i doubt she even read looked at the conference to actually see their actual full proposal i'm sure she didn't um but then she does an attack here saying that yeah this guy doesn't work there and then look what she says to the next guy he's applied for a patent for the technology the other author is Curado Malanga who according to his own website was a university researcher at the department of chemistry and industrial chemistry of the University of Pisa he also has a theory of global alien interference that explains alien abductions as follows quote "The abductee in the bottom right part is programmed using an alien active memory and in the meantime they momentarily take out his soul component the little red ball." So she uses this against him and I watched I was like "Damn man this guy's legit." Like he's got courage man going out there and writing something like that and like no one will even touch the abductee phenomenon right i'm sure there's hundreds maybe thousands of abductees that watch my channel you know who won't even tell their family about it and this dude's out there writing so I was like "Dang man i need I need to try and get this guy on the show." Um so I don't know she she hammers him here saying that this is ridiculous but yeah I think it's awesome man um takes a lot of courage to go and do to do that to write anything about abductees and to propose any proposal for what the experience is about or what that whole abductee thing is going on so let's let's hear how she finishes it in summary this story gets a nine out of 10 on my meter i'm not giving a 10 out of 10 because maybe this Doppler method isn't entirely crazy and just needs more work but I'm pretty sure what they measure is just noise okay so she just said there that she's a a theoretical physicist right which means are you really a physicist or are you theoretically a physicist she says that the physics could work actually but she calls it a BS 9 out of 10 because she thinks it's just noise which we'll we'll see right it it really depends on the verification like I mentioned is if the scan if this technique actually works then we will see it in the future for sure without a doubt because this was found on an Italian satellite and now that it's gone widely across the the whole internet um yeah there's no way anyone's going to be able to suppress this technology if it works so we'll figure that out so my my whole point on this is that not that it's 100% accurate right that there are for sure eight pillars below uh the pyramid and the spiral pathways etc right it could be some weird compression in the rock maybe the weight of all that limestone you know piled up into a pyramid structure makes these kind of uh acoustical pressures under the ground etc but we shouldn't just write off the technology i think going out the door and just saying that this is BS is also the wrong way to do it i'm I'm excited that the technology could work but is there really these eight pillars going down 648 m into these 80 meter boxes it's the hall of ai i mean yeah that's definitely a stretch but if this technology does work I mean imagine what we can do you can scan pyramids all over the place we can look under the ground we can look into Gobecé we can look in the Area 51 right because especially the deserts of Nevada they're very similar right it's going to be these flat hard rock soft you know maybe soft soil deserts but it's not going to be like a city i got one comment saying "Okay well now they can see the tunnels um under Gaza etc." And I think no you know anywhere you're going to have a lot of noise such as from a city a lot of ground traffic cars people walking etc it's going to be very difficult but if you're out in the desert right or you're looking at the Giza plateau where there's pretty much nothing there then I think you are going to be able to scan down into the ground it's going to be pretty amazing like Gobeclet I've been there or Mount Neroot i've been there as well there's nothing out there so I think we if this technology works man it's going to really open up a whole new frontier and looking into um ancient structures or what what's under the ground so I'm really excited about it now this is a very interesting scientific report that just published 18 March 2025 so just last week and this seems to confirm a lot of the tech that they are claiming for the recent scan pyramids so this is in scientific reports confirmation of the scan pyramids north face corridor in the great pyramid of Giza using multimodal image fusion from three non-destructive testing techniques so let's go through what that means so from the abstract while non-destructive testing measurements have been reported individually for archaeological surveys of cultural heritage structures only a few studies to deate to date have attempted to combine these non-destructive testing images by means of image fusion so that's what they're saying is novel in this is they're using older techniques or techniques that have been used before but never before have they been combined into one image so using image fusion so in this article novel multimodal image fusion results from three different non-destructive testing techniques were collected at the Chevron located in the Great Pyramid of Giza that's Kufu's pyramid and I was just there in November it was unbelievable the Great Pyramid really is the real deal that thing's unbelievable the recent scans though were under Coffrey's pyramid and that they called on the tour the Chinese pyramid because it wasn't constructed to nearly the same precision and that's the middle one of the three large pyramids so the chevron that they're talking about is an assembly of limestone blocks located in front of the recently confirmed scan pyramids north face corridor so that's this SP-NFC they keep referring to which had been previously hidden for 4,500 years under the research activities of the scan pyramids mission three profiles located on the chevron were selected to explain multimodal image fusion in detail and highlight its usefulness in archaeology the techniques employed in this study include ground penetrating radar ultrasonic testing and electrical resistivity tomography so ground penetrating radar that has 15 to 30 m range that I covered before ultrasonic testing so this is using sound phonics is what we saw earlier right that they mentioned in the recent pyramid scan and electrical resistivity resistivity say that tomography so basically what they recently did which is the controversial claim is that they combined acoustics with some sort of tomography found through Doppler shift that was the recent claims okay so the chevron is located on the north face of Kufu's pyramid i remember seeing this crazy structure and apparently they focused in on that area and found a large corridor behind it so they talk about ground penetrating radar they say it's been proven reliable technique for blocky structures however the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in this medium is higher compared to continuum structures which limited the p the penetration depth for all the antennas used in particular for the ones with the higher frequencies so they couldn't really use ground penetrating radar that well so they talk about ultrasonic testing in ultrasonic testing elastic waves are emitted into a material and reflected at interfaces between materials the amount of energy reflected at each such boundary is high if the acoustics impedance is different and this is what the Italian researchers are claiming is that different materials transfer sound at different rates and they're able to measure this i think we even saw some of these devices inside the pyramid so there was like these weird devices inside each of the rooms and supposedly they were for some scan i believe it was for pyramid scan and then finally they talk about electrical resistivity tomography and that is a groundbased geohysical technique that employs a current source to investigate the electrical properties of the subsurface so basically they're putting in a small electric current and they're measuring the actual resistivity right so you calculated following ohms law resistance is converted into apparent resistivity by accounting for a geometric factor so think about that they're able to impart a small electrical charge and then measure it to see which materials are inside the structure okay so you have the ground penetrating radar here and you can barely see the the quarter down there and then you have the ultrasonics okay you can see the chevrons pretty clearly there but can't really see a quarter maybe a little mark there and they fused it together and combined the electrical resistivity tomography i can't really tell what that shows but you can still see the chevrons there and they fused it into this final image you can see the chevrons there and now you can clearly see the corridor and so that is the final fused image but even that they say the final fused images should have sufficient contrast to highlight the features of all modalities and be free of artifacts this was used in this study to determine the quality and usefulness of the final fused images and adjust fusion parameters as presented in section 3.5 as necessary okay they said they the final performed step interpretation was using human intelligence progress and artificial intelligence offers opportunities in the future they say okay and then finally using these fused images they are able to actually determine that there is the north face corridor is right in here you see so according to this report they're able to confirm that there was a north face corridor inside that no one had known about for 4,500 years using non-destructive techniques so they're using acoustical vibrations and they're using electrical resistivity as well as ground penetrating radar that they said didn't seem to help that much actually okay and this is the actual scans pyramid north facing corridor that the Italian researchers showed in their Giza conference so according to them they were were also able to detect this corridor in the great pyramid so according to this recent article they say a novel application of multimodal image fusion using measurements from three different non-destructive testing techniques namely ground penetrating radar ultrasonic testing and electrical resistivity tomography taken at a select location of the so-called chevron kufus pyramid is presented the research described highlights new possibilities for improved data visual visualization and interpretation based on these non-destructive testing techniques that are individually already used in the field of archaeology so these these techniques are already being used what they're doing is they're combining it fusing it and now they're able to get even more information and see deeper into these structures they say the addition of electrical resistivity tomography in this study is novel and adds volumetric information which was not previously available the distribution of electrical resistivity allows confidently confirming the presence of the scan pyramids northace corridor so that's an exciting paper using basically similar techniques right using acoustic techniques combined with resistivity how electromagnetic energy sound travels through different materials at different rates and combining that you're able to see into this structure and they found the north face corridor right pretty amazing you also saw there that reading these scans take a takes a little more experience and expertise than just some random dude on the internet and here's where my mind just blew okay doing the editing for this video and I can't believe more people aren't talking about it but figure 16 in that report from 2020 okay is a SAR image in magnitude representation of the Great Pyramid of Kufu okay and if you look if we zoom if I zoom in on this what do you see right there you see their chevrons right they're V chevrons and what the f is this is a corridor man there's a corridor right there that comes directly from the chevrons going back as a corridor looks approximately the same size right i mean 2 m by 2 m high roughly and they actually if you read the report it says they can get uh resolution down to a few meters so they draw this in this corridor about the same size that they actually found in 2023 i was just like mind blown you know and if you wonder why there's so much hoopla going on why there was like 700 people at that conference I think it's you know for this reason that I mean they confirmed this corridor was there in about the same size and dimensions you know they show it ending but why would you have a quarter just ending that doesn't make sense so it seems like it it should continue on okay and finally I think what's happening is we're realizing that our standard models our standard scientific models definitely need a rewrite and an update so what's the chance our current archaeological model is incorrect i'd say it's very high the chance is very high that we are incorrect in our ancient history knowledge i don't think the pyramids were tombs i really don't i was in them they didn't seem like any tomb and we still don't know when they were made or who really made them there's absolutely no records going through all of Egypt so as far as our scientific standard models I think they're obviously wrong in many places and Sabine Hosenfelder is one of those people who calls a critical eye and says "Hey something is wrong." but she will not go and look and challenge the actual fundamental assumptions and here's just one thing I found i'm finishing a book hopefully it'll be publishing this summer and I found really interesting data on our current cosmological model and so this is a brief note on cosmic ages and the great mismatch so check this out so cosmic time scale comparison so the Earth as far as we know is 4.6 billion years old that's probably the best number we have since we're here and we can measure using radioactive dating etc well then it gets kind of interesting because we say that the universe based on our big bang model which if you've watched my channel you know I disagree with this the current model says that the universe is 13.7 billion years old right and people like Brian Green and Sean Carroll Neil deGrasse Tyson talk about how this is some really long time like we can't even imagine 13.7 billion years okay but now what they skip over and they never mention is what is the age of a galaxy how long do galaxies last or live and if you look in our standard cosmological model and this is actually what I found doing my own research is that it's actually 10 the 13 or 10 the 14 years so that's 10 to 100 trillion years which makes sense right if our star lives 10 billion years and red dwarf stars live for trillions of years doesn't it make sense that galaxies could live for many trillions of years i mean just kind of makes sense doesn't it and then if you look at the actual universe what does the standard model say how long the universe will last they say 10 the 100 years that's a Google number so that's 10 with 100 zeros they say that's how long the universe would last meanwhile galaxies last 100 trillion years think about that so imagine we take that and see how ridiculous this number is cosmic calendar comparison so if we compress 10 to 100 years into one calendar year right 365 days you probably heard this before the dinosaurs and how long humanity's been around okay so if we do that with the age of the universe then how far along are we like the current moment right now 13.7 billion years and if you look the current moment is 0.0084 zeros and then a five into the first day right into the first day so that's 4.3 * 10 the - 83 seconds into the year so that's not even a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second that's not even a plank number of a plank number into a second the first second right so basically it's ridiculous so it's just ridiculous to even make the argument that the Earth is 1/4 the age of the entire universe and it's ridiculous to say that the universe is only 13.7 billion years old when in the same model you say that galaxies are 100 trillion years old and that the universe will last 10 to the Google right it it just makes absolutely zero sense it's like having a a million page long book and then saying that oh yeah it started we're just at the first word of the book like it doesn't even make sense it's it's uh it's completely ridiculous and they skip over this they skip over this this fact that in the standard model they say galaxies last tens to 100 trillions years which which does make sense so according to this we haven't even pressed start and we're at the very not even the beginning of the entire universe just shows the anthropologic principle right that we think we're the center of everything and of course we're at the very beginning of the universe and that's ridiculous right and when the JWST looks further back in time they say back in time it's seeing fully formed galaxies right galaxies that can live for 10 to 100 trillion years and yet are fully formed and yet they just started so the the standard model at least of cosmology is ridiculous subian Hosenfelder notes this but still won't go far enough to claim that uh the big bang may be incorrect or we have some fundamental issues and I think the same thing's happening in archaeology and we're going to find through new technology and new techniques and open-minded thinking that maybe there is something under the pyramids at any rate the technology could be valid it certainly looks physically possible and it just seems like the interpretation may be up for debate here but very exciting stuff thank you for watching if you watched my channel for four years I recommend thinking for yourself using critical thinking our science institutions have basically failed us over the last several decades they argue that there's no possible chance of extraterrestrial life no chance of non-human intelligence i think this is all incorrect they say there hasn't been any ancient civilizations right past the Egyptians past 5,000 years and then we we find Gobeclete miraculously and that pushed all the numbers back and they say the universe only started 13.7 billion years ago and I think this is a a ridiculous ridiculous argument if you just look at their own numbers so I think we're at in the information age and over the next few years especially with artificial intelligence and decentralized information flow like

hi everyone uh this is J Manel welcome to another video by the ml Hub in this video we will discuss why you should opt for G D exam so in detail I'll explain what are the scope opportunities and career benefits When you write the gate D exam so firstly what is gate da so gate da stands for gate data science and artificial intelligence exam which gate authorities have introduced uh in 2024 so for the last 2 years they have been taking this exam it is an specialized exam for data science ML and AI rules uh and gate da focuses mainly on maths ML and AI so these are the subjects which are there in gate D syllabus these are the eight subjects we have probability stats linear algebra and calculus and optimization these three are math subjects and these math subjects are uh in mostly all the engineering branches right so G is not just for Gate CA students that's a misconception I'll try to explain in this slide how uh these three math subject constitute around 40 to 50% of gate exam weightage that that's what we have seen in the past 2 years Trends and almost all uh gate uh streams or engineering streams have these subjects like electrical engineering uh electronics engineering mechanical civil almost all major uh engineering streams and even uh BC mathematics students they almost learn all these subjects okay in their curriculum itself so these are mathematics now coming to the next two subjects objects we have programming uh programming data structures and algorithms specifically programming is in Python language so it is one of the most easiest language to learn uh even from scratch so even if you don't know C or C++ you can learn python very easily so programming in Python and then we have DSA and we have dbms so all in all if you want to land a software role anyway right so in any industry if you want to land a software role uh back Engineers or front-end engineer or an ml engineer generally everyone uh who is pursuing a software role or wants to grow career in this direction they have to know DSA right so in interviews DSA will be asked so like students any way prepare for programming and DSA and dbms as well so generally dbms concepts are very core to data science you need to know how to manage data and it's not that difficult okay so like these two subjects get CS students anyway learn in their curriculum and some of these courses are there as a part of your like uh cs11 courses like are part of other engineering streams as well so like these two subjects you need to prepare and then coming to ml and a these two subjects are specific to gate DA they are not there in any other gate streams and these are the subjects you need to master to write gate da so maths programming DSA and dbms and then ML and then General aptitude anyway is covered in all branches and if you want to land any job generally for any inter interview like aptitude aptitude is asked so you need to cover General aptitude as well so this is the syllabus of gate da I would say uh it is a combination of uh different subjects taken from different branches generally any student uh any any engineer okay any anyone who knows maths can opt for gate da these are the subjects okay now coming to why you should write gate da uh or why you should opt for da in general so what we have seen from past few years Trends the demand of data s and AI professionals is skyrocketing like it's increasing a lot uh the AI Market in general is growing a lot and researchers say that like by 2028 AI will create millions of new jobs there are millions of jobs right now and new jobs will also be created so if you see the global AI Market size in billion dollars uh it has grown exponentially from 2022 till 2025 and the projections say that it will keep on growing exponentially till 2032 same goes with the US market this is the US AI Market size in billion dollars it has been increasing since 2022 now how to land one of these AI roles so how can gate da help you uh if you write gate da uh top iits ISC and other premium institutes uh offer mtech and Ms programs in uh AI data science and other related courses and they specifically prefer G da students in those programs so all the Institutes mentioned here either have an Mt AI program or an MS by research program in Ai and very soon we will see that the data science branch in general all the ml AI branch in general you will have ml departments and every of these colleges they are building them right now and they will keep on offering mtech programs uh like in coming years cool so you can you can join these institutes after writing gate D and coming to Industry benefits all the top companies M companies like Google micr oft Amazon and other startups hire Ai and ml Engineers from iits so once you land once you finish your mtech you can directly set for C campus placements or you can pursue the research career as well like whatever you like but all the top companies come to these iits and they are looking for ML Engineers right now and uh what we have seen the data that we gathered for AI and ml roles IIT graduates expect an average package from 18 to 22 lakhs perom for a fresher for an entry level job okay this is slightly higher than normal s roles and specifically for aaml roles the average package is 18 to 22 lakhs perom uh if you do a graduation or postgraduation from iits cool uh now this graph uh shows the median salary of gen professionals which means MLA rules uh across years of experience in India so as you can see as years of experience grow if you have a lot of experience in AI field the median salary is real high uh so like the last data that we showed was from was specifically for I graduates if you do an mtech if you write gate D exam the average package uh for zero experience is 18 to 22 lakhs but in general like across India if you're not even from IIT for AI professionals the median salary uh grows like this okay so this was all about the private sector now coming to the government sector we don't have enough data from the last two years right now psus are hiring from core branches but what we have heard from the individuals who are there in uh psus ke uh many PSS are shifting towards datadriven decision making at just like the private sector okay and they are adopting AI as they can and organizations like drdo isak and other psus uh they have research roles in Ai and they will actively hire g d aspirant uh in the coming future so that's estimate and everyone knows what are the benefits of joining a PSU or a government job uh like they offer job security stability they offer higher salaries and uh they they you there you can also do research oriented work okay so apart from private sector there are a lot of uh public offerings or government offerings as well cool now who should write gate da this is all about the benefits that you get when you write gate da but is gate da really for you how do you check that so this is the checklist you should have a passion for data science AI ML and statistics if you're not able to figure out that right now just think of it like are you good with numbers okay like if you're good with numbers if you're good with math uh GD is for you and you want to study in I ISC or top institutes and then you are looking for high paying AIML jobs in the Private Industry or in the government industry then G is for you all in all like uh again with the interactions with last year's Stoppers what we found out anyone who has a love for maths uh can opt for G da there is no extra prerequisite we will take care of everything else okay so what we have seen from last year's data students from gate CS gate EC electrical engineering civil engineering we have seen toppers from all these branches okay we have seen toppers from all these branches you can go to the playlist called Toppers St in our Channel and see like everyone will have a different background from a different branch some of them were like actually crack GDA in their college third year or final year some of them even like were already working professional in it or other Industries and they wanted to pursue now a career in uh ML and AI related jobs so they then wrote GDA and they cracked it with flying colors so okay so freshers or working professionals anyone okay with a passion in maths can write it even you can take inspiration from GDA a one which uh uh was in Gate de25 he was an mbbs student didn't had a engineering degree and still cracked gate da with the one okay so like take inspiration from all these people don't have the misconception that Gate CA students only write gate da uh gate CS students must write gate da because their curriculum is like almost like overlapping just two subjects are new but other branches students should also opt for gate da this was about who should write gate da now let's focus on on how you can prepare for this exam so to prepare for gate D exam you just need to master maths topics like probability statistics linear algebra and calculus and some of these are already covered in your like plus two preparations as well almost like the cabus alliance to that there are a few advanced concepts added as well then you need to master Mi uh ml Ai and uh DSA and dbms okay so we will help you to prepare all that and if you want to prepare on your own you just need to check the official syllabus and the standard textbooks so there is a video that we created for standard textbooks and explaining the entire syllabus uh we will put put a link in the description of this video as well you can check that out there we have discussed in detail that for every subject to cover every piece of Topic in syllabus which textbook you can refer okay so go check that out and then uh apart from this if you want to take you can opt for online courses and test series as well so online courses help you in structured preparation so that you don't have to like go through the entire textbooks that's very tiring and time-taking process so like to avoid that you can opt for online courses we uh provide a uh gate da course for 2026 and 2027 uh on the ml hub. website uh we will uh put the link in the description and we offer a test series as well again like just taking the course or reading the textbooks won't be enough uh what we heard again from experience from my personal experience and uh previous year ERS that uh practice is as important as learning the concepts from a course okay so do opt for this okay and this is all about preparation and generally preparing alone can be very stressful okay so you can join some study groups study with your friends practice with them we also have a Discord Community with ,000 plus students we will put a link in the description of this video uh they like through the entire journey of preparation we will be with you and other students will be with you so if you have any any doubts if we have time we will answer the question or other students can answer the question in that uh server cool so train learn conquer that's our Moto and you can check out the channel you can subscribe to this channel for more such content and we are putting playlist for subjects on the YouTube channel as well go check that out and like this video and share it with your friends if you think they can crack gate da and this is our website where the course is there so the ml. uh this is uh go on this website to check check uh the gate da courses that we offer thanks [Music] [Music]

I made this website a few years ago to make coding interview prep easier there's 150 questions and they're grouped by topic the first topic is arrays and hashing every single problem here does have a video Solution by the way we start with arrays because they're the most fundamental data structure and hashmaps are probably the second most common data structure we move on to two pointers next is sliding window we move on to the stack data structure it's kind of a subset of an array to be honest then we have binary search which again uses two pointers then we get into linked lists this is the first time you will see a graph data structure in this list they're the simplest form of graph and then we move on to trees which are another kind of graph but they're definitely more complicated keep or priority CU which is actually a relatively simple data structure to use and then backtracking next we have tries kind of a niche data structure and then we get fullon graphs similar to trees and linked lists but definitely more complicated after that we get into some of the more Niche categories you can check this list out on N.O it's a completely free resource I honest to God think that it's going to make your life a lot easier

[Music] hello and welcome to my channel study with pradipto today I will discuss week four programming assignment of the course programming data structures and algorithm using python I already uploaded the week four quid in this channel I will give the link in my description so please go and watch now here in this programming assignment we have to write two python functions as specified below okay now then we have to compile and run so before watching this video subscribe my channel I will provide all the assignment answers of this course in this channel so please do subscribe now in the first function we have a list of annual rainfall recordings of cities each elements in the list is of the form of C comma R where C is the city and R is the annual rainfall of a particular year so by the example we will understand it better that means we have to write one function that is R average which will uh calculate the average of the rainfall suppose here you see uh there is different cities name that is Bombay Madras again Bombay then Bangalore Madras okay now uh for Bombay there is two data given one is is 848 1 is 923 so the average will be 8 85.5 average rainfall which is calculated for B now for madas the average rainfall is 103 + 128 by we will get 115.5 and for Bangalore there is just only the single information of the rainfall now 2011 will be the output now in this case uh for one the value is 2 3 and 1 so the average will be 2 + 3 + 1 that is 6 by 3 so 2.0 now for 2 uh there is only one data that means three so three is there now uh for three there is only one data again so 8.0 is there what so that's the function we have to write now so that's the function we have to write now in the uh function a list in Python can contain nested list now the degree of the nesting did not be uniform for instance 1 2 3 4 5 6 is a valid python list write a python function flatten that takes one uh non empty list and returns a simple list of all the elements in the Ned list okay now from the example we can understand it better that is uh we have to write one function that is flatten and it will take a list and it will give a list which is uh not included flatten uh we have to write a function flatten it will return one list now we know that list means uh the element inside the third bracket or the square bracket in case of python now here what happened in inside the square backet that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this element we have to return and we should not remove this first bracket why because inside the first bracket whatever element present there is not a list that means uh this is not a list the total thing is a list because it is inside the third bracket or the square backet now for this case uh 1 2 3 4 5 6 so this total data that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 inside the backet all are the list that because it is inside one third back but we have to remove each Square braet which is there inside one list why because this is one individual list that means three is one individual list four comma uh list 56 is another list now 5 comma 6 is another list so we have to remove those third brackets or square brackets and we have to return the list now uh to function I write this is the [Music] function define r aage l for data equal to car for CT so this is the function okay now after writing this function you have to click this compile and run [Music] now when you will come here you will see that the all the test cases 6X 6 is passed now you have to submit the code so the code is submitted okay thank you for watching this video please subscribe my channel if you get some help from this video we will see in the next video

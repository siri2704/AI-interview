hello guys welcome back to this channel hope everyone is fine on that note let's start this video so this is week two quiz assignment Solutions so these are completely our probable Solutions guys if there are any changes that come to our notice definitely we will update that in the comment section and if you feel there should be any solution change to be made you can please give your opinion in the comment section guys so valid one so let's see the first question so please watch the video till then because if I make any changes you can be able to note that so do watch full video without skipping first one one of the following 10 statements generates an error which one so we have to give the number so as per my observation 10 statement is the one so I'm giving number 10 as the answer right now let's move on to the second question second one consider the following lines of python curve so they have given the list X as a list so we are making some change for that so they're asking after execution of the above code what will be the respective values of X of 3 y of 1 so you can see here all these are common values here so when I did this in the compiler I have got the option as First Option X of 3 = 723 y of 1 = 43 U of3 = 723 again where W of 1al 357 so first one is the probable solution for second question next moving on to the fourth one guys uh in this video itself I'm going to give the programming assignment solution as well right so third one what is the value of second after executing the following lines so for third question so I will Zoom this for you for your convenience so you have to give the string in the double quotations only so p e o a t l so P ATL so this is the string guys next moving on to the final question what is the value of list one name of the list is list one after the following lines are executed right so for fourth question so give the square brackets as per the rule so 34 comma 23 comma 91 comma 78 comma 23 comma and again 91 comma and the final one is 42 and closing this list with square bracket so this is the answer for fourth question probable solution so friends these are the quiz assignment Solutions now let's move on to the programming assignment Solutions right so this is the week to programming assignment solution so they have given so first code I mean first question second one and third one so we have to give I mean there should be three blocks of code so guys I will show you the code one by one so please note it down so guys this is the code so first code so I'll Zoom this So Def Prime partition of M if should be within this definition block and this return F should be within the if1 next so I will draw this for your convenience oh so it should be like this guys so the second def should be straight to if right so this is the pattern so you can pause the video guys and here this is the final one so here it should be straight to this second definition one right so so I'm going to copy this code now and paste it here here you can Clarity you can get the clarity right so this is the code guys so now I'm going to execute this so click on compile and run button so guys here you can see the status for the first three is passed so actually this code is only for first three test cases so that's why first three are only passed and the remaining are showing runtime error next I will show you the second code and third code individually so if I give all the code within the single frame you may be able to confuse that so you'll get confused so you can ignore this presentation error no problem so it is just a/n extra so no not problem because here it is showing past right pass After ignoring presentation error so it's not a problem now we will show you the next code for the second one as well right so this is the this is the second code guys so I'm copying this I will show you in that comp compiler uh console so I'm pasting the code here so here you can see I'll Zoom this once so this is the code guys so this is the code so you can pause the video if you want now I'm going to click on submit and run so I think it's better if I add next code as well right so please wait so this is the third one guys this is the last code so please follow carefully guys you may get errors if you don't follow the spaces and indentation mainly so this is the last code right now I'm clicking on compile and run button here you can see all the nine test cases are passed right here here it is showing 9 by9 passed right so all of our Solutions I mean all these three codes are correct right and click on finally submit button so here also it is showing all P so friends these are the solutions and programming assignment Solutions and quiz assignment solutions for week two c assignment so hope this video helpful for you if you feel the same Please Subscribe our Channel definitely like the video and please share this with your friends and classmates guys so keep supporting

[Music] hello everyone welcome to coolsoft in this video we are going to talk about how we can find the maximum element of an array so let's get started now what does the question says is that suppose we have an array that consists of 5 elements that is 2 10 5 4 and 9 now clearly the maximum element in these is 10 right now how can we find that using code that we are going to talk in this video so i would request you to pause the video for a minute and try it on your own if you are not able to then please have a look at this video right so this is the logic that we are going to implement in this question so the first step that we have to see is that the maximum value that we are going to find should actually be stored somewhere right so we need a variable for that so first step is declare a variable say max ele and that will store the maximum variable right so the maximum value from the array will be stored in a variable say max ele now first this next step is we need to initialize that variable with the least value possible this is because initialization of a variable is always done with the value that can never be the possible answer so that is why we will initialize it with the minimum value so that all the values in the array should actually be greater than it and we can compare to get the get our maximum value right the third question is so basically we have set up our setup is done we have created a variable now what we will do we will loop through the array from the starting till the end and compare our max early with each one of them so if any variable any value in the array is greater than that max really we will update the max really with that particular value and if the the value of the element or of the array is smaller than max really we will do nothing and by the end of the array the maximum value from the array will actually be stored in the max cle variable right so i hope the logic is clear now let's move to our editor so first let's just declare an array okay so we declare an array like this and if i go by this question only so the values are 2 10 5 4 and 9 this becomes 2 10 5 4 n and 9 great now first thing is we need to declare an array an element that will a variable that will store the max element correct and we need to initialize it with the minimum value possible so we can see that all the values in in this particular case are positive so if i initialize it with minus of one right or maybe minus of thousand then this initialization will actually be correct for this if in any case you are having large negative numbers in the array i would recommend you that you can use int min variable also this actually the int value is basically a value from a standard template and this actually saves the minimum negative value possible in an in an integer right so for now let's just consider minus thousand now our next step is we need to loop through the array right so let's loop through the area from zero till the still n minus one so here there are five elements so we can actually loop till four and inside it what we have to do is we need to compare max element with the element of the array so and if the element of the array is greater than maxil element will actually replace max element with the element of the array so what i mean to say is if a ri is greater than max cle we will just do max cle equals to rri and if that is not the case or maybe the max element is greater than a ri will do nothing so by the end of the loop we'll actually get the maximum value of the array present in max yearly so this variable will actually be storing the maximum value so for checking it we can just output it so if i do c out max cle and some space correct and then end l right and if i save if i just save my code and do build it and you can see the output is 10 okay so we are getting the maximum element through this uh through this code right now i will just show you a dry run of this so that you can understand it better right so we are having these values now initially our max early is having minus thousand value right what we are doing is we are going to the to the array and looping it so basically in this loop first we will get the value 2 then 10 then 5 then 4 and then 9 so talking about the first value that is 2 so if 2 is greater than minus thousand which is true so we will enter inside this if statement then the max elev will will have the value arri so basically now after first step or first iteration the max really is having the value two instead of minus ten thousand minus thousand right now in the second time i will be incremented i will become one so this statement becomes if ar one that is ten is greater than max element now you need to take care that max element has now been changed to 2. so if 10 is greater than 2 which is true our max element will be will will get the value of a rri that is 10 so after second iteration the max ele has been changed to 10 right similarly we will go to the third iteration and we'll pick up arr2 that is 5 and 5 is not greater than 10 so our maxille will not be updated and we will come through the next rotation and similarly till the end you can see that there is no value greater than 10 so at the end of the loop when i will actually reach 4 or you can say i will actually reach 5 and it will come out of the loop the maxille will be having the value 10 because no value other than 10 will be greater than it after maxilli has been set as 10 correct and that is why when we will print it we will get the max element as 10. now small mode tip in this if you want to actually find the minimum element of the array what you actually have to do is just follow the same thing you initialize it with the with the largest value possible so you can actually pick a value of thousand so that all the values that you compare to are actually smaller than that initialization correct and in the loop itself you can actually change it to you can change the sign so basically whenever an element is smaller than the max element it will actually be stored in the max element or for better understanding we can just replace it with main element and this becomes our main element and this again becomes our main element so this will actually this code will actually give us the minimum element if i build it you can see we are getting the value 2. so this is the logic behind max and main element i have written it in the form of like sentences also you can have a look at this also so that's all with this video thanks for

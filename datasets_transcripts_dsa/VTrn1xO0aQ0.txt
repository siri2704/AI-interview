do you want to land a high-paying job at Tech Giant like Google or Microsoft now let's be real these companies are actively searching for employees who truly understand data structures and algorithms why because mastering these Concepts can open the dose to incredible job opportunities and salaries ranging from 14 to 17 lakhs for software developers but the problem with DSA is that many Learners struggle to connect Theory with practice you can watch countless tutorials and read all the blogs you want but when it's time to tackle the real world problems it feels like all the information has vanished so in this video we will understand the fastest way to learn DSA this video won't just cover the common knowledge that's been circulating everywhere instead we will provide you with the straight to the point information to learn and Implement DSA faster but before we begin make sure to subscribe to the channel and hit the Bell icon to never miss any update all right so let's start with the first thing so learning what's important when you are preparing for coding interviews it's crucial to focus on the right areas interviews aren't about knowing everything they are about mastering the key Concepts that companies test you on one of the most important things to grasp is big on notation so why big on notation so big on notation is how you measure the efficiency of your algorithms in an interview it's not enough to get the correct solution you need to know if your solution is optimal that means understanding how your code will perform as the input size grows for example let's say you write a function to sort an array so there are different ways to do this some are fast some are slow so big O helps you figure out which one is best for larger inputs all right now the other thing that is help is optimizing your code so you must learn about it as well because this is also another thing that's important so optimizing your code is another aspect of it so companies want to see that you can write efficient code and inefficient algorithms that works fine on small inputs could completely fail when the input size grows to Millions so by understanding how to analyze the complexity of your code you can optimize it making sure it performs well even in the worst case scenarios when preparing for interviews make sure to prioritize learning about the time complexity so time complexity here is how fast does your algorithm run as the input size increases then the second thing is space complexity it means how much memory does your algorithm use you don't need to know every algorithm out there but you should know the common patterns and how to optimize them mastering the big go is one of the first steps to showing interviewers that you are thinking like an engineer all right so this was about learning what's important now let's talk about an important misconception all right now coming to the next point which is languages doesn't matter in DSA so here's the truth the programming language you use doesn't really matter when it comes to DSA I know I know everyone's always debating python versus C++ versus Java but in the context of data structures and algorithms what actually matters is how you think and how you solve problems DSA is about logic not the syntax whether you write your solution in python or JavaScript it doesn't change the fact that you need to know how to implement a binary tree handle recursion or optimize a sorting algorithm companies don't stick to one language they use whatever text tag suits the project so during interviews they are accessing how well you know the DSA not if you know a specific language so once you have understood that so let's move on to the core topics that the companies focus on that is the high probability of being ask in interviews so when preparing for coding interviews certain data structures almost always come up because they have high probability of asking in interviews so let's break down the ones you are most likely to see first is arrays then link list Stacks cues binary trees and hash tables I know there are more data sees as well but these are the high probability ones which are often asked in interviews so you need to focus on these much more all right starting with the first one which is arrays so an array is one of the most basic data structure it's simply a collection of elements usually stored in a contigous block of memory arrays are great for scenarios where you need to fast access to data using an index now why they are important in interviews so they are often used in sorting and searching problems they help you understand memory management especially in languages like C++ or Java and you will frequently encounter algorithm questions that involve traversing reversing or manipulating arras so yeah they are very important in interviews some of the interviews question that being asked regarding arrays is find the maximum sum of sub array also known as cadan algorithm second one is rotate an array by K positions so these are the just the two examples you can explore some more examples on your own so yeah this was about arrays that is the first data structure that you should focus on coming to the next one which is link list so a link list is a linear data structure again where each element node points to the next one unlike arrays link list are Dynamic and don't don't require a predefined size yes in Array you require a predefined size but in linkless you don't require a predefined size so why they are important in interviews so they are important in interviews because they are used to understand memory allocation pointers and the concept of dynamic structures and Link list are common in problems that require insertion and deltion operations where arrays would be inefficient because arrays require shifting elements all right some of the common interview questions that you can see regarding link list is that reversing a link list pretty basic one then detecting a cycle in a link list also called Floyd cycle detection algorithm so these were the example interview questions that you might face in your interviews but yeah you should have a clear idea about it all right coming to the third one that is the third data structure which is Stacks a stack follows the last in first out that is the lead before principle you can only add or remove elements from the top just like a stack of books or like a pair of Bangles so why they are important so Stacks are used in recursive algorithms and in managing function calls they are also used for problems involving balancing symbols like parenthesis or backtracking like depth for search that is the DFS some of the common interview questions that are asked regarding Stacks are evaluate a postfix expression check for balance parenthesis in an expression so yeah these two are often asked in interviews so you must have an idea about these as well all right coming to the next data structure that has a high probability of being asked in interviews which is Q's so a q follows the first in first out approach that is the fif so just keep in mind in Stacks it follows Leo that is last in first out but in Q it follows first in first out that is fifo so this ffo principle think of it like a line at a bank the first person in the first is served first all right as simple as that like a toll text barrier or something like that you can assume it now why they are important in interviews so cues are widely used in real world scenarios like task scheduling or buffering all right now they're also essential for breath Force search that is BFS algorithms inry or graph reversals which is a pretty you know popular algorithms all right the questions that are being asked in interviews regarding cues are Implement a queue using two stacks and perform a level order traversal of a binary tree so these are the two interview questions that are often asked in interviews there are more again you have to explore some more examples on it and try those all right coming to the next high probability data structure is is binary trees so a binary tree is a hierarchal data structure where each node has at most two children left and right special types of binary trees like binary search tree that is the BST follow specific rules example left child is smaller than the parent right child is larger like that now why they are important in interviews so they are pretty important because they appear in many classic problems from searching and sorting to hierarchial and data representation basically the hierarchial data representation and understanding trees also helps in mastering more complex structures like heaps or tries so yeah this is why binary Tre is very very important all right example interview questions for this one is find the lowest common ancestor that is the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree this is the problem you will often encounter in various platforms that you going to practice DSA that is the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree that is the lowest common ancestor second one is you can say validate if of binary tree is binary search tree that is check if it is BST or not so these two are often asked interv questions all right coming to the next one that is the next DSA which is Hash tables so hash table is another data structure that allows for fast data retrieval based on the key value value pirs so they use a hash function to map keys to indexes in an array as you can see on the screen key value pairs that is zero and the value one is in front of it so now why they are important in interviews so hash tables are used to solve problems requiring quick lookups insertions and Els and they are vital for understanding hashing which is used in everything from databases to cryptography all right now some of the important interview question for this one is find the first non-re repeating character in a string then another one is Implement a hashmap from scratch these are the two interview questions that are being asked so when you're looking at an algorithm ask yourself how does this scale with larger inputs this is where time complexity comes into play in interviews you will be often asked about the performance of specific operations be ready to discuss the time complexities of arrays link list trees and hash tables all right now that you know which data structures are important let's focus on how to learn them effectively so what do focus when diving into any data structure it's essential to take a structured approach to really grasp how they work and their practical applications so first understand how it's represented in code so you will want to look at some actual code examples to see how the data structure is implemented find a good representation in your favorite programming language whether it's python Java or C++ look at how nodes or arrays are set up this will help you visualize what's happening behind the process so next one is learn the key operations so learning the key operations is like getting familiar with the main operations that you can perform on that data structure for example know how to you know insert elements in a structure then delete elements when needed then Traverse the structure to access elements and search for specific items so these are the key operations that you should know make sure to do examples on that so that you can understand and you can see them in action all right okay now finally analyze the time and space complexity all right so this this is the another Point analyzing the time and space complexity so this step is crucial because you should look up the time complexity for each operation you just learned understand how each operation takes especially in the worst case scenarios also get a grasp on the space complexity to know how much memory the structure uses it can be super helpful to find tables or charts that summarize these complexities for quick references all right now coming to the next thing to focus on which is for specific data structures for specific data structures like binary trees start by checking out how nodes are structured in code learn the operations like insertion different ways to Traverse the tree and how to delete nodes and don't forget to familiarize yourself with the average and worst case complexities for those operations next one is Hash tables so look into how keys and values are stored understand the process of inserting searching for and deleting the key value pairs again make sure you know the average and worst case time complexities for these actions after you have gone through the learning phase there is one key step to ensure everything sticks which is keep revising yes you can't just learn DSA once and forget about it it's crucial to keep revisiting the concepts regularly algorithms and data structures are easy to forget if you don't use them frequently especially when it comes to the tricky ones like dynamic programming or graph algorithms so yeah when I say revision I don't just mean going over your noes I mean practicing problems consistently the more you practice the more patterns you will recognize and the quicker you will get at identifying the right approach and you don't need to spend hours every day but even a quick review or solving a problem or two consistently will help you understanding the concept so this this continues revision not only helps you stay prepared for interviews but it also builds long-term confidence in your ability to apply DSA Concepts whenever needed finally there's one more thing that ties everything together that is making a project yes one of the best ways to truly internalize DSA is by applying it to projects this isn't just about practicing isolated problems projects push you to think about how DSA fits into larger and practical applications so when you build something you will encounter real world challenges where the right data structure or algorithm makes all the difference for example implementing a search feature in an app can help you apply binary search or hashmaps while building a task scheduler might make you work with heaps or graphs by using DSA in projects you not only solidify your understanding but also showcase practical skills that companies actually value so it's a great way to learn and demonstrate how DSA is used in the real world applications if you are looking to boost your DSA skills advanced fullstack boot camp by upgrade is the right choice in this course you will learn about important data structures like arrays link list Stacks cues and trees and how to use algorithms for searching sorting and optimizing you will also dive deep into fullstack development working with JavaScript re Jack not JS and whatnot plus you will get career guidance from experienced professionals to help you succeed in the tech world so don't wait click on the link in the description box for more all right to sum it up if you want to learn DSA quickly focus on what really matters get a solid understanding of bigo but don't stress about the programming language the key is to master important topics like arrays link list cues bines and hash tables and make sure you know the time complexity of each one of them when you dive into a new data structure start by learning how it is written in code and the operations it can perform so that was it for this video guys if you like this video don't forget to like share and subscribe

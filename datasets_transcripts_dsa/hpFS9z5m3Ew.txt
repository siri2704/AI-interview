[Music] hi everyone welcome to another PSC video today we are going to discuss a problem named equal sum let's move to the description part it's saying you are given four integer a b c and d if the sum of any two integers is equal to the sum of other two elements then print yes otherwise print no so I think the question self explanatory the input we have a b c and d like here 1 184 and 11 and output will be like yes if we have a pair of some of a pair of integers where sum is equal to the some of other pair of integers like here 8 + 4 is equ to 11 + 1 which is 12 okay similarly it is written here also 1 + 11 = to 12 which is equals to 8 + 4 12 okay then yes and now from here also in this case uh no pair have sum equals to other half other two some of other two integers okay so that's why printed no so let's addite the gens first for integers are given a b c and d and we need to find if the sum of any two integers if the sum of any two integers is equal to sum of the other two okay so if it is then return Yes otherwise return no now let's move to the approach the approach we are going to discuss here is going to be the Brute Force approach I mean there are other efficient or optimized approaches but right now we are going to discuss the Brute Force only okay so what is that uh if we have four integers a b c and d okay and in order to return yes as an answer one pair among all the possible pairs okay one pair among all the possible pairs of two integers among a b c and d must have sum of pair equals to Total sum divid by two that's how the sum of two integers will divide the toal sum into two equal halves right that's how if some of two integers are divid the total sum into equal halves then the sum of other two integers will give will be equal to the first two okay like if a + b is equals to Total sumide by 2 means that C + D is also equals to Total sum divid 2 okay that's the only way okay so that makes the sum of other two integers equals divid by two okay that's what I have written earlier so now let's see if toal sum equals to A + B + C + D then what are we going to do we need to check the sum of all possible pirs because we don't know which two element are going to give that kind of sum okay so we are going to check all the possible pirs uh here it is it can be done because we have only four integers okay so out of four integers uh uh the number of pairs uh having two integers only as going to be equal to six only okay I will show you that is among a b c and d f what is the p is possible AB a a d BC so if b d c and d so if some of any of these pairs now is equals to Total sum divid by two then we are going to return Yes otherwise what will return return no that's all that's the uh that's all the logic okay so let's move to pseudo code here's my functional prototype I am taking a b c and d integers as as a parameters and total sum is equals to A plus b plus C plus d okay now I'm checking for all the possible pairs among these if their sum is equals to Total some divid by two or not if it is happening then we're returning yes yes yes so we had three total pirs suchar payers okay sorry six total suchar payers not three okay 1 2 3 4 5 and six and what are the ab a c a d b c BD and CD okay you try it on your own if you find any more pair then let me know so there are possible six pairs here and if we don't get any yes I mean if we don't get this some equals to this toal some divide by two then in the else we fall in the else part and there we are returning no Okay so so that's all for this Brute Force approach for this problem I hope you understood it well thank you and we'll meet you sorry we'll meet you in the next [Music] session

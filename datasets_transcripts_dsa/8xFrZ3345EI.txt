my first relation to you would be that if you followed let's say a structured path of solving or learning redux algorithm my recommendation to you would be just go back and redo all the problems what you have done already right when you're getting this revision done right like your first worry is you are losing that confidence that do you even like are you able to solve problems or not and it's very important for you to get that confidence back right and just because you did some problems earlier does not mean that you will not have to solve those problems now you will have to solve all of them again because it's impossible to remember or like just learn the code right you will have to think about the logic you have to think about the code again so at least these problems are familiar and you will be able to quickly do them relatively and your revision will be done you'll feel that confidence that you're back into the business you are basically able to solve it so my recommendation would be like for the first phase of revision just quickly go through whatever you're done earlier just quickly go through those problems again

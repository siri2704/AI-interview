I learned so many data structures and algorithms that were never asked in any interviews for example I have never used segment trees in 100 plus interviews I have taken before you learn segment trees or any other advanced concepts there are some code data structures and algorithms that you need to know I have created a list of nine code data structures that you need to study for each of these nine data structures there are some popular algorithms that you must know there are also some techniques that are not specific to any data structure for example greedy algorithms recursion or dynamic programming I have added them to this list as well I have also marked whether you need to implement an algorithm or not to get this list you can go to instab by. and search for DSA master

did you know that you can visualize data structures directly in vs code this is the debug visualizer extension which lets you visualize data structures while debugging with this extension installed as you're debugging you can run the debug visualizer New View command you then specify an expression to evaluate and pick how to visualize it this code creates a length list so I'm going to view the list variable as a graph and as I step through the code we can see new nodes get added to this length list so it's similar to vs codes built in watch view but with visualizations of the watched value and I can interact with it by dragging it around here's another example we have a quick sort implementation so I can view the array as a grid and as it sorts we can see how the numbers get sorted through this algorithm you can see how this can be really helpful if you're learning about data structures or if you need help visualizing an algorithm

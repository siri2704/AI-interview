I will uh explaining From perspective of sd2 like three years engineer so generally there are four kind of question first is like DSA second lld then hld and then your project right so coming to DSA so I have broadly divided DSA into few categories like first was recursion so if you like make your this strong recursion is strong then you will be able to solve question from trees or backt track graph and some questions of greedy approach as well and along with your DP topic will be strong so this is one of the very important topic right and along with that let's say if you have a covered Ling list then this is also going to help you in trees Ling list and also Ling list in itself is very important yes so I have broadly divided DSA into few categories and I used to practice some important problems that might cover more than one

I have given 127 coding interviews in my life here are the top five algorithms they asked me at number five we have topk elements algorithm you need this algorithm to find topk largest elements in an array or topk most frequent elements in an array at number four we have the sliding window algorithm this algorithm is used to solve problems like longest substring without repeating characters or maximum sum subarray with length K next we have backtracking backtracking is used to solve problems like combination sum and Word ladder at number two we have dynamic programming or DP DP is used to solve problems like longest increasing subsequence and longest common subsequence at the top we have bread for search or BFS and depth for search or DFS both of these algorithms are used to Traverse graphs

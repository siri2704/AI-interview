[Music] hello everyone welcome to codesoft in this video we are going to see how we can sort an array that consists of zeros ones and twos so let's get started now the problem statement says that we have an array let's say as the given array is one zero two zero two one zero zero two now this this array consists of only zeros ones and twos we have to sort it so that the output looks like that first zero should come then once then twos so at this stage i would request you to pause the video and try the question on your own if you're not able to solve then please have a look at this video right now looking at the question you might be thinking that this is a normal sorting problem we can apply any algorithm sorting algorithm like merge sort which is an efficient one and our problem should be solved right but the problem here is that this question is meant to be solved in o of n time and the merge sort is basically uh solves the problem in o of n log n time right so what do we do here is that we apply something similar to counting sort we count the occurrences of each element let's say we count the occurrence of 0 in it we count the occurrence of 1 in this and we count the occurrence of 2 in this and if we talk about this question our 0 is coming 1 2 3 and 4 time so we save that 0 is coming 4 times and then in a variable and we create another variable we save the occurrences of 1 that is 2 and we save the occurrences of two that is one two and three so in three different variables we save the occurrences of each number and after that we go to the original array again and replace first four digits with zeros because four times zero is occurring in the array right and then after that we replace the next two element with one because one is coming twice and in the end last three elements we will just replace it with two so this is what the algorithm is if i talk about the logic in some written terms we create three variables a b and c each to store the frequency of zeros ones and twos respectively after that we loop through the array and increment the frequency of all the elements so whenever we encounter a 0 while looping through the array we will increment the frequency of a and whenever we will encounter 1 we will increment b similarly on encountering 2 we will increment c so when we have looped through the array and after the completion of traversal we will have the exact values of frequencies of 0 1 and 2 in abc right at that point first a element we can replace it with 0 next b element with 1 and the last c elements with 2 and that's it our array is sorted so let's go to our editor so i have created the same array here and the n here is n nine because there are nine terms in it so let's go for the problem so first we will create three variables let's just name them something logical it should be let's say count of zero count of one and count of two so these three variables will store the counts of zero one and two initially they all will be 0 because we have not started the traversal yet so we can just declare them 0 initially right so after this what we have to do is we need to traverse the array so for traversal what we will do we will start a loop from i equal to 0 less than n i plus plus and through this now what we will do is that we will increment the values of each each element 0 1 and 2. so what we will do is we will check that the coming element that is ari whether it is 0 if it is yes if it is 0 we will increment count of 0. and we will increment it right similarly if this is not the case we will check whether that value is equals to one if that is the case then we will increment the error one the count of one correct and if uh else in the else case if the both the cases are failing we will just increment the count two variable so what i'm doing is i'm looping through the array checking if the element from the array is zero if that is the case just incrementing the zeroth count or the frequency of zero similarly for one and if both of the cases are failing then i'll increment twos right so at the end of this at here all the frequency all the frequencies have been stored correct right so now we have stored all the frequencies so our expected answer should would be that count of 0 would now be 4 count of 1 will be 2 and count of 2 will be 3 as per our example right now what we have to do is we have to replace the first count zero that is first four values with zero then the next two values with one and the last three values with with two right so for that we will just loop again once and we will check for the first four values or first count zero values so first count zero values we can access through this that i is less than count zero right in this case we can just put our err i as zero now else if now what we have to do is we have so if we look at the question from zero to three index our numbers will be placed as zero now for from fourth to fifth index what we have to do we have to place two we have to place one in it right because we are having count one as two so what we will do is that when i is greater than equal to count of 0 that is when i is greater than 4 or equal to 4 and and i is less than count 0 plus count of 1 so this will actually be 4 plus 2 6 so what i am doing is i am checking if i if our i is greater than equal to 4 and less than 6 we will just place our rri as one correct and if this both the cases are failing then our arri simply goes as two correct so again explaining what we are doing is from here we are picking up first zero to three values or you can say zero to third index and placing zero in it and from from fourth to fifth index we are placing one in it and in the remaining sixth seventh and eighth eighth index we are placing the value as two so if i now print the array so i can just print the array once to check whether it is actually be actually sorted or not and let's just save the file okay and build the code so you can see four zeros two ones and three tools so our array is actually sorted and we have got the result that we were expecting so i hope the logic is clear and the question was clear to you thanks for watching stay tuned to add more face stones into your knowledge garland and till then please keep subscribing thank you

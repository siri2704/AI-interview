hello everyone welcome to my YouTube channel so that they can go from beginner level to advanced level in data structures and algorithms so firstly DSA important product based companies and for that matter Chala companies outside they test DSA problem solving skills in the candidate in their interviews so interviews the same solving skills me data structures understanding within the language which will further help you to do better when you are a software engineer so uh let's get started first first they need to learn a language so majorly C++ javaon three languages languag do DSA in their interviews so so that language doesn't make any difference butly days ofing and you want to choose a language I would say C++ is a better option C++ is a low language understanding and at the same time C++ standard template Library which we use to solve data structure problems in interviews prop and well written each data structure but it really doesn't matter if you already started with the language just go ahead with that how to initialize a variable what are different data types in that Language basic statements Loop before jumping into advanced topic I would say pattern printing problems so so solve those pattern problems first next do some basic problems in so basic problems in AR what is the first largest element in the AR second largest you'll get used to solving problems in DSA so instead of just learning and also start soling problems pattern problems B problems you can go and check them out after that oopsi programming Concepts so uh DS one of the major important thing is understanding space and time complexity comp so first of all comp Loop so language Basics syntax Concepts basic dat basic data Ty at the same time is also one of the DAT structure standard data structur Stacks cues link list hash maps and sets so let's say you picked set stack so stack perform like so dat stru we can insert an element we can delete an element we can search for an element and basically pict top to bottom already existing Li so implementation at the same time it will also make you understand the data structure better so uh what what are we doing now we are implementation operations and each operation complexity and standard template Library the next data structure Stacks cues link list hash Maps sets and priority cues complete okay trees and graphs you should start learning the algorithms so alith so that we can use them in our problems to solve them so standard Ali searching algorithms sorting algorithms two pointer and sliding window algorithms Ali Andi [Music] back to next trees and graphs to separate data structures one of the there is the she called as dver sheet so yoube take forward they he has a very nice playlist so where problems Based on data structure and algorithm div and easy medium hard so I'll the link to that sheet in the description it's more than enough like all the standard problems and all the intuitions are included in that sheet so our sheet almost data structure perfect and you should be able to crack most of the product based companies and understanding of the problem different approaches to to solve that problem that was very very helpful for for me during my preparation so I would say but all of that really doesn't matter there are thousands and thousands of problems problem so instead of that focus on covering all the topics and all the DAT structures you will be able to come up with your own intu at least so that is all from me guys definitely make a video on them and uh yeah that is all from me for today thank you so much for watching this video till this end and thank you so much bye-bye

here is the most asked coding question ever we're given an array of integers and we want to find two numbers in the array that sum up to the Target now the easiest way to do this is to look at all possible pairs of integers but that would use two indices I and J in a nested for Loop and that will make it big go of n^ squ to avoid looking at all the pairs we can make a hash map where each key will be the number and the value will be its index and we needed to map to the indices because the problem wants us to return those now we can just Loop through the array once which is going to be a big O of n solution and say hey is there a number which is our Target minus our current number in the hash map well yes it is the two indices we want to return is the one we're looking at and the one from the hashmap here's my python code follow me for more

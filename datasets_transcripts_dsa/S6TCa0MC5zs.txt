[Applause] [Music] hey everyone welcome to my channel in today's video we'll be discussing an essential topic for every program data structures and algorithms also known as DSA whether you're a beginner or preparing for a coding interview understanding DSA is crucial so let's get started what is data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science they help us write efficient code solve real world problems and even a technical interviews why is data structures and algorithms in for imagine you're searching for a book in a huge Library without an organized system it would take forever data stru and algorithms help us organize and process data efficiently just like a well arranged Library what are data structures a data structure is a way of organizing and sorting data some common types includes arrays which are like shelves in a library link list where each element point to the next Stacks which follow the lasting first out principle like a stack of plates cues which follow the first St first out home like a lines at a B stop trees and graphs which helps in complex relationships like social networks what are algorithms algorithms are step by step instruction to perform a task efficiently some key types includes searching algorithms like linear and binary resarch sorting algorithms like quick sort merge sort and bubble sort graph algorithms used in application like Google Maps relationship between data structures and algorithms algorithm operates on data structures to process data efficiently for example binary search work on a sorted array real life applications of data structures and algorithms DSA is everywhere social media apps use Q use to load content search engines use strees to rank web pages and online shopping platforms use hasht for past product [Music] searches mastering data structures and algorithms will make you a better programmer and improve your coding efficiency start practicing today and you'll see the difference if you found this video helpful don't forget to like share and subscribe see you in the next video [Music]

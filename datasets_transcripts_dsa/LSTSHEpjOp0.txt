there are multiple answers to that question and the question is as the video title says what topics to study what not to study questions there is no end to it do you relate to this question if yes please answer in the comment window so uh remembering my old days right when I was in college and I used to ask everyone keep bro so somebody used to say yes [Music] some used to say I don't study books foreign [Music] and at the end of the day medicine after one year I wasn't even able to code very well I struggled with the same thinking logics how do I make projects [Music] so what did I do next I started introspecting the meaning of life universe and everything and I realized that I am at Ground Zero and I need to reach somewhere I need to have an aim first so what was my aim my aim was placements I was like boss I need to study DSA for two things one reason is I should be able to code well because that's what I have decide in my career part to be and secondly I need to prepare well for placement oriented companies okay the companies you know that ask me coding related problems I should be able to answer those and then I realized one more thing is the thing is they are very related and I started making a chronological order out of it a sequential manner I prepared a graph that says that okay I'm gonna start from the very Basics I'm gonna start with say data structures from that I'm gonna study topics that are related to that from that I'm going to study topics that are related to that and at the end I'm gonna stop at a point I can use everything so this is what I call my zero to zero formula because I started at 0. and then I started connecting the dots and while I was connecting the dots I was able to revise the topics I was able to solve more complex problems and it gave me a very good framework to decide what to use in a problem what not to lose in a problem and everything became a piece of cake and yeah uh how did this help me out in future as well so when I was switching my job from Amazon to Google I really had no time to study and you wouldn't believe I just did 30 problems before my Google interview that's it I didn't do a single problem more than that and I was able to waste the interviews like that's why I was I'm translating in Google and this is one of the most challenging interview but one of the best tests to the structured framework that I had developed so let's see like what are the different topics that we are going to study I'm not saying that you should follow these things but it really helped me a lot and that's why I thought to share it with you all right guys so we are uh onto the computer now and let's start with our syllabus and thumb DSA history again so this is you right now billu zero and you're starting on with your DSA Journey computer architecture computers how computer is structured so we will first understand computer architecture in brief and then write our first hello world code starting first card we will talk about variables different data types we will learn about how to take input from the user then conditional statements and once we are done with these Basics parts we are going to study about our race problems we will talk about binary search to a lot of problems on these topics then extend our logic to two pointers then talk about strings then we start with recursion and once we start with recursion then we will start talking about depth first search and we'll start with DFS talk about DP and then end a course with backtracking and yeah in the end I assume that you might become hero blue but the thing is you need to follow things along practice well and yes you need to solve problems and it's not just about coding it is about the right process of thinking and throughout this course we are going to make a lot of videos we're gonna do a lot of problems we will talk about the thought process involved in problem solving and then solve it because that's gonna help you in the longer run so please stay tuned and see you around in the next videos thank you bye

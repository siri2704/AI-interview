hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back this video tutorial is relatively small compared to some of the other videos for algebra two goal one but specifically it has to deal with a couple of topics that tend to unlock a small metric mountain of des a topic so we gotta get them taken care of first especially since what we're going to be learning in this particular video tends to have particular what do I call a particular interest for certain topics as we move forward all right so first things first we got to talk about set builder notation more than anything else we're just getting used to how we're going to be doing this because looking at that is a bit of a mess to read ultimately what it says is Q is the set of all real numbers Z such as these and integer and is between negative four and negative three so all you want to do is we'll actually physically list its elements that's all we're doing so we're going to put in some squiggle brackets and then what do we have the numbers between integer so it's between negative four and negative three can we use negative four nope because there's not an or equal to so what can we use negative three yup and that's all we've got how about over here between negative one and three let's see we have negative one zero one two three can we use three yes because it's an or equal to can we use negative one no because it's not or equal to so therefore there's my entire list all right that seems not so bad we're just doing some squiggles and we're doing something that number lists that's doable we're fine next up graph it on the number line and then write using interval notation this is the actual new new stuff so here's what you need to know if your dot on your number line is open or if you're dealing with the number infinity you are going to be using parentheses if your dots on the number line it's closed then we are going to be using brackets that's the key for this right here so if we're looking at this one to start with we have the open circle it's greater than so it goes this way but what does the actual interval notation mean you need to know what you're starting your stop is so your starts is it three and your stop is what now it doesn't stop it goes on forever so what's the word for forever they predict Thank You other miss Dubois now they're in the other word for forever is infinite so with that in mind three is open it's a parenthesis infinity is well infinity so we're going to use parentheses how about over here now instead of using an infinity we actually have it between two numbers so we're looking at negative seven which is closed and then negatives negative for Miss Dubois actually read the signs there which is close as well and then we're squiggling everything in between what's our interval notation well where does it start negative seven where does it stop negative four and since both of them are closed in we know we're going to be using brackets okay so far so good and then Union that's another one and then intersection so they tend to give you symbols for those just so you know and again more things for your notes if you have a you that means Union which makes sense you know you for Union if it has the same letter start we're good if it's an upside down you where it looks kind of like an N it is an intersection that's what you're going to be looking for and that's how you measure out to keep phrases so if we're looking for G Union I what Union means is you're going to list everything everything in there brother okay so looking at that what do we have we have b c e g k and j that is everything in the sequence what about G intersect I how do we do that well intersection is what they have in common money so the question is do any of these numbers your teeth down here or vice versa now then there's a special symbol for that we call that the null set okay over here we want let's see here intersection so M intersect B okay you see how there's a K in both of those that's your intersection because that's what they have in common what about M Union B you're listing everything you can think of so B G H K we don't need to write k twice and then J and now to round ourselves off last topic B and C are the sets of real numbers is defined as follows write B Union C and B intersect C using interval notation this is where where it's actually a little bit easier to set it up on the number line visually we know that we have a 2 and we know that we have an 8 2 is closed and then we are less than so we're squiggling this way B is open and it's greater than so we're squiggling that way okay so B Union C we're going to be listing that and again we're using the interval notation so in case you've forgotten parenthesis is when it's open or infinity its brackets if it is closed so we're going from negative infinity so that's our end point 2 2 2 2 2 is closed infinity is open because it's an open ending number and Union also uses as an and we have 8 which is open and then we go off to infinity again which is open parenthesis mr. block B intersect C do they have anything in common in other words is there any overlap no so therefore we're going to use null set again over here we're going to set ourselves up yet again we have 1 & 8 okay one in eight one is open which is going to be less than and then eight is closed and then it is going to be greater than OC that's the same thing as before you know what I'm going to executive override and change this so we can make it something more palatable so we're going to cross these we're going to what we'll we'll do we'll cross this out in its entirety and we're going to replace it with hmm how about a greater than or equal to that will make for nice Brahma so now we can set this up that was terrible let's try that again there straight line is straight okay so now we still have the one and you still have the eight one is going to be greater than or equal to and so they were going to be squiggling this way and then eight is also going speak greater than or equal to and then we're squiggling this way huh see that there's a thing that's shaded by both it is shaded by both that's almost like that's important or something how convenient so first things first we're gonna have the Union see what are we going to be doing for that so when we're starting at one because that's where our bracket goes and then it goes all the way over to Anthony and Beyond which is open-ended okay what about D intersect C well I mean this whole area is kind of nice and all but it's a little isolated because it's not with anyone this here is the part that has all of the extra shading so we're starting at eight and then off into infinity and beyond which is often ended so again very very short series of topics but it unlocks a bunch of Deus eight questions hopefully this helps you as you start rounding out your goal one and getting your 85% as always stay happy stay healthy stay safe I'll see you in the next one

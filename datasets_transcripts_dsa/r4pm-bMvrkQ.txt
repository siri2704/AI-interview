so what was your parents' reaction when you told them about this they didn't believe that uh this is this was a slot one only I think 20 20 persons people of us got in slot one i think 15 10 to 15,000 people in VIT set every year in that batch of placement and only 20 30 people get uh placed in slot one so this was a first slot one company as well as first company in slot one so I think they were shocked they didn't even believe the day I got got placed next day I went home like uh we enjoyed a lot the that is not even explainable the emotions my father and mother had so my name is Goyel I'm a fourth year student in Valor Institute of Technology and uh I got a intern plus FD offer from Phone Pay so can you tell us uh more about your BTech experience what exactly did you study in your first year second year third year before you got this opportunity okay like in BTech as like uh it was a corona year so first and second year was like mostly I just did a course work and all i just uh focused on my CGPA uh like my CGPA was around 9.4 so that uh like it would give me more opportunities to sit in companies and from third year onwards uh when we got a like 5 months break from our college I started uh your uh DSA course as well as your webdev course so side by side in 2 3 months I completed your DSA course so that after that uh I could start CP for like 7 to 8 months uh long i do I did competitive programming which was the main reason uh like for what I got in phone pay and uh my web development was revolved around only or that main project which we did Airbnb uh so that was the only major project I had in my resume which like uh uh my manager manager round which was held in uh this phone pay interview a lot of focus was put in uh like uh that project had a half an hour of our uh discussion around that project authentication authorization part because phone pay works more on security purposes so they were fascinated to learn like how do did you implemented authorization authentication cookies how are you like uh doing password hashing and all uh like uh as it is a security and finance company so it was more interested in that so a half an hour of the conversation was just involved around that project after that just basic projects that was all my that uh college journey so describe more about the phone pay interview experience how many rounds were there and what was exactly asked in each round so Phone Pay came on 10th of July phone pay was the first company to came to our college so 11th of July we had our online assessment in which phone first criteria was like all the persons of all the branches who had a CGPA of of more than six were allowed to sit uh for the phone pay so all around 8 to 10,000 people applied I guess and which branch were you in i am in computer science in engineering branch and that a list came in which only nine pointers were shortlisted for giving the oning assessment test so 11th of July we had a online assessment in which I guess four questions were there i don't exactly remember the timeline i think it was 90 to 120 minutes so all the persons who did one question fully were able to proceed to the next round so I was able to solve two questions so two questions were of 3DP and two questions were of graph which I was not able even even able to touch so I solved both DP questions and after that uh after 2 days we got a mail that um I am selected for the next round of uh interview so on 16th of July we had a like full process so we we had total three rounds two were DSLGO rounds and one were one was HR come manager round in which HR manager projects everything was asked and so on 16th of July I had a first round which was DS elbow in which two questions were asked 50 minutes one medium question and one hard question one medium question revolved around I think sliding window and hard question was more about segmentaries like it can be solved using binary search and preompetition as well but easier way was to do a segment part and in second round of DSLGO one question I think was of DP uh DP of yeah I remember it was a I think a TCS codevita question uh I already uh did it it was a DP question but more optimization was in n login sorting part and that this was a medium question and hard question was of I think graph yeah so it was a graph question and last round was manager HR round so I already told 30 minutes just revolved around our project which was that Airbnb part how I implemented authorization authentication cookies how I'm storing password how I'm sending passwords that's all And other questions were just like uh team conflicts behavior type of questions what is your hobbies how will you solve conflicts and like things like just simple behavior questions which are HR type of questions like what will you do in phone pay how do you see your future in phone pay that's all okay so this and after 10 15 days I got my result so can you tell us what helped you more uh to get selected in phone pay was it uh your DSA uh part or was it development which one of them helped you more i think more the thing which like I more focused on DSA and that only helped me in cracking the online assessment and proceeding to HR round after that it is obviously you should work in paddler it is not like you should uh like you can only learn DSA and leave development you have to learn both the things but yeah DSA I was more focused towards DSA and development also I was doing parally but yeah like it was a like if I gave DSA 5 hours I was giving development daily 1 hour so that I can do I can do both things parallelly h so apart from I spent a lot of time in doing competitive programming okay I think that was the major reason I cracked online assessment because like I think 2,000 of the people was not even like 99% people was not able to solve one question h it was so like uh high level questions so uh in terms of DSA or in terms of CP how many questions do you think you would have solved like in the entire uh your uh journey of preparation i think it would be more than 1200 1 1200 plus and what were the platforms uh that you used the most like uh the most used platforms were code forces and lead code lead code I would have solved around 300 plus questions and code forces it would be 7 800 on my main ID and what is your current uh ranking there on both of the platforms uh lead code like I was uh like it is more than I think 2100 m I was just able to like I was reaching guardian when I got placed after that I didn't give any contest and on code forces it is expert okay so what would you advise a student who is just starting their coding journey or maybe has done DSA but now they want to step into competitive programming how should they approach starting with CP i think uh all all the people have a belief that we should learn whole DSA then we should start competitive programming that is where all the people do a mistake you should start competitive programming and learn the topics which are needed in that question in that way you would be able to learn more like if I know this question requires segmentaryry I'm not aware of or I don't I'm not like I'm not done it properly so I go I learn segment come back to the question implement it then uh solve it as a solution then put it as a solution and after that whenever I get a segment question I like I'll know that I have done this uh like earlier I'll take some reference or uh if I remember I'll just code it directly that is the I think most important part we should do like later don't do DSA at all at once that would be I think more difficult than doing a little little chunks of that all right so uh apart from DSA and development did theory subjects also play any role in your selection no in my selection they didn't ask anything about theory just projects behavior and HR and both DS rounds was just uh two DS uh questions that's all okay and what about communication skills how important do you think they are communication skills are thing I think is the most important part that is at most that is most important than DSA as well it does not matter that how how does you solve your question in interview it matters how do you communicate your problem solving and how do you tell what is your like how are you solving your problem approach and how are you explaining the most important thing that matters is that interview should uh like understand what are you explaining and what are you coding that is the most important part in one's interview that a lot of people ignores a lot of people will do a lot of questions in lead code but they would not be able to make other people understand that what I have coded so a lot of people what should we do is like we should make a friend sit and explain uh him that how I I am solve ing that question that will help a lot because I have helped my friends in a lot of questions that helped me a lot in explaining the interviewer what is my approach so before uh your phone pay interviews did you also practice mock interviews with your friends no I never uh like practiced anything i thought that that this was our first company i thought after going to college I'll practice but before uh started even I started even practicing I got placed okay nice so what was your parents reaction when you told them about this they didn't believe that uh this was this was a slot one only I think 20 20 persons uh people of us got in slot one I think 15 10 to 15,000 people in VIT set every year in that batch of placement and only 20 30 people get uh placed in slot one so this was a first slot one company as well as first company in slot one so I think they were shocked they didn't even believe the day I got got placed next day I went home like uh we enjoyed a lot the that is not even explainable the emotions my father and mother had okay so what kind of tech stack are you working in uh like are you working on in phone pay right now uh currently I'm uh a back end engineer and I'm working more on Java drop vizard uh dockers and uh kafka rabbit mq um this my myql aerospike and lot many more so uh when a student is in college they generally struggle with this idea of picking a good programming language for themselves so how did you pick your programming language and uh which programming language did you use for your DSA my major reason for speaking was your course only that your course were that time was only in Java I guess when I like buy your course that was just a Java course so like I think that um it doesn't programming language doesn't matter at all you can do the thing which matters is your problem solving your thinking skills but yeah if you do Java it would be helpful because now back end a lot of things are written in Java if you want to go towards back end if you want to go towards like ML and all you should do more of Python that is what but like it doesn't matter a lot you can do you if you are comfortable in CPP you can do any language h okay and u so you did your DSA with Java then to do CP did you shift to C++ no no no so you did your entire competitive programming in Java entire thing I did in Java I had a lot of problems because of Java Because sometimes problem Java take a lot of time execution time of Java is more than CPP so same question if I'll uh give Chad GPT and tell uh it to convert to CPP and if I upload the same solution it will work but it will not work in Java but then also I stayed with Java so that I could learn more uh when I am not able to solve the question I'll I'll like I look for more optimizations which if I had CPA I would not have looked that is I think another reason I could optimize uh these I could solve two questions in OA which require a lot of optimizations okay and you think that that helped you in your entire learning journey yeah that helped me a lot okay so your advice to uh students picking a programming languages pick anything uh if you want to just learn a general DS and then do CP then Java and CP CPP both are fine but if you want to choose a a IML path then Python would be the preferred choice okay so one because Java is helping me now as well i'm writing back and holding Java yeah cpp guys are also doing fine but yeah I am able to pick them pick faster i know how Java works how in inheritance works how things work in Java like I'm able to understand like little faster at some point of time we'll reach uh at equal levels but now I have some edge above people who have done CPB in their colleges okay so now since uh you have entered uh the industry uh with your internship and you'll soon uh join them full-time so uh what do you think uh uh is the role that AI tools uh play in the life of a working software engineer in the industry In 2025 do you get to use AI tools is it recommended in organizations what is your take uh yeah Phone Pay has his internal GPT like if we need to write something that is very general if I need to write some SQL query why will I waste my time writing a SQL query or apply my brain i know that a thing where we don't need a lot of problem solving that we need that we know AI can do m so like AI can't replace a software engineer but it can help software engineer in doing the things which earlier I uh like I can do in 10 days now I can do in 5 days with the help of AI if I need to write some test yeah I can ask chat GP like internal GPT of company to help me in writing test or if I need to build some design patterns I can ask GPT uh to help me in like explain how design patterns work how to make a design pattern uh obviously it can't replace a software engineer but then it can help you in your daily life if I have to do like a work which takes me like six to five five to 6 hours now I can I am able to do in two to three hours with the help of AI i regularly use AI whenever like I think I know this this type of work is uh like I don't need to apply my brain this is a generic work i know I have written a whole code but I need to implement some models some design patterns or something so I'll ask GPT to do my work instead of putting my brain into it okay so what would you recommend a student who is uh just starting with their coding journey like how if they are interested in CP then what is the uh recommended number of months that they should spend on CP before their placement start i think it depends from person to person like it is not uh it doesn't matter how much time you spend it it wholly matters how much quality time you spend and how how much topics and how much things do you learn like it matters uh like if you are solving a question you should know if this is a DP question you should know why this is solved with DP and why not with greedy greedy questions you should know why is this solved with greedy and why not DP If you're solving a greedy ocean you should solve it deeply as well to know what are the pros and cons uh of both the uh that uh both the um uh things uh like what is the differences and you should know why only this approach will work and why not other approaches will work m that is the main thing whenever you are solving a question you should know everything why this approach uh you should like understand the basics of the thing then only you should start coding okay and uh what do you think was the role of alpha and delta in your preparation journey i think uh the project we made had a lot of role in my selection in manager round manager was a lot uh impressed with my project which I did it uh it included lots of things i was fascinated by back end we did a lot of the stuffs in back end i think we included mostly everything which a like college guy needs to learn in back end like uh basic things we we have done each and everything which I could explain a lot of things were there which I could not even explain him because I could not remember that things because we did a lot we did like we implemented a lot of things the main things revolved around authentication authorization these are very important things so yeah like uh and alpha uh like with DSA I started DSA doing with your course and that gave me a base on how DSA works uh how should I approach a problem after that only I was like able to appro go to go to CP and get results which take a lot of time I could get in less time okay so uh is there anything else that I would uh that you would like to share about your entire preparation journey uh I I don't think so i have mentioned everything i think only thing I should mention is that every student in once in lifetime if he is doing computer science and engineering he should try competitive programming that is my advice like it is you should not do it from the perspective of displacement you should do it as a hobby when your rating will go down and up you'll keep on enjoying this will like this will become eventually a sport i like after like one or two months I started doing CP just because of sports a lot of friends told that CP will not give you as much as output as you are giving it input but I just continued just because I I enjoyed doing CP so like once in your career journey I am not saying it is compulsory but yeah you should have a taste of CP how does like how does CP works how does rating works if you see your rating going up you'll have a good enjoyment if it is going down you'll learn that why it is going down you'll learn a lot more so that is what it will uh like teach you a lot of things how to handle pressure not only coding But a lot of things CP will teach you how to apply brain in edge cases that will that helps me today as well if I'm writing some backend code I know there can be some edge cases what if this doesn't exist then I have to handle this this all things I think CP can teach you okay and what platform would you recommend them to start with you can start with any platform but yeah I I did code forces that is the I think best platform to do um CP but any platform is fine until unless you're doing CP lead code also has now contest weekly I I used to wake up at 8 to give contact contest lead code contest that is at 8 I guess 8 uh at Sunday morning I used to wake up with my friends so that we can give contest what advice would you give to a student who is sitting for placements in 2025 my advice would be to uh focus more on online assessment first clearing that part I think is the most difficult part because that is the time when 90% of the people are uh uh like uh 90% only 10% of the pe people are selected after that things become a little easier as interviewer can also help but in OA nobody is there to help you you need to think of every edge case and pass the whole test case so that your chances increases to uh get a interview call generally when a student uh he or she starts with DSA a common problem that they encounter is they are able to understand the fundamentals u maybe the concepts of DSA they are able to solve a question after seeing the solution but whenever a new question comes they're not able to build the logic so did you also face that problem and if you did how did you manage that yeah I also faced earlier when I was doing G code I faced this problem a lot but when I started doing CP this is what CP taught me uh like like that is what I was telling you should learn the basics of the thing why will greedy work like if you see DSA is very simple like when I approach a problem I know this can be a greedy problem we can use a presum i'll start from the down i'll use greedy if this is a this is a problem I'll tell this is a greedy problem then I'll try to write test cases which which will in which greedy won't work okay so greed is uh now cut out now I'll try prefix some if this doesn't work then I'll try at the end dp like you should write test cases for what uh for you should make a condition then write test cases for that condition to not not to work if it it is not happening then you should uh write solution first what what I used to do I used to think a solution then I used to think test cases which uh which will not fit in this solution that's all then you'll like uh if you do DSA it is not a very big task only if you see a problem it it can be solved only two three approaches and you should see which is the best optimized to solve it if you like I think you should do basic questions first then you'll uh you should do advanced this is not like you should directly go to lead code and try hard that till now I would not be able to do that you should start with easy make your basics build your DSA concepts after that you should increase your uh that complexity day by day that is what I will advise and how many code forces contest do you think uh you might have given in the entire uh preparation time i think it would be more than uh 30 30 40 okay uh all right it was really nice talking to [Music] you i never switch sides like even when I die I'm a ride for the squad

foreign yeah so actually in the beginning only few members are there actually uh the actual schedule was last week only only few members are there that's why just we have planned to extend the demo sessions that is the reason why we postponed to today anyway it will be continued it is a regular classes only okay thanks how we can manage actually we are going to office no no no no actually uh evening and morning sessions also already there but just in the 11 o'clock we started a new batch this is the new batch which will be scheduled at 11 o'clock only so if you are not comfortable with this timings you can go for either evening or morning but as of now there is no years there is no new batches now this is the new batch we can do records and uh we can connect yeah yeah you can you can you can you can do that you can connect and no no no just we are taking these classes only in the online I'm I'm working from my home so that's why you can connect with me through WhatsApp or we will have a discussion session on weekends so there you can clarify all your notes okay okay right yeah sir let's start our session please wait at the end I will clarify all your doubts so good morning good morning everyone I request everyone to please on mute and don't see it will come through online your voice is low now it was okay before my evening yeah now is it okay is my voice is clear now yes yes thank you yes right right so welcome to um still some people are telling it is not audible one second please connect to audio right so welcome to Durga soft online training and welcome to data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms with Java sorry with the python okay so welcome to data structures and algorithms with the python course sir what is this course first let me give introduction to myself myself okay prakash Babu having almost uh 15 years of experience as a trainer sir in today's session just we are going to give introduction this introduction to this course and what syllabus that we are going to cover in this course just outline introduction I am going to provide for you people first let me talk about the syllabus or let me talk about the details of the course sir coming to this course the title of this course is nothing but data structures and algorithms data structures and algorithms with python python the short name BAC with python actually this is the third batch this is the third batch that we are taking already first batch second batch equals completed this is nothing but the third batch that I'm taking foreign the timings of this batch the timings of this batch is nothing but 11 o'clock so 11 am it will be started at 11 am so 11 to 12 or 12 15 PM we are going to take okay and these classes will be there from Monday to uh Saturday sir okay Monday to Saturday probably on Saturday we will have doubts clarification section or we will have some programming sessions like that Saturday we are going to have some interaction system okay probably Monday to Friday the regular classes will be there so next coming to the duration of this course is the duration of the course is nothing but to two months within two months we are going to finish this syllabus sir I can say so July and August so maximum at the end of the August we are going to wind up this particular course okay at the end of August we are going to wind up this course so next and after that so what is the fees for this batch it is a rupees I think you know about the fees already in the link also we have given the complete information the fees is rupees triple nine is nothing but the fix sir if I want to get registered to whom we need to contact 9246 -212143 or you can contact 7207 two one two four two seven or you can contact to Durga soft online training online training at gmail.com so any one of these you can use to make a connection with our admin team and you can discuss whatever doubts that you are going to get okay like about the course or anything anything or if you want to get registered all these things you can get running notes running notes via so Google Drive okay so next you are going to get videos also these are recorded videos also we are going to get in the help of try but these videos you have six months access six months access so the people who want to watch these videos no problem you can get the register this is the latest batch right you can get registered for this course and whenever you have a time you can able to watch the videos suppose if you are unable to attend the live classes no problem you can get registered for this and you can uh watch the videos on daily basis of course once if the class is completed on the same day itself we are going to uploaded the recorded session so that you can able to watch and you can get your doubts can be clarified okay anyway we are going to create a communication medium like WhatsApp group we will create from that also we can able to communicate if any discussion is there you can ping me directly I will give response for that okay I mean I'm talking about the students who are unable to attend a live classes for them I am giving this instruction and the students those who are attending live classes no problem every day we are going to have the discussions and we are going to complete a topic so once if I if I have taken one simple topic after explanation I will ask uh for your doubts if any doubts are there or if if the concept is not understood where you are getting the problem so in that particular module I will explain in detail by taking the diagrams also so this is nothing but what we have about our course and the action plan okay so once if you are clear with this then I will explain the syllabus what we are going to cover in this data structures and python here sir there are two concepts will be there we are going to cover some algorithms and we are going to cover some data structure so both will be covered but these are nothing but language independent data structures are different algorithms are different so if I want to go for implementation of that data structure or algorithm compulsory we have to write the code right to test the to test the program or to test whether it is working or not compulsory you need to write some program that a programming language tool which we are using in this course is nothing but python that is nothing but what we have sir if we are clear with this course uh I mean uh information about this course I will explain the syllabus what we are going to cover any doubts in this course details are please confirm yes I have a question here yes sir yes uh see using as you said it is independent of this programming language so can can we help us like to optimize the python coding and style and all oh yeah yeah we are going to CC algorithms means for any problem we are going to get multiple ways to solve the problem right because I I because basically I am working I'm working guys so I we have a lot of performance issues I am basically enrolled for this course to optimize this python way of whatever the coding is already there so I just want to implement that for that one maybe maybe we will see sir but for not all algorithms we are going to get uh optimized record okay so here the intention of this course is nothing but not optimization or not to simplify the tasks here the content is nothing but uh you know maybe you are working a working person and you are a professional that's why you can expect from your end but actually this course is nothing but explaining the need of data structures in the market and suppose if I have any data structure like Linker list is there means what are the various operations that we can able to perform on Linker list so suppose if you take I want to insert a node in the middle so we have so many ways are there to do that but among that I am going to explain the easiest way which can be understandable by the programmer I mean every person so in that manner we are going to see and we will analyze the time complexity also for every operation that we are going to do okay any other person having doubt in this course content or good afternoon I had completed in 2016 so many year Gap is there sir okay because and prepare some examination is some healthy problems issues there okay then present time what we are doing some suggestions to give me give me those those things we will discuss in the regular classes and after completion of that uh we will have some interaction about uh uh your style of job or what you are doing how you can switch to other fields all these things we will discuss in the regular classes this is Mark correct time sir this course is going to be helpful the prerequisite for this course is nothing but you should have a minimum knowledge in Python if you don't know python then it is very difficult for you to understand compulsory the prerequisite for this course is nothing but a python sir if you don't know python then you can't able to understand whatever content that I am going to deliver for YouTube okay oh right so let's go for the syllabus what we are going to cover in this total duration what is the syllabus that I am going to explain in this particular course let us discuss sir as a first topic so as a first topic we are going to talk about the introduction okay introduction to data structures introduction to data structures and algorithms so what is mean by data structure what is mean by algorithm what classifications are there like how many types of data structures are there so what are these data structures what techniques they are going to follow and the algorithms how to Define algorithms how to prepare algorithm what are the different types of algorithms are existed all these things we are going to cover and in the second chapter we are going to see analysis analysis of algorithms sir I want to analysis algorithms where we are going to discuss about time and space complexities okay where we are going to talk about so our analysis of algorithms are complexities okay complexities of algorithms how you can calculate the time complexity how to calculate space complexity all these things sir after this uh actually this course is completely we are going to implement it by using python so you people are already having some idea about a python but just for revision purpose we are going to collect some sample programs okay sample problems we are going to discuss so with the python implementation okay so like maybe Fibonacci number so generating the sequence okay some of your natural numbers prime number okay like that we are going to select some problems and we will try to implement that a problem in Python so what is the advantage of this third unit is nothing but you people are going to get some idea about uh the upcoming Concepts what we are going to cover and even we are going to refresh your knowledge in Python suppose tomorrow if I want to perform push operation on a stack compulsory we have to write the code in Python so if you are decoding then it is very easy to implement just we need to analyze the algorithm and directly we can go for implementation so to get efficiency on this just for practice purpose we are going to select some 30 or 20 sample problems sample programs and we are going to demonstrate those programs in Python sir okay foreign data structures are there in Python okay so python inbuilt okay python inbuilt data structures like we have a string data structure is there you know very well list data structure is there so Tuple data structure is there set data structure is there and then dictionary data structure is there just we are going to give some theoretical information like what is mean by string when we can go for this spring data structure what is mean by list when we can go for this list data structure what are the common operations that we can able to perform all these things in detail it is also something like revision to python okay python of the course is python languages needed for that or you will teach the python as well in that no no no no no no no we are not going to teach python you should know already python then only it is good like basics of python or basics of python is sufficient um yeah at least 30 percent of knowledge you should have in pyth answer because you see we are going to write the entire program in Python see understanding the concept is very simple sir okay but once if you go to the real-time examples for example if you take a recursion I will explain the theoretical concept you can develop algorithm but converting that algorithm into program is our main agenda right in that case the language which we are selecting is nothing but a python so compulsory you should have an idea about python if you don't know python then it is it is somewhat difficult to understand okay okay right yeah first let me complete the syllabus exclamation then we will go with the chorus sir we are going to see the inbuilt data structures in Python after this sir string data structure is there right in detail about the string data structure and the programs programs on Spring data structure under programs on spring data structure we are going to Sir because the most commonly used data structure in every reprogramming language and the everywhere in the real time is nothing but a stream we are going to discuss about in detail about the string and we are going to see the programs on this string data structure also okay so next and after that we are going to see list data list or I can say array data because in other programming languages it is iterated as array but here it is considered as a register and we are going to see list or array based programs list or array based programs okay like we are going to cover almost some 30 to 40 applications purely on list like Matrix programs and suppose if I have a list how you can able to identify the duplicated events how we can able to identify the unique elements so how to find out minimum element maximum element I want to sort the data in ascending order how you can do I want to find out the second and largest element okay like different types of algorithms we are going to work on this list or array data string so programs based on stream in data structure so list programs based on list data structure we are going to cover sir after completion of this there is one beautiful algorithm is there with name recursion recursion so completely sir what is mean by recursion when we need to go for recursion what kind of problems we can able to solve by recaption tail recursion means what non-tailed recursion means what like the complete Theory analysis about this application we are going to cover after completion of this we are going to see the recursion based applications so here also around some 20 programs we are going to cover how the recursion is going to work how you can able to trace back the recursions how the recursive calls are going to be maintained everything we are going to discuss after completion of this sorting sorting algorithms and we are going to cover searching algorithms sorting and searching algorithms next and after that divide and conquer algorithms okay sir what is mean by sorting we know very well if we have a data is there arranging that data in ascending order or descending order is nothing but serving even if you want you can prepare that in the customized manner okay arranging the data in some order is nothing but what sorting algorithms we have different types of sorting techniques are there like we have Bubble soft insertions art okay quick start to merge this art okay selections are next and after that accountings after radixes after like we have different types of sorting techniques are there so every resulting Technique we are going to cover with some examples and we are going to analyze time complexity of a very sampling techniques okay how much time it is going to take and the contradiction to this searching algorithms what is mean by searching searching for the data for example my list is having some 100 elements are there I want to search for an element how you can able to perform that search operation we have different types of searching techniques are there we have linear searches there we have binary searches there linear search means water searching for the data continuously from the beginning binary search means dividing the data into two halves anyway tomorrow just at least introduction about that I will explain don't worry then divide on the conquer algorithms also we are going to discuss divide and the Conqueror means what if I have a big problem is there how we can divide that problem into individual steps and how you can solve that individual steps we are going to discuss in this divide and the concrete is merges are techniques art and uh this binary search all these things will comes under divide under concrete only sir after this we are going to see backtracking backtracking is also one of the application what we have do you know in this we are going to solve n Queens problem under Sudoko problem is there right so this n Quince problem on the Sudoku problem with the live explanation I am going to discuss so one by one step by step I am going to write a code and we will see how we can able to solve these symptoms okay next and after that almost almost all the algorithms we are going to finish here next we are going to see Dynamic program what is mean by dynamic programming what kind of applications we will discuss in the dynamic programming then we are going to see greedy algorithms how to develop greedy algorithms how we can apply sir after this we are going to see linked list data structure till now we have discussed only algorithms now we need to apply that algorithms and we have to implement some data structures in that the first data structure is nothing but a linked list data structure then the second data structure is we are going to talk about stack data structure so it is a special data structure sir which follows lifo technique I think you know very well even in the system also we are going to maintain the stack and after these we are going to talk about the queue data structure so what is mean by queue data structure how to implement that queue in detail we are going to discuss next and after that hash table okay hash table or we can use hash hashing data structure what is mean by hashing how we can able to implement this hashing we are going to discuss so next and after that the very very important thing that is a tree data structure what are the various applications or of trees are there okay we are going to see minimum 10 to 15 applications on these trees in the trees we are going to cover simple tree binary tree binary circuitry and AVL trick these are the main Concepts that we are going to cover then we are going to see priority priority queues priority queues or I can use another word called heaps heaps also weekends like this we are going to discuss and at the last sir we are going to see graph data structure okay graph data structure what are the various applications of graphs are there and at last with one small topic we are going to wind up that course which is nothing but bit manipulation bit manipulations this is nothing but a total 25 chapters that we are going to cover as a part of our course what is the course here Paca with python okay I think you have clear clarity about the syllabus which we are going to discuss now if you are having any queries please feel free to ask your questions foreign core python is a sufficient maximum maybe we are going to use oops Concepts also there if you are unable to understand just you can give me a reminder I will explain that the concept for five to ten minutes and we will go for the program okay right everyone please confirm is the concepts are clear for you people yes please confirm uh sir those concepts are you are teaching from the scratch right so yes we are not from this background so that's it yeah yeah we are we are going to start from the scratch maybe in the demos you may feel somewhat hard because in the demonstration I am going to explain some topics randomly I will pick up some topics and I will explain but once if our course got started you will get in detail don't worry okay this algorithms and all you are linked with python and your explainer right yeah for example if you see uh I told right some divide and conquer algorithms are there suppose if I have if I want to perform sorting operation I want to apply divide and configure so starting with the divide and the concur technique is nothing but merge is already there first I will explain the algorithm we will take some 10 elements and I will explain diagrammatically how we are going to divide that at an element and how we will combine the 10 elements to perform sorting operation after algorithm I mean after explanation of that we are going to implement this program in Python and we will give various inputs and we are going to check whether the algorithm is working correctly or not and we will calculate time complexity of that algorithm that is our agenda okay someone is asking sir easy to demo or regular class already we started sir but only for five classes or four classes you can attend without paying any fees so those are demos okay already we entered into DSA okay right so maybe my question is wrong or not I'm not sure so I want to know so this algorithm is required for every programming like C C plus plus Java and python it is that's what I told in the beginning itself data structures and algorithms is independent of programming language it is a concept we can Implement that a concept by using any programming language so if you are implementing by using C language then you have to use C language instructions to write the code if it is a Java we have to implement the program by using Java if it is C plus plus DSA with C plus plus so like that it is a language independent account successor every programmer should understand this in this course we are going to implement by using python even I am handling data structures and algorithms with Java so there the chapters are same but the coding I am going to write in Java that's all got it is right so this is nothing but what we have today okay so tomorrow we will continue and among these 24 topics tomorrow I am going to select some two topics and I will explain the process in the outline and I will show you the program for that but definitely I won't Implement that programs because in the chapters in detail I will explain because in the demo session you need to understand whether you are following my lectures or not is it understandable manner or not and is the concepts that you can able to digest or not all these things you have to check that's why in the tomorrow session I am going to explain some two algorithms how those algorithms are going to work okay it is not guarantee that you need to understand the concept just at the outline you have to see okay oops yeah can I ask one question sir yes yes sir please so is there any garbage collection concept is here I mean no no garbage collection concept is not at all required here okay because in Python and Java memory allocation is the responsibility of the programmer once if you allocate the memory so once if your application got closed garbage collector is going to destroy the memory automatically so we are not required to concentrate on the two parts okay okay all right okay sir that's all about today's session remaining things we will continue in the tomorrow's class okay right sir thank you see you tomorrow same link you have to use to connect thank you thank you sir thank you

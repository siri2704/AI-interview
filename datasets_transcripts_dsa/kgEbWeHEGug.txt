W students next The Divide and concure method divide and is a powerful algorithm design used to solve problems by bre breaking them down into smaller more manageable sub problems the idea is to divide the problem into smaller parts con those parts recursively and then combine the result to solve the original problem so problem find the maximum number in an unsorted array element div divl the AR into two element recurly find the maximum element in each compare the maximum elements from both hes and return the larger one let us assume we have an array of numbers 1 9 5 28 unsorted divide split the array into two offs so in the array 319 for the first off find the maximum of 319 maximum 5 for the second find the max maximum maximum the thir 39 maximum 9 58 maximum 8 maximum number Max time complexity the time complexity for this divide and concure approaches big of n because every element is compared exactly one where n is the size of the array big of mention timing big of n each division step takes constant time and we are dividing into two next advantages of divide and concer first paralyzable sub problems are independent they can be solved simultaneously in par procing environment output paraly Simplicity many problems can be broken down into smaller simpler problems this leads to clear and elegant solution so the div and meod div disadvantages of divide and concure first overhead recursive calls can introduce overhead especially when dividing the problem into too many problems memory usage some div Ali Ali for example merge sort it require additional memory to store sub arrays or result from recursive call the merge screenshot first divide and conure definition example so continuation continuation time complexity advantage and disadvantages watch other episodes in the appropriate playlist forg silver Academy strength success Clara w

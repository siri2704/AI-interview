hello everyone in this video we're going to see which is the best DSA course on YouTube so recently I've been getting a lot of questions asking me which is the best DSA course on YouTube and people are asking me things like which course they should take whether they should take lover bus course whether they should take up now College course whether they should take drivers course and a lot of people are confused like this and they're asking me a lot of questions like that like very much recently so what I decided to do and what I have here is I have these courses with Harry and what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a comparison between these courses so these were six of the most requested courses that people wanted to know about so I'll be making a comparison between all of these courses I'll be telling you everything in details and then the final verdict lies with you so at the end of the video you can decide for yourself which is the course that you want which is the course that would be best suited for you and I'm going to tell you everything about each of the courses the advantages the disadvantages Etc in details okay and the thing is that all of the courses are very different from one another that's why you have to be the one to decide which one you should take but I am going to tell you everything about each of the course so let's start with lover Buzz Code health so love purpose code help series and here's C plus plus placement preparation series that he has is uh here yeah so level has a series completely plus placement DSA course and one great thing about this course is that it starts from the very very beginning so this teaches you intro to programming and it even teaches you programming via flowchart so if you are someone who's a complete beginner so let me write this down so if you are someone who is a complete beginner then you can definitely take this course it's completely beginner friendly it starts from the very very scratch so that is something that I really like so it starts from all the way from programming flowchart to writing your first program in Cel FL and everything and then it covers pretty much every important topic that is there so it is also complete so let me write that the course is also complete and also the courses in C plus like I mentioned no coming to the disadvantage one disadvantage that I found of this course is that it only covers most of the classical problems and it doesn't cover a lot of problems okay so I feel like they could have covered more problems for explaining the concepts but they don't have a lot of problems so let me write not much Variety in problems okay so they don't have a lot of variety in problems they could have covered more problems according to me for explaining topics like graph dynamic programming Etc so lover by C plus plus course is something that you can definitely take and it is very much beginner friendly but like I said it doesn't have a lot of problems so if you take this course then do know that you're gonna have to solve a lot of problems by your own to make sure that you understand everything to the details to the T So this course you can definitely take there's no issues it is complete it is beginner friendly and it the disadvantage is that it doesn't have a lot of variety of problems okay coming to another yes course is in Java right so this course is in Java dsa1 so this course is also complete right so he has said that the course is complete like I remember seeing the last video that it only took 1.5 years or something to complete the course I think he have yeah so this is the last final video so he has covered everything in 100 lectures so that's the benefit that the course is complete let's get to the disadvantages but the advantage is that it's complete now the disadvantage is that he has covered everything in only 100 lectures okay so if you're learning everything that there is in DSA I really don't think yet you can cover it in 100 lectures okay like unless you're doing everything very briefly so the course is not very vast that's one disadvantage so let me write that it's not very vast the course is not very worse he has tried to cover everything in 100 videos and if I compare that to striver right subscriber already have 57 videos for dynamic programming only subscriber has 57 videos just for dynamic programming while Anuja has completed the entire DSC codes in just 100 videos so that is one thing that the course is not very vast and then another disadvantage is that it only covers classical problems so let me write classical problems only so as far as I could see he has only covered the classical problems like reversaling list or from there for dynamic programming like for example for dynamic programming he has only explained the classical problems like knapsack longest common subsequence lies Etc he hasn't covered like the problems that are not classical you know sales only covered most of the classical problems these are two of the disadvantages but yeah if you're learning Java then you can definitely consider taking his course but do remember that it's not very worse so you might have to look into some other resource while learning and again you'll have to solve a lot more problems by your own okay but that is there for all of the courses like what I would suggest no matter what course you take at the end do work hard on your own and do solve a lot of problems on your own but I'll get into that later 2003 escorts again it's in Java the advantage is that it's complete you don't have to wait for any more video and the disadvantage is it's not very vast and it only has Classical problems only now coming to take you forward okay so take you forward there's Series wise so I don't think he has just one course but he has series like Daniel programming playlist recursion playlist graph series etc etc and take you forward has really great quality of content okay so blah blah also have good quality of content but take you forward has great quality of content so I've watched all of these courses videos but Tiki forward is something that I've been looking into that I've been watching ever since from my college days so Shriver has really really great content his way of teaching is very great he explains everything very very beautifully and the concepts are explained in a very nice manner but uh like a disadvantage of this is that it's not very much beginner friendly so not completely beginner friendly so you do need to have a little bit basic understanding of DSA just a little bit basic understanding of DSC to take take your forward course so it's not completely big enough friendly this is like one and the only disadvantage that I could find of this course other than that it's like beautifully explained so let me write this beautifully explained pretty much the best content that you can get out there for free and great quality especially for dynamic programming and graph entries so these are topics which are very difficult right like graph series DP recursion but he has explained everything in a very very beautiful Manner and he has not covered just the classical problem but he has covered a lot more problems than that so in his in all of his series you'll see that he has covered a lot of problems for example Dan programming playlist you can see that he has covered so many problems for you to understand the topic and he is not limited to C plus plus that's also advantage that he covers tries to cover C plus plus and Java so this is a really really great course and you can definitely take this especially if you want to learn Advanced topics like dynamic programming recursion trees graphs Etc this is one course that you can definitely take and the only disadvantage the only disadvantage that I could find is that it is not completely beginner friendly so this course this is one course that you can definitely consider buying it's an awesome course for you pretty much the best quality that you can get for free so after striving we have Kunal kushwaha and Kunal kishwa also has a course so he has a DSA course in Java so let me write Java here is someone that I'm not really fond of and I don't agree with a lot of things that says but I do respect him for his skills and he has some really great teaching skills so the quality of his videos and the quality of his content is really commendable and his teaching skills are almost on parvitz driver so it's almost on parvitz driver the quality of the content that he produces so the course is pretty great great especially if you're learning with Java but there is one huge disadvantage of this course and that is that it's not at all complete so this course is not at all complete it doesn't cover any of the advanced topics and I don't think the course will be completed either because the last video was around one year ago and I don't think he is in the mood to complete this course so the course is not at all complete and you will be and you'll end up waiting for more content which will which might never come so this is one huge disadvantage of taking the course but it is still very good resource it's still a very good resource for learning things like Java and recursion binary search sorting algorithms Etc these are things that you can learn from his course but the course is not complete not at all complete and you cannot rely on this course for everything so you can learn certain things from his course but you cannot learn it for the entirety of your DSA preparation so if you're learning Java you can follow some of his videos to ex to understand things more better but this is not one course that you can take and then everything will be done for you so that's a main disadvantage of Kunal kushwaha's course then next up we have Apna college so Apna college is one of the most requested courses a lot of people were asking me about Apna College DSE course whether they should take it or not swapna college has a C plus plus course for data sections and algorithm the courses on C plus plus I think they also have a course in Java but it is ongoing and this course I think is complete right so this course is in C plus plus and they have 226 videos so the course is pretty much complete so let me write complete first and the course is good you can take it like all it's also beginner friendly so if you can take this course if you're a beginner and the entire Apna College channel is very beginner friendly which is one great thing about the channel but the disadvantage is that the quality is not the best okay so this is something I should tell you that quality according to me is not up to mark okay so like you have other courses the quality is good great but in this the quality is not the best that you can find so the quality is not the best especially when you have other good courses and comparison so this is a course with a quality especially for the advanced topics like recursion Etc the quality is not up to Mark you'll have some trouble understanding their videos and it's not really the best that is out there but like I said it is complete it is beginner friendly you can definitely take it but quality is not up to mark for let me say for more advanced topic so again for more advanced topic you might end up getting confused or stuck foreign topics so again in this course it is complete it is beginner friendly but I would say that it is not the best course out there there is some lack in quality but uh yeah you can still try it you might like it but according to me the quality is not really the best then we have code with Harry so to be very honest I didn't even know that code with Harry had a DSA playlist I only knew him for development and let me tell you beforehand only that code with Harry is like the goat of development so code with Harry has one of the best playlist on web development and other Development Area and I used to follow him in college a lot of people follow him and have benefited from his course so code with Harry is the like legit goat of development especially web development his his web development courses are the best that you will find but his DSA course is not the best so if DC course is also good it's there's nothing bad in it but it's not the best that you can find one disadvantage of his course is that he has notes in the course okay so he has notes in the course and it's also in C and C plus plus so it's in C and C plus plus it comes with notes and the quality is good there's nothing wrong with the quality but the disadvantage is that it's not complete okay so he has not covered topics like Daniel programming recursion backtracking so again this is not a course that you can rely on you can look at these videos for certain references but the course is not complete and again it's not the best out there he has the best content on web development and Development Area but for DSA it's not the best that you can find so code with Harry's course you can take for certain references but it's not complete and you cannot fully rely on it also the course is in C and C plus plus so the one advantage which I liked was that he provided notes at the end of his videos so that's code with Harry for you and I think that's pretty much it I've covered everything that was asked for me and I've been very Frank about everything I've been very critical about everything because I don't like to sugarcoat things because I don't want you to waste your time a lot of these other YouTubers what they do when they review these courses they try not to be critical they try not to say anything wrong about the course the bad about something bad about the course but what I feel is that your time is valuable so I don't want to sugarcoat anything so based on this you can decide which course that you can take which course is the best suited for you and one thing that I'm going to tell you no matter which course you take you're gonna have to work hard on yourself and you're gonna have to solve a lot of problems so these two things you're gonna have to do no matter what course you take but these are the things that I wanted to say about each of these goals so in nutshell love purpose course is pretty great it's in C plus plus it's complete it's beginner friendly it's very much beginner friendly and the disadvantage is that there's not much variety of problems anatipayas course is again complete and the disadvantage is that it is not very vast and it only focuses more on classical problems take you forward has one of the best content one of the best course and the disadvantage is that it's not completely beginner friendly Kunal kushwa is again is having great quality but it's not at all complete Apna College it's complete it's beginner friendly it's good but quality is not the best especially for advanced topic code with Harry is the goat of development but not for DSM but still you can take his course and you can definitely take a look at his notes and you can take it for revision as well so yeah that's pretty much it I think I've covered everything and the video has gone on for longer than I anticipated so if you're still having doubts you can comment it on the video and I'll be sure to get back to you and you can even try some of the videos out from each of the course to see which one suits the best for you but yeah if in case there's anything let me know in the comments I'll be sure to answer thank you

yeah so good evening everyone in the last videos I think we started so actual syllabus which is nothing but sample algorithms and implementation of those algorithms okay so as a part of that we have seen some programs like how to develop these program programs so step by step I explain what is the first program that we covered how we can able to calculate addition of two numbers in this program the total code I have written within the main method and I execute it the second program so how to check whether the given number is even number or odd number for that we implemented a method like static method which is going to return a string called even number if the number is divisible with otherwise it is going to return odd number like that we implemented a method for that okay next maximum of two numbers so we we have defined a method which is going to take two numbers and it is going to written maximum among those two numbers sir how many versions We implemented for these three versions one is nothing but the standard approach by using IF conditions how you can able to do that second one Max function by using second version where we are going to take conditional operator based on that conditional operator so it is going to return either true or false and third one we implemented Max function by taking the predefined method called math. Max there is a predefined method called Max which is present in math class by using that how to implement I explained very clearly in the last sessions so by using that how to calculate minimum of two numbers how to calculate maximum of three numbers how to calculate minimum of three numbers sir these are the things which we covered in the last videos okay now as a part of continuation for this we have to go for the next Pro program so what is the next program in this we have here is yeah so Max and Min of up to three numbers we covered now we have to see maximum and minimum of four numbers let us take that implementation so first I'm going to find out maximum of four numbers how to calculate can I take the same program yes okay so I'm going to implement by using three versions in addition to A and B and C we have to take one more input which is nothing but a d it will ask the user to enter D value we are reading the D value how many values we have to pass four values we have to pass I'm passing a b c and the D at the time of receiving also okay so we have to receive how many values so four values we have received and then based on that we need to implement so the number of levels is going to increase right in the previous example since we are calculating um maximum of three numbers we have taken two conditions for this purpose now how many conditions we have to take three conditions we have to take so first we are comparing the first number with the second number first number with the third number and first number with fourth number if all these conditions are true we have to return a otherwise we have to compare B with c and we have to compare B with d if true we are going to return B otherwise we have to compare C with d if it is true we have to return C so if all these conditions are not satisfied we are going to return the value of D like that we have so what is a second way in the version two sir what I'm going to do is so I'm taking total four parameters so here in the conditional operator again I'm applying the nested so a is greater than b sorry somewhere yeah correct a is greater than b a is greater than C and A is greater than d means a is the biggest number otherwise so we have to check one more condition like B is greater than C and B is greater than b if it is true B is the biggest number otherwise what will happen we have to compare C and D based on that either C or D we have to print so what about next one so here also we are taking four inputs from the user so already math. Max is taking two parameters in addition to that I'm going to pass C comma D since four values are there so first two values I'm passing to the math. max function remaining two values I'm passing to the other function these two functions are going to return two individual values so those two again I'm comparing by using Max method in this case what will happen it will return maximum value in between A and B that value is going to be compared with math. Max of C comma that's all beyond that nothing so the total program is clear if you run the program you can see sir what output they are expecting one second it is taking time yeah enter a value I'm giving 1 2 3 4 so what is the output that we are getting maximum is four so if you run the program so by taking 1 2 3 minus 4 maximum is nothing but three so if I'm giving so 1 2 - 3 - 4 maximum is 2 so if I'm running so 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 maximum is one so all possible combinations all possible combinations are working perfectly this is the way how we can able to calculate maximum of how many numbers four numbers in the same way you can calculate minimum of four numbers I think no need to explain this logic you can able to solve directly what modification we have to do where ever greater than is there so in that place you have to replace with less than okay here also less than and here also less than sir I request you to please implement this program so here also less than so here also less than and here also less than everywhere wherever greater than symbol is there try to use less than symbol so next in the place of math. Max so you have to take math. so in the place of math. Max take math.min here also you have to take math.min okay so next and after that wherever the word Max is there so there we need to replace that's all except that remaining things are same sir okay this is the way how you can able to calculate maximum and minimum of four numbers sir the main idea behind uh the explanation of this program is you can able to solve different kind of methods different versions will be there once if the numbers are increasing how to take the levels how to check multiple conditions all these things I demonstrated in these four programs so that's all sir if you are getting biggest of five numbers or six numbers I think now you are in a position to define a separate method for that requirement sir please confirm is the concept is clear up to this whatever I covered yes please confirm yes sir good so next one next concept sir the next program what we we have here swapping of two integer values I want to implement a program to perform swapping of two integer values okay so swapping off two integer values so how to implement this swapping logic swapping means what interchanging the values so first I will write the driver code so later I will implement the methods so in this example I'm going to read two inputs from the user the first input is a and the second input is B I'm reading two integer values from the user and what is those two integers the first integer is nothing but a second integer is nothing but B I accepted two integer values So based on these we have to calculate biggest sorry swapping of these two numbers so we have different versions are there for this also I'm taking swap version one sir where I'm going to pass two parameters like a comma B so I will Implement a function public static wide so swap version one it is receiving two parameters like a and b sir first initially I'm trying to print so swap swapping off so swapping off two integer values using using version one like this I'm printing by using first version so before that so I will try to print the values sir before swapping okay before swap what is the value of a yes sir and what is the value of B this is the value of B like this sir before performing swapping operation what is the value of a and what is the the value of B both I'm trying to print here so I will write some instructions so after performing spping operation so what will be the value of a and b so here we have to implement the logic the first version is nothing but by using so temporary variable I'm taking a temporary variable concept to implement this means what I will declare one temporary variable sir temp is equal to a equal to b b is equal to Temp like this I'm taking sir how it is going to work listen friends so consider the initial value of a which I have given is nothing but three and the value of B which I have given is two so first time what will happen a memory location will be created so to hold the value three let us consider the name of the memory location is a content is three now one more memory location is created with name B and the content is two so we created one more variable called temp this is nothing but the temporary memory location what we have now observe the lines in the first line what we are doing we are copying the content of a into temp see it is a assignment operation always it will be evaluated from right to left so the value of a is going to be copied into temp so what is the value of a three right that value will be copied into temp yes in the temp we have now three so now a is equal to B I taking means what we are copying the value of B into a what is the value of b sir two sir that value we have to copy to a so already in the a some content is there don't worry it will perform which operation overriding Operation so now what is the next line B is equal Al to Temp sir temporary value is having three that value will be updated to B so now if you print what is the content of a sir is it two or not yes what is the content of B three have you observed so these three lines are doing which operation swapping operation okay so this is nothing but the first version what we have by using temporary variable how you can able to swap so now I'm going to run the program you can see so sir enter a value I'm giving so two and then so enter B value I'm giving three so now you can able to see the output swapping of integer values by using version one before swapping a value is two and B value is three after swapping a value is three B value is two sir perfectly it is working so friends please confirm do you you have any doubt in this swap version one function please confirm everyone please confirm is it clear right good sir so some people are not at all giving response maybe you are sleeping so now I want to implement this with another version okay so what is that version is a second version so now I will hide the first version because uh already we implemented right just I'm putting in a comment so now like this I'm going to define the second version second version sir in the second version what we are doing is by using by using addition and fraction I want to implement I am not going to use any temporary variable here without using any temporary variable and by using addition and subtraction okay by using addition and subtraction I'm trying to implement this code sir how to do that very simple sir if you want you can see so no need to declare any temporary variable here just I'm going to take sir a is equal to a + b okay a is equal to a + b sir B is equal to a minus B okay then a is equal to a minus B like this we have three lines of code is there don't worry friends I will take one example and I will demonstrate how it is going to work okay now listen sir consider the value of a is equal to I'm taking five and the value of B is equal to I'm taking four remember these are the initial values sir what is the first line a is equal to boss what is the value of a so it is nothing but five plus 4 so now the latest value of a is nothing but what n sir okay then so what is the next line B is equal to a minus b sir what is the latest value of a 9 minus what is the latest value of B 4 so what will be the result five B value is five now a is equal to what is the latest value of a 9 what is the latest value of B5 9 - 5 will become four that I'm copying to a now you can see what is the latest value of a four previously it is five now what is the latest value of B5 previously it is four like that the values got interchanged sir it is nothing but what by using version two let us run the code and check really is it happen happening or not so if you run the program it is asking enter a value I'm giving 10 and I'm giving 80 now you can see before swapping it is a 10 and 80 so after swapping it is nothing but what 80 and 10 like that we can able to Interchange the values between these variables okay friends please confirm is this second version of this program is it clear for you people sir please confirm everyone clear up to this right so this is nothing but second version what we have so we have another two or three versions are there let me talk about that so what is the next version here is sir I'm hiding this and I need to implement one more version like swap version okay swap version three sir where I will pass a comma b sir what is this version three let us copy paste for the skeleton okay now I'm taking swap version three now observe swapping of two integer values by using version three so by using we can take by using multiplication and division also okay I'm taking the help of multiplication and division to implement this operation let us see what will be the formula sir a equal to a into B A is equal to a by b sir a is equal to a by that's all this is the formula by using which we can able to swap two integer values so I will show you with the help of diagram so that you can able to feel comfortable okay let us take a is equal to I'm taking one or let me take four and B is equal to I'm taking 3 so now a is equal to so a into b a value is 4 B value is three okay so before swapping we have 4 three so a is equal to 4 B is equal to 3 which will become 12 so what is the latest value of a it is 12 sir now B is equal to I'm taking a by b a value is a 12 by B value is nothing but three your result will become four so now B value is four then what is the third line a is equal to a by B your latest value of a is 12 by 4 is nothing but three that value will be updated here now what is the a value three what is the B value four sir is the values got is the values got interchanged or not yes this is the way how we can able to Interchange the values between A and B okay friends I think you people got clear idea how we can able to perform these operations sir is the swapping with logic three by using multiplication and division is it clear for everyone yes guys please respond yes sir right sir next one so I think I didn't executed let me I think executed right so I executed this program right third version right so now I'm taking fourth version so I'm putting comments for this and I'm taking so swap version 4 so where I will take a comma B so what is this fourth version sir very simple if you take version 4 so swapping of two integer values by using version four by using by using I'm taking here bitwise operators okay I'm taking bitwise operators what is a Formula a isal to a cap B A is Bal to a cap B again a is equal to a cap B so the right side formula is the same left side it is going to change sir how this formula is going to work don't worry the people who are having idea about bitwise operators you people get full-fledged Clarity remaining people just have a look once okay you will get some idea so what I'm doing here is If You observe so what is the formula sir can I say a is equal to a cap B okay sir B is equal to a cap B again a is equal to I'm taking a cap this is nothing but the formula sir how you can able to implement this very simple if you take the value of a is equal to 5 we have to convert this a value into binary number sir because you know very well bitwise operators are going to work only with the help of binary operators so now 8421 terminology I'm taking so 8421 this is the binary equivalent for the number five now I'm taking another another number called 9 so what is its equivalent sir 842 1 like this we have so this is a value this is B value now we have to apply this logic now see what will happen sir a is equal to a cap b sir what is the a value in terms of binary we have to write 0 1 0 1 and then 1 0 1 like this we have so what is the result first of all you should know what cap operation is going to do sir if both bits are one or if both bits are zero then result is zero if one bit is zero another bit is one if one bit is zero another bit is one in these two cases result will become one so now what will happen 0 1 it will become one 1 0 it will become one 0 0 0 0 0 0 this is nothing but the latest value of a sir what is the latest value of a can I say is it one0 like this we have 1 0 so excellent up to this no problem now what is the second line again we have to calculate B is equal to a cap what is the a value latest value we have to take 1 0 okay what is the latest value of a sir it is nothing but 1 0 1 now apply again the principle 1 1 you will get zero so 1 0 you'll get one 0 0 0 0 1 1 so this is nothing but the latest value of which one so B value 0 1 0 1 like this we have now again we have to take a is equal to what is the latest value of a sir sir can I say is it one0 what is the latest value of b sir it is 0 1 0 1 again apply cap operation here you'll get 1 0 0 1 this is nothing but the latest value of a so now reconvert this yes reconvert this sir what is its decimal equivalent it is n what is its decimal equivalent it is five have you observed before it is five now it is n before it is n now it is five not only for small numbers even you can take negative numbers also it will work I think behind the screen I think you can see uh negative numbers means something like two's complement terminology will be there based on that it will execute okay sir this is nothing but logic behind this program what is happening sir can I test this code yes now let us run so I'm giving five and then nine so before by using version one before swapping a value is five b value is 9 after swapping a value is 9 B value is five sir same example I have taken here to demonstrate this sir everyone please is confirm are you feeling comfortable with this concept can I know sir your your voice is low sir can you please speak clearly yes sir how can I know that bit value of p is 0 1 01 uh sir compulsory you should know uh this conversion process because it is a standard mathematical thumb rule how to convert a decimal number into binary binary into decimal if you don't know just ignore this example I mean this case we have bit manipulations chapter is there in our data structures itself there I will explain in detail okay sir okay right so remaining people please confirm clear up to this friends good right sir so next one the last version what we have here so I'm taking so swap version five where I'm passing a comma B values so what is this fifth version of course last version by using single line by using single line we can able to decide here okay so here I'm going to take by using single line statement by using single line single line statement we can write so what is that single line a is equ Al to okay a is equal to A + B minus B is equal to a like this a statement is there so how it is going to work suppose if a value is equal to 1 and B value is equal to 2 sir a is equal to a + b a value is 1 B value is 2 it will become 3 minus sir B is equal to a what is the a value 1 okay so first this one will be copied to B now your latest value of B will become one so now a is equal to 3 - 1 your result will become two what value that is a have you observed is The Interchange is happened or not yes now let us run this program and check by using version five now I'm giving the input as a 10 and then 11 you can see by using the version file before swapping 101 after swapping 1110 like that we can able to Interchange the values between two two two variables by using different kinds of Logics okay sir you may have a doubt we covered totally five versions among these five versions which version is efficient as per theoretical knowledge all the versions are same because we are not using any if conditions okay we are not using any Loops no extra space is required except first method so remaining all the four methods are almost same but sir when compared with all these five the method where we used bitwise operators is going to work efficiently the reason for that is bitwise operators are going to work efficiently because it is going to work directly with the binary numbers okay so I think you will get more clarity when I'm explaining in The bitwise Operators I mean bit manipulations chapter as of now just remember which one is going to give the efficiency sir the method which we implemented by using bitwise operators is going to work effectively friends is the concept is clear this whatever we covered yes clear but sir which method will give the best space complexity space wise sir first except first method remaining methods are almost the same right in the first method one extra temporary variable we are taking in all the methods we are not taking any temporary variable okay so except first method remaining all the methods are having same space complexity the space complexity generally it won't that much matter sir because you know very well nowadays space is not that much important okay so whenever you are storing the data in a permanent storage area then only space must be required in other cases automatically these high level languages are having the facilities to destroy the objects automatically whenever it is useless so uh if you want to manage the memory efficient better to invoke the garbage collector automatically it will destroy the objects so it won't take that much importance in the calculation of uh I mean analysis of algorithms so mainly we will focus on time not space got it got it got it sir clear everyone so that we can go for Next program right next what is the next program here is I want to calculate sum of N natural numbers okay I'm going to give one n value suppose if I'm giving n is equal to 5 what is your requirement 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 this value we have to calculate and you need to print the result this is nothing but your requirement sir how to how to do this very simple I'm implementing the program okay in three different versions enter n value enter n value assume I'm going to accept the data in the form of n now sir I'm going to uh invoke this function system.out.println so Su value is nothing but uh sumore version one where I'm going to give input as a n so public static integer so sum version one and we are taking one integer so what is the first method that we have here okay to calculate sum of N natural numbers is we have mathematical formula is there by using that mathematical formula we can able to return return anyone can you please tell me what is that mathematical formula sir n into n + 1 by 2 sir good directly I'm going to return n into n + 1 by 2 that's all automatically it will calculate sir we have another version is also there to implement this program what is the another version that we have here is so version two I'm taking okay so where public static integer so some version which is going to take the integer in now listen carefully here I'm going to use looping statement concept so so I'm declaring One initial value like sum is equal to Z and I'm taking a loop which will start from zero and it will run up to n so every time what I'm going to do is I'm taking sum is equal to Su plus I at last I will return the value of s how it is going to work internally if you see the initial value of sum is equal to Z assume the value of n which I have given is five how how many times the loop is going to run sir Loop is going to run for zero that zero will be added to some so 0 plus Z will become zero that I am updating to the sum then your I value will become one okay so already previous sum is 0 0 plus current I value is 1 0 + 1 will become 1 so then I'm taking I equal to 2 so current value is nothing but 2 + 1 2 + 1 will become 3 okay so next I value will become 3 so 3 + 3 will become 6 then your I value will become 4 so 6 + 4 will become uh 10 okay then I is equal to 5 sir 10 + 5 will become 15 then I will become six automatically the loop is going to stop because it is not less than five okay less than or equal to five that's all this is nothing but the second version what we have okay let me run these two versions up to this whatever I covered now it is asking enter n value I'm giving five you can see in both cases it is rning the output as a 15 so perfectly working in both cases okay friends is this two two versions of this program is it clear for you people clear clear sir right so the next one what we have here is sir I want to implement by using recursion right now see sir in the third version what I'm going to do is by using recursion I'm implementing so I think uh you can't able to understand this but don't worry just see my explanation that is sufficient anyway we have recursion chapter is there there we are going to cover minimum 15 to 20 examples I'm going to explain you people are going to get full-fledged Clarity on that okay sir first I'm going to check is the number is equal to zero then automat ically we can stop otherwise I'm going to return n plus some version 3 I'm calling for n minus one just see my explanation sir don't go beyond that okay sir initially initially consider the value of n which we have given is five so first we are calling some function by passing input as a five it is going to check is the number whatever you have given is equal to zero no no then n plus that means how it is going to be evaluated 5 5+ sir again some function we are calling byp passing 5 minus 1 which will become four so now again this function is going to be executed so now this value will be stored inside the stack and four plus again it will be called for 4 - 1 3 again it will be called for sir 3 plus 3 - 1 2 again it will be called for 2 + 2 - 1 1 again it will be called for 1 + 1 - 1 0 do you know whenever you are getting the number as a zero which value we are rning zero we are not calculating simply we are rning so this value is going to be returned by zero 0 + 1 1 is the result so when we called this function it is executed right that's why 1 + 0 is 1 this value is written here sir 2 + 1 3 is written here okay sir 3 + 3 6 value is written here sir 6 + 4 10 value is written here sir 10 + 5 who called this for them it is going to return which value sir 15 have you oberved is it our result or not yes but internally where that values will be stored how it is going to work in the recursion part I will explain friends please confirm is this explanation is it clear for you people yes everyone please confirm yes sir yes sir right now let me run the program by giving all these cases whether it is working or not if the input is a five okay if the input is a five in all these three versions the output is 15 if input is if input is zero okay yeah so if input is zero in all these three these cases it is zero okay so if input is 100 in all these three cases 50 is the result this is the way how we can able to calculate sum of N natural numbers how many versions We implemented for this almost three versions We implemented okay so this is nothing but what we have in today's session okay sir uh with this I'm going to stop today's class so in this data structures and algorithms we started with basic fundamentals so sample algorithms and implementations we started and we are at the middle so remaining programs we will continue from Monday after that so I will start okay so array data structure and after that analysis of algorithms introduction part everything we will cover okay

hello everyone welcome to another interesting session of your favorite YouTube channel my project ideas we are working on the GSA course and today's topic is trailing zeros in a factorial in the last lecture I already told you what are factorials and we wrote some very interesting codes then we found out the efficient algorithm as well we learned about factorial but in this lecture we'll be moving a step further we'll be learning the trailing zeros in a factorial so first a question might pop up in your mind that what is a trailing zero because you know what are factorials but what what do I mean by trailing zeros so a tra tailing zero means basically the zero which appears at the end of a number after you find out the factorial suppose for an example you have a number eight I have given you a number eight and I ask you to find out the trailing zeros number of trailing zeros in the factorial of 8 so first your job is to find out the factorial of8 so it's 8 into 7 into 6 into 5 up to one the answer you get is 40 3 2 0 and the number of trailing zeros is one got it next so I have given here three inputs input is five 20 and 100 just don't look at the answer and comment down your answers your take on the number of trailing zeros if I give you the input five 20 and 100 nothing to do just find out the factorial of five find out the factorial of 20 and find out the factorial of 100 see you cannot find out the factorial of 100 manually so write down a code like I told you in the last lecture how to write the code of the factorial write down the code you will get the answer of 100 the input 100 and then calculate the number of tring zeros okay I hope you have done this small task now what are the approaches that we are going to work on we are going to work on two approaches one is naive approach and one is efficient approach so what is naive approach naive approach is basically a Playman approach which is not efficient which everybody does so what is a I approach simple method first calculate the factorial of n then count the number of triling zeros and normally everyone will think of this but this approach has a problem factorial of a number can be very big at sometimes like if I to tell you to calculate the factorial of 100 it can be very very very long and this can create overflow okay so it's a bit of a problem for that reason we are learning DSA right so let's find out the efficient approach how do you do so you know that a zero can be formed by the factors of two and five because 2 multiplied by 5 is 10 so a factor of like suppose four the number four two is a factor of four and the number 25 five is a factor of 25 so 4 into 25 is 100 produced some triling zeros so if there are more factors of two than five in N factorial the number of zeros will be determined by the number of timeses five is a factor of the number because five is very crucial while you want to calculate or while you want to get a zero in the number so how do you calculate the number of Fes so count how many multiples of five are there in the range 1 to n first in the range 1 to n if you have a number n just find out that how many multiples of five are there in that number so count the higher so the simple trick is count the higher powers of five like 25 125 because every number which is a power of five will contribute some other factors of five or some additional factors of five some uh like some more numbers of five so it will give more number of trilling zeros so I know it was a bit tough don't worry look at this example it will be very clear to you suppose I've given you a number n which is 100 what you need to do first divide 100 by 5 so you get 20 so you got 20 factors of five then what you have to do divide 100 by 25 that is higher power of five you get four but if you divide it by 125 it will not contribute anything because it will exceed 100 so 100 by 125 will come in decimal so 20 + 24 will be uh 20 + 4 will give rise to 24 got it so now we'll have a look at the code before that I think I have done some spelling error here okay issues simple right you can figure out that okay we are done then let's have a look at the code here I have made a file separate file for you to find out the trailing zero see before I write the code do one thing you just try to write down The Code by yourself and jot down your code in the comment section and uh let's have a look how many of you are actually with me in this so okay we writing it in Python so first let's define a function find railing zero and we take a number n as input if n is less than Z this is basically a negative number case okay so we return minus one then we do the count see in Python indentation is very important very very important count is equal to zero have like you have to like write the indentation very carefully then why n / I is greater than equal to one let's go inside the loop I'm doing it right okay then let's increment the count variable then let's because we are finding out the factors of five let's check factors of five after which we return count because I told you that we are working on the factors of five so higher factors of five I gave you the example now let's move to the main function move to the next line indentation is perfect if down the function name is dou equal to main these things are clear to you right I think big mean this is this is basically my driver code okay then n is equal to suppose 100 I have to print the trailing zeros of 100 so let me write down a printing statement count [Music] ofing zeros in put a comma here and let me put a comma here n because we are finding out the number of pring zeros in N factorial so let me write down a factorial here then is and we return return our function find reing zeros finding zero and in this give n as your input okay I hope you're good to go let's run it so it says count of trailing zeros in 100 is 20 so I hope you understood the working of this code for more interesting project ideas stay tuned to this channel thank you and have a great day and happy learning [Music]

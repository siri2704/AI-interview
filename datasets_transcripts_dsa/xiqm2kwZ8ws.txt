[Music] welome students welcome to Academy dat structure dat structure example types of data structure abstract data type structure abstract data type or sets abstract data typ for AR data structure the data structure can be defined as the collection of elements and all the possible operations which are required for those set of elements El elements op so first for example consider a set of elements which are required to store in AR 3 2 5 El Indo IND El one IND two IND El thir IND so element structure reading the elements so for example next elements from the El delete elements from the array types of data structure next typ of data structures so data structure first type of primitive data structure non primitive data structure primtive dat struct character float character float characters letters values data data structure nonlinear data structure a sequential sequ sequence sequence arranged for example list stack nonl dat hierarch arange for example Tre dat structures SC next abstract data type abstract data type either shter a d type for objects whose behavior is defined by set of values and a set of operations set of values set of operations the definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how operations will be implemented okay so mention one what operations are to be performed and but not how these operations will be implemented application progam l abstract data type so abstract data type is a type for objects Behavior operations what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented it does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithm will be used for implementing the operations abstraction so it does not specify how data will be organized in memory memory private functions private the process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction dat next operations various ad operations the first one create in the ad next display dat element El next inser next deletion so database so deletion next so this operation modifies the desired elements value by any desired new value so so various operations create display insert delete modify so the five operations ad operations screens next topic next for set so abstract data type structure if we want to write ad for a set of integers then we will use the following method meod structure starting abstract data type so a capital letter D capital letter Capal starting type of stru element 1 2 3 dot dot dot so first instances step one abstract datae structure is a collection of integer type of elements num next PRS pre po pre posts operations store this operation is for storing the integer element in a list in a set sorry so set next retrieve this operation is for retrieving the desired element from the given set the first operation second operation third next display operation this operation is for displaying the contents of the set struct next next abstract data type for arrays or array if we want to write for an array then we will use the following method 5 1 2 2 element IND 0 1 2 3 4 so El abstract data type a capital letter D capital letter T capital letter so type of starting with curly bracket and end with curly bracket so open close so first for step of some index I IND total number of elements in the list one store this operation stores the desired elements at each successive location successive operations next display function this operation display the elements of the AR strength success Clarity wam

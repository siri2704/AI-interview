hey everyone come back to the channel I hope you guys are doing extremely well today's video is going to be extremely important because I'm going to talk about the current Generations obsession with solving 500 or more lead code problems wherever I see they're like I've sold 500 I've sold 800 I've sold thousand that is what we are going to talk about in this video so I'm not sure if you know me or not so during my time I did intern at Amazon after that I joined media.net as a software engineer and for guys who know media.net they know how tough other interviews at media.net after that I went on to clear interviews of Facebook and Google and currently I'm working at Google so I've seen this basa like I've seen this DSA era entirely in and out so I know how much is required and I've been seeing this pattern lately that people are just running behind those numbers and that is what I will be talking about in this video I understand numbers give you dopamine but you need to use your brain wisely because time is critical like you cannot just waste your time just to increase those numbers to decorate your profile because at the end of the day what matters is your first skill set so what we will be talking about in this video is the things that you need to do and the things that you do not need to do when you are using lead code for your interview prep Point number one do not solve problems that you know you can that is very very important what I've seen is people know the solution of a problem they still type the code and just click on the summit because they want to see that accepted thing dude what are you doing you're not upskilling yourself you're just satisfying your ego that yes I did solve it actually you didn't you already had solved that problem that is why you are able to solve that problem in one go you only solve problems for which you don't know the solution you only solve problem for which you do not know if the solution will work or not any problem that you know that hey I have solved this problem or I know that the solution is definitely going to work avoid it keep it move ahead that is what you need to do before my Amazon internship interview the number of problems I did was overall 250 on lead code but I made sure those were quality problems so it's important that you solve quality problems that you cannot solve on the first go or that you like you're not sure of the optimal solution only those problems are the ones that you should solve and please do not solve for the sake of the numbers so the competition rising up solving problems alone is not going to help you you will need to build projects you'll need to give mock interviews your resume has to be polished enough and you will be requiring referrals when the time is there so what I'll recommend you is to check out freeplace because they have some amazing mentors why am I talking about mentors because everyone yes everyone has their personalized query where they're struggling from something or something else and they need a personalized roadmap and this is where the mentors come in they will be sitting with you they'll be hearing all your doubts and after that they'll be preparing you a personalized roadmap you can follow that road map and every week they'll be checking up on you hey did you do it hey did you do it and when someone is watching trust me you tend to perform a lot better once you're prepared once you have done all your projects after that they'll be helping you with mock interview so that that before the interview you get a Vibe of how the interviews are after that they will be polishing your resume once you're done with that they'll also be helping you with reference because most of the engineers have a good friend Circle as well so what are you waiting for book a free trial session with the mentor of your choice right now at pre-placed don't forget to use Thrive 1000 in order to get extra thousand credits Point number two try learning topics pattern wise what I've seen is people want to learn a topic that is great what they do is they go over lead code or any other platform they give the topic binary search and the sorted by easy medium hard they start solving all the easy ones then they go to medium then they go too hard they end up solving 100 150 problems and most of them are repeating patterns it's not required there is not necessary what you need to do is you need to identify patterns for an example a topic like binary search it has probably 10 or 12 patterns what you need to do is you need to cover these 10 or 12 patterns for every pattern if you need two problems if you need three if you need four whatever number of problems you need till you understand that pattern in depth it might happen for a pattern in binary search unit 4 for a pattern in my research you might need one to understand it in depth the moment you understand that pattern in depth move ahead just do not solve like keep solving problems just because you enjoy that pattern it's important to finish up or wrap up the topics quickly like I made this binary search playlist what I did was I made it pattern wise so that you understand it in depth and you can solve any of the problems so please do not solve problems by just giving topic names it is good when you're revising but when you are learning it's important to be quick because you need to do a lot of other things as well Point number three participate in contest why am I saying it I've seen this common Trend whoever is solving 500 800 000 1500 whatever is the number most of them are not participating in contests and at the end of the day whenever they're going to the coding rounds they're struggling need to understand one thing that in India the difficulty level is slightly tougher because the com competition is enormous so you have to be at your best you cannot say that okay I'll get the interview and I'll clear it in order to get that interview they're like thousands of people appearing for an opening so you have to be prepared for that coding round and nowadays the coding rounds are getting tougher and tougher so that is why participating in contest is very critical what are coding rounds it's a closed environment with unknown questions with a timer how can you replicate that how can you practice that environment the best way is to participate in contest just opening a lead code problem and solving it you're not under that pressure moment right you're not under that pressure of the time time of ticking up so you gotta you need to practice so that is why please please participate in contest and after the contest is finished please of solve the problems that you were not able to because this is how you'll understand if you are able to apply those Concepts or not and whichever concepts are still weak try to solve more and more problems on that instead of solving random problems and like increasing your number count got it Point number four try to diversify topics as much as you can why am I saying that I've seen a lot of profiles that have solved like 500 800 Lead code problems but when I go over the profile I see that the topics specifically the advanced topics like grab DP trees try they haven't solved a lot of problems on it so I I get a notion that people are solving a lot of problems but they're solving something like a binary search arrays linked list the upper like the easy medium section A lot but when it comes to the harder like advanced concepts they're kind of backing up so it's critical that when you're picking up a topic don't get into this notion that I'm gonna learn it entirely search because you can never learn a topic entirely you can never learn anything entirely on this planet so if you're picking up binary search assume you have seen my entire playlist it's fine it's time to move on you will be tested when you're giving contest the moment you give contest you'll find the problem on binary search if you cannot solve absolve and that is how you learn you just cannot stick to binary search for six months you gotta move to Advanced topics so try to diversify topics as much as you can try touching all the topics because that is important having a well Diversified number on all the topics is like that is what will matter because when you go to interviews you're not going to be asked on binary search or arrays Only You Can Be asked on any topic and for that you should be knowing that topic in order to at least give it a try so that is why Try diversifying topics do not look at numbers just keep solving at the end of one year you will see that the numbers are good if you look at your profile they will be great solving it for the purpose of the numbers it won't help you upskill so if you want quality problems pattern wise and on all the topics you should definitely check out strivos A to Z DSA course I'll be leaving out the link in the description you get video Solutions as well you get the Articles as well you get the C plus plus Java python JavaScript code as well and that is all you will be requiring for your interview prep along with DSA getting your projects done is important as well so do not miss out on that aspect and if possible do get a mentor who will be reviewing your as you may will be taking your mock interviews we'll be pushing you every now and then check out pre-place for some amazing mentors the link will be in the description with this let's wrap up this video and meet in some other video till then bye bye take care [Music] [Music] thank you

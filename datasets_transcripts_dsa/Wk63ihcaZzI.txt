how to learn data structures and algorithm the best way coding is a journey and I am saying this because at times you will find yourself starting at a piece of code that is written in an alien language and it happens with almost every coder out there learning data structure and algorithm is the secret behind making a code not just functional but brilliant but why is DSA crucial in 2024 DSA is the backbone of any software engineering Ro whatever you want to work for Google or a hot startup DSA is a must but why the answer is because it solves complex problems efficiently it is not about writing code that works it about writing code that will scale perform well and also be maintainable and in 2024 knowing DSA is not just are nice to have skill it is nonnegotiable firstly get your Basics right AR linkless stack trees and graphs these are your bread and butter you need to understand how they work and why they matter and yes please do learn about Big O notations it's how you'll measure the efficiency of your algorithm and it's what will make your code stand out in those intense coding interview now you know the basics how do you actually learn DSA trust me it's not by binge watching tutorials I agree they are helpful but they are not enough you need to start somewhere start with simple problems and gradually take on more complex ones and if you get stuck don't be afraid to Peak at the solution but don't rely on it on one of the most effective strategies is visualization use diagrams and flow charts to see how the data moves to your algorithm TOS like visual algo or even a simple pen and paper can be Lifesaver always remember that the way an algorithm works is more important than just knowing how to code it implement this algorithm in your preferred language write code debug it and optimize it now you will see that conscious will turn into skills you will be in need of some tools and resources but where do you find the best of them books like introduction to algorithms and cracking the code interview are good but they are not enough explored platforms like scholar heart lead code hacker rank or code forces for practice communities can also help you so join forums Reddit threads or even Discord groups where you can discuss problems on loan this is building system that work in real world suppose you are on a search engine knowing the right search algorithm will help you sear quickly the point is that the DSA has real world applications it can solve actual problems in your project DS is not easy but it can be tough sometimes you will hit walls get frustrated and want to give up but it's a part of the process sometimes a fresh perspective is what you need remember the stack Overflow is your friend and so are coding communities you may have heard of the 10,000 R rule right but you might not need exactly 10,000 hours to master D you need a regular practice to test your progress is you can participate in coding competitions even if you are not aiming to win the real Victory is in learning you will have to practice more and more it will make you better to apply it under pressure the world of algorithm is constantly evolving uh what was cutting edge a few years ago might be outdated today so you need to keep yourself updated for that you can follow te blogs attend webinars and keep an eye on the new research paper reading about them will not be enough you'll need to implement new algorithm test them and see how they stack against the classics DSA will be your goto skill set so keep learning and stay curious and remember every line of code you WR is a step towards becoming a better developer

four things to keep in mind during DSA interview round first your introduction so try to give short increased introduction within one to two minutes so try to finish your introduction in one to two minutes and the second one is explanation of any one of the past project so try to explain one of the best project only one project try to explain only one project in detail within five to ten minutes so don't give more than 5 to 10 minutes to the project and the third one is very important that is your coding questions so they can ask message to DSA coding questions so try to give 20 minutes for each coding question so that you can approach you can give different solutions and you can come to the optimal solution and the fourth one is behavior questions so either they can skip or they can ask the behavioral questions so try to answer this also very quickly so do subscribe for more thank you

hello everyone today we are learning the topic about um sum of digits for a given number uh it is a data stretch up problem so they will give the uh give they will give an integer number then what you have to do is we have to calculate the sum of each digit in that integer number and you have to give the sum as output that means here the input is 1 3 so you will calculate 1 + 3 and we have to generate the output as four the number can be any digits maybe it can be u 2 2 3 three number also then you have to calculate the uh sum like this 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 so 3 + 3 9 2 + 2 is 4 4 + 9 is 30 so you have to give the output as 133 so this is the uh problem come solution so I am implementing this data structure problem in uh Java programming so uh first we have written the main uh function all you know all we all know that one then I have uh inial uh num as integer variable scanner s equal to new scanner of system.in this is for uh taking the input from the console as I am taking the integer number SC is the object for this scanner Clause so SC dot next in so I am taking the input from the console into the N variable so the number variable contains the input from the console that is in this way it is 13 it will contain number will contain the 13 then I am initializing mod variable and Su variable to zero value then I am writing the while loop with a condition like num not equal to zero so what I'm telling is run this Loop until the number is not equal to zero that means when the number became zero this while loop will be uh terminated okay uh so that is the while condition within the loop what I written mod equal to num mod 10 so uh this is a logic so mod means modulus modulus means uh whenever you uh fform a division the remainer will be called as modulus if in programming programming so modulus means after performing a division with some number it will give the remainder to you okay so num mod 10 num mod 10 means whenever I will U perform modus 10 uh with uh for a number it will gives me the last digit of the number that means uh our number is 13 right 13 mod 10 after performing this operation I will get the digit as three that means I got the last digit of the number right so once I got the three what I'm doing I adding this with sum at present sum is zero so zero plus mod value is this is mod value right + 3 so now sum equal to 3 at present then what I'm doing division whenever you divide a number by 10 uh it will took the last digit of the number and give the remaining digits means 13 by 10 means it is giving me one okay so what happened it took the L first digit of the number and gave the remaining value one so this is the value of n at present okay this is uh iteration uh one so after that again iteration two now again same now it will check again is number not equal to zero s 1 is not equal to zero num means one only right at present so one is not equal to Z So Satisfied now again mod equal to mod equal to uh 1 mod 10 what I told you it will give you the last digit of the number so it will give the one to me then sum equal to previously SU = to 3 right now 3 + 1 so sum = to 4 then num equal to num by 10 so obviously it will be zero 1 by 10 means it will come like 0 point something something right so the answer is zero so now the value of num equal to zero now again iteration three so in iteration three the number value is zero 0 is not equal to Z so the condition is false so it will come out of the while loop after coming out the out of the while loop the sum value it is printing to the console so what is the sum Val value now last value four so value equal to four or output is 4 so output is four uh 1 + 3 so output is for it is right right this output is for above number 13 for 1 + 3 it will be 4 okay so we got the output as four so this is the solution for this uh data such a problem we will meet in next video thank you

[Music] welome students welcome to Academy binary search tree binary search tree is a binary tree in which each node each node is systematically arranged so the left child has less value than its parent node so left child L right child parde par 18 so right child so systematic AR greater value right tree so binary search tree next next binary search operations insertion deletion search first insertion of a node in a binary tree read the compare this new node with each of thee if the value of the node which is to be inserted is greater we move on to the right sub Branch otherwise we move on to the left Branch 23 23er the third Point next fourth Point as soon as the appropriate position is found we attach this new as left or right appropriately next 22 2ed next delici of an yellow element from the binary tree Del first deltion of a leaf node Leaf node set the left or right pointer of the par so deltion of a leaf node soaf set the left or right pointer of the parent node as null next Del of a node having one child next having one next Del of a node having two childrens so examp so 698 number 68 smallest number six greatest number n middle number middle number number right side ofde having two children so concept next searching a node from your binary search the key node will be compared with each node starting from the root node if the value of the key node is greater than the current node then we search for it on a right sub Branch otherwise on the left sub Branch if we reach to the left node and still we do not get the value of the key node then we declare node is not present in thee search right meaning okay so the key node will be compared with each node key node now key will be compared with each not if we reach to the LIF note and still we do not get the value of the key note no is not present in the concept searching next next draw the binary search tree for the following inputs 14a 15a 4 9 7 18 3 5 16 4 20 17 9 14 5ep one okay next step two 15 insert compare next step three insert four the 14 next step four right next insert s 14 Next Step six insert 18 number next children 18 so okay next step seven insert three three insert 14 three number so left side number Next Step eight Next Step n insert 16 16 next insert four four insert short right most important step next insert 20 20 next insert 17 14 number 17 so right hand Next Step 13 insert okay next step 14 insert 14 2 so 14 14 number next next insert five 14 14 number problem over screens scre so first definition next insertion of a node in a binary tree okay next deltion of an element from the binary tree next searching a node from the binary search tree next problem binary search or problem next so problem end so binary search watch other episodes in the appropriate Playlist 4 silver Academy strength success Clarity w

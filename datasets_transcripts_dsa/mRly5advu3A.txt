let's go over lifo versus fifo so lipo stands for last and first out and represents the order in which items are inserted and deleted into the Stacked data structure so essentially what this means is that the last item to be inserted into the stack is going to be the first one to come out or to be deleted from the stack another common acronym that you'll also hear for Stacks is Philo which stands for first and last sound basically means the first item be insert into the stack is going to be the last one to come out of the stack moving forward let's talk about fifo so fifo stands for first in first out and represents the order in which items are insert and deleted to the Q data structure so essentially the first item being inserted to the Q is going to be the first when we come out of the queue another common acronym that you'll also hear for cues is a Lilo which stands for last in last out and basically means the last item be insert into the queues and be the last one to come out of the queue so my question for you is which one do you prefer do you prefer lipo versus fifo or Philo versus Lilo

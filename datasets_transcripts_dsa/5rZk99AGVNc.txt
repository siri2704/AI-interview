these are my three biggest tips for learning data structures and algorithms number one is know when to quit a lot of people say you should never give up and just keep trying that is a terrible strategy and you will waste so much time for me I generally spend about 20 minutes on it if I can't figure it out I get hints and if I still can't figure it out I read the solution I think where people get confused on this is Elite code CS them practice problems but really there's just a ton of theory on the page and you've got to learn all of it number two is you need to memorize a lot more than you think people seem to shun the idea of memorizing like you should just quote understand it unless you've memorized how to do a depth first search you're not going to be able to do it and especially not under pressure so just memorize it and I've solved the carefully picked questions on Alo map so many times that I just have all of it memorized at the same time and number three is there is definitely an order to this stuff check out algom app.io to learn it all for free in the correct order

If you are a beginner who has no experience in programming I suggest you to use C and C++ The reason is that C and C++ languages are closest to the hardware which means if you use these languages you can manage the memory as per your needs and you can interact closely with the hardware and you can take full control of it But all this is not free but comes with a learning curve that is if you are using pointers etc. and learning a coding language like C, C++ with manual memory management then it takes a little time for you to learn and you have to bear a little difficulty in learning it C or C++ is one of the fastest programming languages that's why many people like it a lot in terms of competitive programming but if you know an already programming language like Java, JavaScript or Python then you can use that programming language to learn data structure and algorithm here I want to give you a warning that if your programming language that you have learned is not very popular or is in a very beginner stage then it is possible that you may not get good resources to learn data structure and algorithm or good courses and this can hinder learning of your data structure and algorithm but if the first programming language you have learnt is Python Java or JavaScript then you are good to go and you can use this language to learn data structure and algorithm here i want to give a side note for python and java that in python and java memory management is automatic so that in the programs you make you may not be able to learn the actual use of data structure and algorithm but as long as you understand the concepts and you code the concepts in your language you are good to go but as long as you understand the concepts and make them in your language you are good to go in Python and Java, due to automatic memory management the memory you are not using is cleaned by garbage collector which is not good for learning data structure and algorithm but as long as you have good command over the language you are good to go and with this I want to come to the third point that whatever language you learn and use to learn data structures and algorithms you should have good command over it because as long as you understand that how variables work in the language you have learned how the data structures inbuilt work in it till then you will not face any problem in understanding data structural algorithms so I will give you an overview of all the languages one by one if you are using python then this is an easy to understand all rounder if you are using java then this is another all rounder with additional scope like android development web development and with the help of Java you can make GUIs. If I talk about JavaScript, then it is suited for web developers. And CC++ which is closest to the hardware, we have already talked about it. So if I talk about the final verdict, then I suggest you that if you are a beginner who has not learned any programming language and you want to learn competitive programming or a good logic building then you can start with C, C++ and learn data structures and algorithms from it and after that you can transition to any language once you have learned logic and all then you can apply the concepts you have learned in data structures and algorithms by transitioning to any language if you are using any of these languages then I have told you the reason if you already know any of these languages or know any other language then you can use data structure and algorithm with the help of that existing language but you have to keep in mind that the language you have learned corresponding to that you have some good resources to learn data structures and algorithms if those resources are not available then I will say back to the basics come to CC++ now if we talk about data structures and algorithms C sharp, PHP, Dart Objective C and many other programming languages with their help if you want to learn data structures and algorithms is it possible? yes it is possible but you have to keep an eye on do you have resources to learn from these languages do you have good guidance from these languages to learn data structures and algorithms if not then back to the basics if yes then you can proceed and always remember that you can transition from one language to another and data structures and algorithms are all about concepts till you understand concepts it is okay you will be able to apply logic building in your programs if I talk about resources then I have made a complete data structure and algorithm course I will give you the link in the description or in the pinned comment you can go and watch it I have used C and C++ to teach you data structure and algorithm the link to the course is in the description and not to mention that this is a free course I hope I have answered your questions Thank you so much guys for watching this video and I will see you next time. Bye!

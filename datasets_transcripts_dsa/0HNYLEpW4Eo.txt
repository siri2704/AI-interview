here are all the DSA topics that you should be focusing upon first and foremost arrays and strings make the foundation of the tall DSA building searching and sorting on arrays and playing with strings is something which is very very important then we move on to some basic data structures like link list stacks and cues after that we learn the most fundamental and by far the most important algorithm which is recursion and backtracking we move on to the tree data structure learning about binary trees and binary search trees post then we learn about an algorithm which is binary search it is the most beautiful when we understand it and it is the most scary when we don't then we move on to some other data structures like hashmaps Clarity cues and graphs side by side we should also focus upon G algorithms like two pointers and sliding window Technique we cannot complete DSA without dynamic programming so 1D DP 2D DP 3D DP should be something we should be focusing upon you cannot miss the TR data structure study all this and you will be good to go

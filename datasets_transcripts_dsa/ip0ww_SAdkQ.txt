to understand how to convert infix to postfix let's first look at what infix and postfix notations are infix notation is the common way of writing Expressions where operators are placed between operands such as a plus b postfix notation on the other hand is where operators follow their operands such as a B+ now let's consider how we can use a stack to convert infix to postfix a stack is a last and first out data structure which means the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed to convert an infix expression to postfix we can follow these steps scan the infix expression from left to right and for each token if it's an operand add it to the postfix expression if it's an operator pop operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression until we find an operator with lower precedence or the stack is empty then push the current operator onto the stack let's look at an example to make this clearer suppose we want to convert the infix expression A + B * C to postfix we start by scanning the expression from left to right when we encounter a we add it to the postfix expression when we encounter plus we push it onto the stack when we encounter B we add it to the postfix expression when we encounter times we pop the plus from the stack and add it to the postfix expression then push times onto the stack finally when we encounter C we add it to the postfix expression and when we're done scanning the expression we pop the times from the stack and add it to the postfix expression so the infix expression a plus b * C becomes AB C * Plus in postfix this process can be applied to any infix expression to convert it to postfix remember the key is to use the stack to keep track of operators and their precedence and to add operands directly to the postfix expression with practice converting infix to postfix using a stack becomes straightforward now that you've seen how to convert infix to postfix using a stack try converting some Expressions on your own to get a feel for the process and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification on this topic

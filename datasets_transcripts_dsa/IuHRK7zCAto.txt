so in the last session we started data structures and algorithms with python a new batch online batch the duration of this batch is 2 months fees is 2,500 the timings is nothing but 9:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m. to 10 or 1015 like that will be there and in the first session I explained the syllabus what we are going to discuss and even yesterday we started one application like how to check whether the given string is a hexadecimal string or not yesterday only few people came that's why I have taken only one application now the next application which I'm going to discuss is second application sir this one I'm going to explain today what is this application are you seeing sir if we have any string like suppose I have a string called a only one character is there in that string how many substrings you can able to frame only one substring you can frame if you take a string with two characters how many substrings you can frame so sorry here not this one only so two empty string and then a sir here how many substrings you can frame first one is empty then a then B then AB also if you have three then like this sir if you have a string with n characters how many substrings you can frame can I take 2 power n correct in this case apply the formula sir how many characters are there sir one 2 power 1 value is what two sir two substrings two subsets if you take two square four two characters are there means four possible combinations sir 2 Cube means what eight eight possible combinations if you have a string with four characters how many we can frame how many combinations you will get what is a 2 power 4 value 16 16 16 combinations you are going to get so this is nothing but one small application of course data structure related application we have to see how to implement this application now sir if you are clear with the concept I will explain first logic to implement this later I will write the code also sir everyone feeling comfortable up to this yes sir can I start implementing this right sir it is a very lamian terminology everyone can understand this concept very clearly listen how we are going to get sir first first assume I have a string called ABC I'm going to explain this concept for ABC third string third third sorry a string with length how many characters three characters for that I'm demonstrating assume initially the string which you have given is nothing but ABC Now what is my task is there are two operat which I'm going to take I will pass this string as a input and also result string I'm going to pass my result string is always empty and starting location what is a starting location here zero okay I'm going to create a method which is going to take three parameters what is the first parameter the given string ABC what is the second parameter empty string what is a third parameter zero zero which is nothing but starting index are you clear with this terminology as of now please confirm yes sir sir what's the parameter parameter is nothing but arguments arguments whenever you are calling a function see we will pass some values right mhm that is called as parameter okay okay now thank so what is my requirement is Sir in index zero which character is there can you please confirm a yeah so I will take two combinations here what is the first combination is including the character present at zero e location which is nothing but a excluding the character present at zero e location is nothing but a so my first thing is I will take this character and I will add into the answer sir if you take the character original string will become as it is and I am adding a to the Target so that what will be the target a and index is going to be incremented sir what about second case I'm not going to add so what will be the result ABC comma empty string only but index we are going to add sir everyone comfortable how I have taken these two phases what is a first phase that I have taken sir just I included the character called a and second case is nothing but what I excluded the character if you include the character I'm going to add the character present at zero location into the answer if you exclude we are not adding the character so zero the character task is completed we have to repeat this for the character which is located at first location and the character located at second location that we will do but up to this phase any doubts no yes any any queries no sir first location means ABC a comma 1 okay we have taken first character including a and excluding a means ABC nothing and the uh location [Music] yes sir clear everyone yes sir whatever scenario we have taken same thing we will apply for this one also same thing we will apply for this one but here the location is going to change in this case what will happen the character which is present at first location what is that character B we are going to take the character present at this location and we will add to the answer so by including and here excluding if you include what will happen I'm going to get ABC so comma AB comma 2 sir here what will happen ABC comma sir a comma 2 like this we are going to get and here A C sir which location we are adding B and then two and here what will happen sir ABC then uh nothing will be there and then two sir are you clear with this in this we focused on which location first location got it everyone any queries sir this first parameter sir this one ABC comma a comma 1 sir yes sir can you go in deep that ABC ab what deep sir ABC comma AB comma to how how sir you understood this first one right yeah then what is this one same right okay sir please don't ask in detail questions sir please focus on the content again I can't go for python right okay okay okay sir sir clear everyone yes sir then in this level uh tell me what is the second location character C again for this two two combinations you will get in the first case tell me what will be the result ABC comma the character present at the second location is C we have to add that character to AB what will happen it will become ABC and then index + 1 will become three what is the second location sir ABC we are not adding the character C to this so that it will become ab and then length is nothing but three are you clear yes sir and here also same right tell me sir what will be the result answer H please we have to take the character present at the second location we need to add to the result sir the character present at second location is a c we have to add to the a what will be the result guys please open your mouth AB BC a Ab BC a sir we have to remove the character from here we need to add to a already a is there we have to add C what will be the result AC and index is incremented by one unit so next one a b c we are not adding C so result will become a only and here it is three sir guys clear please confirm are you able to follow please respond we are dealing with only two parameters clear ah yes sir clear then here tell me what are the two combinations you will get first one a BC what will be the answer take the character present at the second location and we have to add it to the B what will be the result CB are you following or not why you are telling always wrong answers so already B is there for B we have to add C it will become BC and index + 1 3 what will be next one sir a b c we are not adding C it will become only B and then two clear everyone yes sir what about these two sir here it is ABC we have to add C to the result it will become C and then three and in this case AB C we are not adding anything empty string and then three once if the length and index are same we will stop uh please cross check what is answer here ABC what is answer here AB sir a a b c b c Mt correct so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 because three characters are there eight combinations if you have four characters again we have to expand these two again to two how many levels you will get 1 2 3 4 five six 7even eight levels here so there you are going to get 16 levels see how much practice you need to do to understand the concept but program is very simple the internal thing if you understand writing the code is very simple guys everyone please confirm you understood this diagram right how internally it is happening yes sir any questions on this please if you are clear then I will write the code don't worry again I'm going to explain this concept in our recursion chapter can I go for implementation yes sir now I want to take a Python program for this just simply I'm going to take uh test. py program is there now listen see I'm going to take s is equal to input input of so enter any string I'm going to ask the user to enter some string then I'm going to call a function like a subsets where I will pass the string and also answer and also zero location that's all initially answer is empty and starting location is zero and I'm giving a string which function we have to implement now subsets function we have to implement which is going to take a string and also answer and then index value sir is the Prototype is it clear for everyone please confirm yes sir compulsory you should have a knowledge on functions otherwise you can't understand that's why I told very clearly sir compulsory compulsory you should have python knowledge otherwise it is very difficult to understand the concepts sir clear everyone can I go for implementation of subsets function yes sir continue yeah there are two steps are there recursion steps subsets we are calling by taking the yes and answer plus can I take yes of index in the that index which value is there that value I'm going to get from the string and I will add to the answer and index + one is the formula is correct correct because you know in Python we can use plus operator for concatenating of strings also correct correctly can I do like this uh yes sir second one is what formula is same but we should not add correct that's all sir code is that's all so everyone understood whatever answer is there for that I'm adding the character from this string at index position after that we are going to increment index by one unit second one we are not adding this one sir everyone is this two method calls second line and third line are clear got it everyone please confirm one second H any question so please explain two and three line again see uh if you see the diagram just have a look once in this diagram what we are doing sir I'm highlighting just observe take this one or take this one sir this is the original string yes correct this is my answer a ands and this is my index correct yes sir correct what I'm doing in the second location which character is there capture that and add it to the answer right right so from yes how to get the character presented index yes of index correct yes so correct how to add to the answer answer plus yes of index clear this line okay and in this case in this case we are not adding so answer will become answer s got it got it sir got it and from here what will happen after adding index we are incrementing in both cases that's all sir understood sir everyone please confirm clear clear sir and tell me when we have to stop this process Anna whenever at the last the length of the given string and index value both are same we have to stop correct yes sir tell me how to write the condition if the value of the length of the string is equal to index we have to print the answer and I will terminate is it correct code yes sir correct that's all now I will execute this program ppace test. p you can see enter any string I will give ABC sir is all combinations are printing or not ABC AB AC sir but null is not there actually null means empty right it won't print if you want you can check so if your answer dot or length of the answer is equal to zero means empty string is there in such a cases just for our convenient purpose we can print null otherwise print the answer then stop the control now you can see if I'm giving a so two two characters you are going to get if you are giving AB four combinations if you are giving ABC eight combinations sir a b c d you can see sir if I'm giving my name like prakash you can see how many combinations it is going to print so everyone understood how internally this is small application like how to calculate subsets are going to work like it is one of the application of recursion friends everyone clear up to this yes so clear any questions please confirm guys clear are everyone yes sir that's all sir this is about today's session uh tomorrow there is no classes sir next class is going to be held on uh Monday Monday okay the people who are interested you can start registering Monday also maximum I will try to take demo session okay okay sir any questions no sir can we pay the fee tomorrow or today uh yes okay and for that ADC also can you be the yeah please pay for ADC but this one please wait till Monday okay okay okay okay you can start paying the fee sir no issues because even if minimum 10 members are coming we will start a batch okay okay sir for this Monday should be the last M yes Monday Monday is the last demo session okay thank you yeah any questions right sir thank you

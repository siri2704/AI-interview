let's get into the video and this is me nandy your best friend so now in the fourth stage of the circuit board so in the fourth stage see stage one stage two stage three and stage four even the first stage on the uploader basic stage so in the basic stage or a programming language and the programming language level the conditional statements and looping statements simply work out they're moon stage recording so you know uh so in the stage 11 the intermediate to one night so in the intermediate one stage now so in this stage the link list stacks queue and arriva it means that you are you are you are using your own logic to up on november now start with competitive programming so in the competitive programming and now in abdi now see you have some websites called code chef code force website websites learn the participation and start manila next one they move on to linked list so move on to linked list uh type different types of linked list so in the different first one the types of linked lists basically are going to move to the next stage the final stage that is the pro stage so in the pro stage from the faster absorbing absorbing already problems these are all the stages involved to master a programming i mean master data structures and algorithms hope so now let's have been silly i'll come and meet you in the next video and until then it's my from me uh this will definitely be useful for all other coding friends as well

hey everyone welcome back to another video and i'm super excited to announce that your search for the best data structures and algorithms plus interview preparation course ends now i know it may seem like a little repetitive like oh uh everyone says that right but in this video i'm gonna tell you how you know this is the only course you need and how you can clear any fang interview when we talk about coding rounds online coding rounds even like competitive competitions uh interview rounds right phone screens and like your coding rounds and technical assessments you can clear every single thing using this course and the special thing about this course the beauty of this course is that it's i want to sound humble but i can't because it is pure legendary my channel got 1 lakh 100 000 subscribers with just this course i only uploaded like 40 videos or something and i got 0 to 1 lakh subscribers with 1 million plus views on the playlist of my course and people are loving it people are saying it's the best recursion playlist that we have single-handedly watched in their entire life on youtube best object oriented programming playlist best everything this is free it's on my channel you can definitely check it out and decide for yourself if you don't want to trust me so let me tell you a little bit more about the course you can go to communityclassroom.org you can go to explore our courses section and there you will find all the upcoming courses and ongoing courses here you can go to the courses section you can check out the testimonials faq and how to join so here you can see the courses uh you can check out data structures and algorithms it will leave you over here so as you can see this course is designed to prepare you from your coding interview for your coding interviews and develop a strong foundation in datasets algorithms along with problem solving coding interviews are broken of these big tech companies amazon and google and facebook and microsoft and you know all these other big tech companies the data algorithms dsa questions they ask they ask it from like the testing you assessing you on your problem solving skills on various data structures various algorithms or whatever so the thing is that i was able to clear all my google rounds i aced all my google rounds i actually did a podcast with my own google recruiter who gave me like a shout out in that and my skill set so i have like received tons and tons of offers and the thing is that i want to help people like achieve the same things like i did right so a little bit more about this course you can check out uh you know the code is going to be given to us so the code sample that i'll be writing will be given to you assignments will be given to you shout outs you can check out what this course has helped like you can see almost 3000 retweets right so you can see all these people are learning a lot from me my courses this is just a shout out of the data structures algorithms course you can check out almost 3 000 tweets right and this is only like three months of progress so this is pure legendary course and you can check out you know what i have to offer over here and this is the entire playlist if you go over here this is containing all the videos i am not here to make 15 minute tutorials or whatever this binary search video as you can see uh binary search algorithm interview questions which is a four hour long video when i say that you will be able to clear any fang interview i mean it and when i say that i'm covering entire thing in detail not leaving anything i mean it so question is kunal what makes this course special why should we only consider this course and why are you saying this is the best course that you can watch on youtube for free right now this is a reason number one once you start with this course you will see the outcome like this you will be able to solve lead code easy to hard problems like this when you approach a problem you yourself in your mind will think oh i actually did nothing i only applied kunal's tips and tricks that's what coding interview problems are all about problem solving skills trying to assess when when a question is given to you in google or facebook interviews or whatever you have to think about the brute force approach then you have to think about the time complexity space complexity and they are actually assessing you if you know what type of data is going to be used for which type of algorithm which type of data structure so when a problem is given to you instantly after watching this course instantly it will click in your mind oh this is like a one to n range canal mentioned that whenever you're giving one to n range apply cyclic sort oh these are n sorted lists could all mentioned use the heap method or whatever or linked list or whatever it will actually click in your mind like this so instead of solving questions blindly i'm actually picking out the internal details of what sorts of questions are asked in fang companies from these data structures and algorithms that is why i got one lakh subscribers in three months that is why this is the best course on youtube that you can do right now about my credibility folks even ask that so i was able to clear like all my you know interview rounds just following this approach i have been teaching a net tech startup some of the bigger biggest tech startups in india since my freshman year i have over three four years of experience in teaching my skill set and my way of teaching you can find yourself on this in this playlist you can check it out yourself i don't have to say that to you because you are the judge for that so you can check it out the time complexity lecture people loved it solve any patent questions with this trick already has over 3 lakh views 300 000 views so my only motive with this is that all these paid courses are amazing right that is the reason i have this course because i want this to be accessible for free to everyone okay this is the only data algorithms course you need anyone can explain to you data structures anyone can explain to your algorithms i have searched a lot on youtube and i have not found a single person who has completed entire like data source algorithms with like uh the approach that i am following because they are just solving problems i am not solving problems i'm solving problems and i'm telling you how to approach a problem please watch this boot camp it will change your life right syllabus we start from the very basics if you don't even know what programming is i start over there right introduction programming flow of program then we start with an introduction to java folks even often ask you know should we do data structure algorithms in java or c plus plus quite frankly two points one uh no one cares you can do it in c plus plus java python javascript whatever you want in coding interviews your problem solving skills matter most language does not matter that much right point number two i would recommend java why java is being used by you know so many companies right and uh you can do computer plumbing in java as well on google on youtube just go search for google code jam winners or just write facebook hacker cup winners there have been live streams of that where people are using java in these global computer programming competitions so it's not like you're going to miss out on compare prompting if you do java java is amazing for computer programming okay and one more thing when we talk about open source contributions if you do open sourcing c plus or c for students in my experience i've seen getting into open source projects of cnc plus plus is very difficult as compared to java or something so i started with digital algorithms with java in my first semester and in my first year i was a google summer of course student with red hat where i worked on cuban it is java client i only knew java that's how how much helpful java was for me in my career students often ask me in their college canal can you suggest me c plus plus resources once they have been graduated and working then they ask me kunal can you suggest me spring boot and java resources so you can do it in anything i'm not saying there's algorithms easy process is not a good thing i'm saying no one really cares plus java will give you a better edge so having said that you can do it in cps plus as well because my course is actually more on the you know understanding part as well you can follow my course in python my c plus or java or whatever you want okay let me talk about functions and methods uh data structures like arrays and error list and one important thing i want to mention over here is that all the topics contain problems from lead code easy to hard explain in an easy to understand manner complete custom implementation of all data structures algorithms is also covered this is something you cannot find on youtube easily now after my course has been launched many other folks like have started making it but the quality and the content and the quantity is not even close not even close people are making recursion videos of just like you know in one single short recursion videos that's not how recursion is supposed to be recursion i have made like 20 hours of videos explaining every single topic so what makes this course also special is custom implementation plus interview problems so recursion google problems cycle sort of uh interview problems of google and microsoft and whatever binary search bitwise operators objectory programming link list you can see google facebook amazon apple questions such things i'm covering for every single for every single data structure and even custom implementation like writing the datasheet from scratch cool then searching and sorting mathematics as well bitwise operators data types prime factors everything recursion this is the golden playlist that i have created on youtube i am pretty confident you will not find this anywhere this level of quality and this level of how to master recursion you will pre period you will not find it backtracking as well space and time complexity i have aced it objectively farming people have given me shout outs that they have gotten they have cleared their interview rounds of adobe amazon uh various startups and all these other big tech companies just while watching my my youtube course right just with object improving again you can go over there over here you can go at the shout out section you can check it out right and then uh link list which is one of the most important data structures uh stacks and cues trees heaps hash maps graph theory dynamic programming and some additional topics as well like sliding window to pointer greedy algorithms and more cool so you can clear any fang interview by in just 60 days of preparation you can take 90 days if you want three months and keep practicing over and over at the end of this bootcamp i'll also mention like what next what after completing the boot camp right again no prerequisites you don't have to know anything nothing is required 100 free check it out over here cool it will change your life just watch it once and you will realize yourself that no other course or content creator like the way they explain registers can even come close to the quality right i'm only telling you this for your benefit because a lot of people have uh been you know like they get fired and then they make overhyped resources or whatever and it's just wasting your time this is not going to waste your time this is the only you can even screen share record this or whatever you want to do this is the only data section algorithms course on youtube that lives up to the hype mark my words all right um so doubt support but we have structured learning notes are given assignments are given you can join our live discord server they have you have created discussions discussion channels you can check out over there and guidance obviously and projects right so this is something that is true for all our courses and it's

have been getting calls like hey that dude canal that this course is really legendary okay i would like to end this with this note clearing fan interviews is a piece of cake because coding interviews are broken and the the tips and tricks to clear coding interviews i mentioned in this playlist you will not find this anywhere on youtube last thing is you don't have to trust me at all every single thing i have mentioned in this video ignore ignore it watch these videos yourself that's it watch still like areas and arraylist and like till binary search you watch binary search till binary search only if you don't like it unsubscribe or whatever buy whatever you want watch whatever you want it does not matter it will literally change your career life because i know database algorithms is extremely important and you will be able to clear any fang interview after watching this course just watch till the main data structures like till binary search interview problems it's a four hour long video and i've put a lot of efforts in every single perfecting every single video all these important links that i have shared you can find those in the in the description like the link in the

so good evening in the yesterday's videos we started a new batch on data structures and algorithms with Java okay so DSA with Java so this is nothing but Ninth Batch and these are the previous class recorded recording videos okay so this is nothing but a third demo so already we completed two demos that link I'm going to share in the chat window the people who are attending sir this is my first session like if anyone is there you can refer that and in the last classes I explained about our course what we are going to cover and what is the syllabus what benefits we are going to get with the help of our course also I demonstrated very clearly with the help of examples and even sir so we have seen how to print a simple hello world message on the screen and even we discussed how we can able to develop even number or odd number application also I explained very clearly in the last sessions next and after that sir I included how you can able to create object oriented programming okay like if you are cre creting any data member inside a class how we can able to add that data member to the class okay how you can able to set the data and even how we can able to get the data also we covered very clearly in the last sessions okay next after that so for the replacement of setar methods we used this Constructor also okay means what in the place of setar method if we want we can go for Constructor also so if you take a Constructor what will happen that part also we have seen very clearly in the last videos next and after that if a data member is two data members are there how we can able to Define Constructor also we have seen very clearly in the last videos then I explained y Queen's problem what is mean by y Queen's problem that is nothing but a chessboard uh problem it is nothing but something like a chessboard n by chessboard will be there and our task is we have to place the queen inside the chess board so that we have some rules out there what is the first rule only one Queen is allowed for a row okay inside row we can take only one Queen like that how many rows will be there n rows will be there so your task is you have to fill all these row with Queens okay such that no two queens should collide with each other like that we have to implement and even we have seen the movement of the queen so a queen can move in how many directions Sir a queen can move in the left Direction in the right direction in the up Direction in the down Direction all four diagonal positions also it can able to move and even we have seen how we can able to implement things by using this recursion and back tracking I think I covered only that demonstration purpose we didn't implemented any program for that so soon we are going to discuss about that okay so next and after that so as a part of continuation for this already that objectoriented programming we included right sir I want to take so one class to demonstrate this object oriented programming continuation of this something like example number four I'm going to take of course last example so what is that example here is I'm going to take intellig idea for continuing this program sir here I want to create one new Java class the name of the Java class is nothing but point point like this I'm going to take so what is mean by this point generally it is a mathematical component every point will have two values one is nothing but x coordinate value and then another one is nothing but what y coordinate so I can say these two are nothing but data members for this product class okay these two are nothing but what sorry point class data members of the point class now my requirement is I want to initialize these two values how you can initialize these two values sir I'm going to create one point class which is going to take integer x coordinate and integer y coordinate I'm going to take two coordinates okay so current do X will become X and current y will become I'm taking y like this I'm going to initialize x value as well as y value then sir after this I'm going to use one gar function which is going to return the value of x and I'm going to take one more gar function which is nothing but get y so which is going to return the value of y like this I implemented a program so now generally how to run this program we need to create main class right in the main class I'm going to Define so Point P1 is equal to so new point something like this I'm giving so x coordinate is a 10 y coordinate is a 20 and I want to create another Point P2 so where x coordinate is nothing but 10 y coordinate is nothing but 30 like that I have so how to print first point values compulsory we have to take system. out. print p1. getx okay followed by comma so plus p1. get Y which is going to return x coordinate and then y coordinate so related to the first point if you want for second Point P2 do get X and P2 get y i if you run this program what will happen it is going to return so two pointer variables I mean two points one is nothing but 10 comma 20 and another Point values are nothing but 10 comma 30 like that we have so okay well and good there is no problem with this point class but my requirement is what will happen if we are printing that point object directly I don't want to print okay I don't want to print like individual members directly can't I print this point values like here I want to print P1 and here I want to print P2 sir when you are printing the object directly please make sure that you won't get any content it will always written the address where that point1 class object is available so where that point two class point class P2 object is available it will return addresses of those objects let me run the program and check what will happen sir are you seeing point at the 1B 6D 3586 it is something like address point at the 4546 17c something like it is the address like that it is going to return address of that Point variable like this we have sir when you are printing the object directly this is the situation happens sir okay fine I don't want this whenever you are printing sir I need to get that content I don't want that one sir what we have to do I think you have already knowledge on this we have to go for which method sir two string method we have to implement which method we have to implement two string so in which class we have to implement which class object we are trying to print sir point class right that's why in the point class that two string method we have to implement so how to do that public okay so string public string two string method we have to take and it is going to written in the form of a string sir better I will represent the data in the form of point where the first parameter is Sir can I ask get X get X which is going to return X pointer plus comma okay so I'm going to call get Y which is going to return by Point like that it is going to take sir that's all let me cross check sir now when you are printing P1 P2 instead of printing the memory location sir is it printing that point content or not yes so this this is the way how we can able to override which method two string method so the total story whatever I explained till now is the need of this two string method because in the data structures whenever we are writing the code we will always Implement two string method why because if you take a stack can I print the elements present in the stack highly impossible because stack is used for processing purpose not for storing so if you want to print to check whether it is working properly or not so we have to go with two string even if you take tree data structure linked list data structure in these cases we are always override which method or two string method so that if you print link list object it is going to print the total content like that we have sir I think the reason why I explained this one and how to implement that two string method this concept is very clear for you I think so sir please confirm everyone is it clear up to this whatever I covered please confirm friends sir I need response from everyone please confirm clear up to this whatever I covered guys please respond are why no response from other students sir are you understanding the concept right good good yes Akash P Dil Babu nazmal prano Sachin saam please respond then what is a need to attend the classes sir my this is my first class sir okay right at least you should respond right at least yeah right sir now um yes of course without without going for the next thing sir I'm I'm trying to demonstrate since these are the demo classes okay yeah so today I'm going to talk about linked list linked list concept I want to take just demo purpose sir I'm not starting linked list data structure as of now just demo purpose I'm taking so what is mean by linked list so in Java the first first concept what we have is variable variable which can able to hold only a single value at a time how many values it can able to accommodate only one value it can able to accommodate so there are some problems because uh we can't hold multiple items at a time okay and even only one value if you store another value the first value is going to be gone like that we have some limitations to overcome this we are going for arrays where we can collect huge number of values okay but there is again problem with arrays what is that problem is it is always fixed in size fixed in size means what sir I have a classroom capacity as a 60 students so now if you implement by using arrays you can able to take only 60 MERS you can't to take even 61 also because in Java aray size is always fixed sir can I able to increase this yes for that we have collections are there one of the collection what we have is link list something like it is a growable growable means what keep on you can add you can remove any operation you can do sir what is the definition of Link list I can say it is nothing but a collection of nodes collection of nodes sir there are two types of nodes there are two types of one is nothing but single node and second one is nothing but a double so what is mean by single node anyway I'm going to explain with the help of diagram okay so later while discussing about linked list I will demonstrate so this is called as single node sir like this it will be there this is called as what single node and double node means what sir it is something like single node only but three Fields will be there like this this is called as what double node like this we have so single node means this field is called as what data field this field is called as what data field and this field is called as next field which is pointing to the next memory location so double node means three Fields will be there this field is called as field okay and this field is called as next field which is point Sorry previous field which is pointing to the previous node and this field is called as next field which is pointing to the next node like that we okay so single notes will be there double notes will be there like this so collection of these single nodes are called as single link list so in short from so collection of these double notes are called as double link list D sometimes you will connect these single nodes in a circular fashion then it is called as circular single link list so which is called as Cs and even these double nodes sometimes you can collect by using circular fashion double circular Double L like this sir in our linked list we are going to cover these four programs one specific program for single link list for specific program for double link list like but anyway in today's demo session I want to demonstrate some small applications on single link list so maybe I want to display the elements present in the single link list how we can do sir I want to insert one element into the uh link list how you can able to insert so just how I am explaining this link list program how the flow of execution is going to be just to understand that I'm going to demonstrate okay sir everyone please confirm is the concept is clear theory part related to this link list please confirm yes sir right sir I'm taking a program okay so what is my sir I request everyone to please respond because with this much effort if trainer is telling if there is no response from your side it is not good sir I request everyone to please respond there should be a proper communication right right right so now I'm going to take one one simple algorithm which is nothing but what is that algorithm is Sir insert insert at first location sir I want to insert one linked list one node into the first location how we can able to do what is a code snippet for that so it contains totally two instructions okay what is the first instruction is uh of course we will write later but just try to understand node new node is equal to I'm creating a new node with some data okay with some data like that I'm going to create so with the help of this line what we are going to get we are going to create a new and and there are two cases are there what is the first case is is head is equal to null so what is the second case is if head is not equal to n when head will become null sir if there is no linked list sir do I have any link list as of no then in such cases what will happen very simple the node which you are creating it will become head node and it will become tail node Okay so then it is nothing but your new node Y and return return the that's all only one step sir assume I'm going to create a link list first I will I will draw the structure of the no sir consider this is nothing but node structure that I have sir initially do I have any single link list no right then what will happen is so I'm going to create a new node this is nothing but the new node what we we have and since head is equal to null initially the node which you created this one so this one will become which node head node okay because there is no head node the newly created node by yourself is nothing but what head node what we have okay so the newly created node will become what head node this is nothing but consider as a head node so which is the head node this one is nothing but head node like this we have so now I want to create one more function sir consider the data in this node is nothing but something like 10 I want to create one more sir can I say we are performing insert at first location right so definitely the node which you are going to create it will be added at which location first location now we have to connect these two sir is head equal to n no because head is already pointing to some no in such cases what we have to do we need to write code for this else part sir how we are going to write code sir if head node is already there very simple that newly created node next field is there right it is pointing to the head and that head will will become newly created no these are the two steps that you have to take so what is the first step here so newly created node can I say is it newly created node or not yes this newly created node next field will become head sir is it next field or not yes this will become what head like this from now onwards sir which is head not this one this one will become head now like that we have sir I can say this data is nothing but F that's all sir previously in a link list how many notes are there only one note which is nothing but 10 now how many notes are there two notes so where we inserted that file can I say is it insert at first or not yes so now I want to add one more sir can I copy paste this one yes sir where it is added here it is added what is the content sir four now this is the new node or not yes now we are going to attach this node as what head node and there will be a connection between like this so like this in this stale we are going to attach the nodes continuously so this operation is called as what insert at first location don't worry when we are discussing about the total link list program I will demonstrate this but as of now see at top level and how many instructions are there how the instructions are working you need to focus so are you clear with this inserted first location algorithm please confirm please confirm sir this is the skeleton the total code we will write later so everyone please confirm clear friends yes clear sir right so now another operation I want to demonstrate yes high level idea is clear very good so now my next algorithm of course it is also related to the link list only listen sir already I have a linked list is there okay already I have one linked list is there in the system like like this I have some group of notes are there okay maybe some three to four notes are there like this let us take five notes so what is my requirement is there is a connection between the nodes like this and Sir last node there is no ending node for this that's why I'm taking this one as a null sir consider the data is nothing but 11 so 22 so 33 44 55 something like that and I told so this entire linked list how you can monitor there will be one special pointer will be there so I'm considering that pointer as what head mod which is always pointing at the first mode now I want to implement the code for which operation display operation can you please display the elements present in this link list sir first I will explain the logic please listen carefully how it is going to work sir initially I'm taking one special pointer called temp okay I will make temporary node to this first node sir can I print the data what is the data that we have level sir after that take your temp to point to the next one sir print the data and again make temp to point to the next node sir print the data again make your temporary node to point to the next node sir print the data and Sir make your temporary node to point to the next Noe so like that how many times you have to repeat until until your temp will become null last what will happen your temp will become which one sir null rate sir in such cases we are going to stop so whatever algorithm I told now I'm going to write in the form of code what is that code very simple sir I'm going to take node temporary node is equal to initially it is pointing to head suppose if the temporary node is equal to n null then what is the meaning can I say linked list is empty empty so otherwise what we have to do sir I'm going to take so until the value of temp is not equal to null so we have to perform display operation can you please print okay sir while temp is not equal to null can you please print that temp do data so after that what we have to do your temp will become temp do next like this process keep on repeating sir so at last what we are going to get all the elements present in the linked list are going to be display so it is something like we have a chain of list is there so we are making the pointer to point to the first node okay so we will print the data and we will ask the next node like that it is a chaining process it is going to filter I mean it is going to retrive all the noes one by one so when it is going to be stopped when it reaches to the ending it will stop so I think everyone understood how it is going to work internally sir is the display operation is it clear for you people please confirm clear right I request everyone to please confirm clear up to this sir actually please discuss T do next again please uh sir temp. next means sir temp is nothing but this this particular node right so every node is having two Fields one field is a data field another field is nothing but next next means it is connected to the next node actually if you write the code for this node class then you can understand that so it is something like a class node sir where whenever you are creating you will have two Fields will be there one is nothing but a data field another field is nothing but next field so whatever data that you are giving you will assign so do you know next field is nothing but it is a pointer which is pointing to the another note initially it will be always n sir a link is pointing to the another note something like in the structures self- referencing structures will be there right in that style it will be okay but don't worry just see at the top level so anyway we will discuss about this with respect to the program got it yes sir sir please confirm everyone are you clear with this terminology whatever I told right so with this I'm going to stop today's demo so tomorrow I'm going to start our first chapter of course just I told already we are going to refresh the knowledge of java whatever we have so as a part of continuation for that so introduction part all these things I will explain later so I'm going to start sample algorithms and implementations tomorrow I'm going to start our so second chapter or third chapter like that which is nothing but sample algorithms okay so sample algorithms and implementations sir in this chapter we have around okay in this chapter we have around 20 programs of there okay 20 programs are there tomorrow I will give that list of 20 programs and tomorrow day after tomorrow we are going to finish this particular 20 programs sir in this 20 programs you are going to cover all the topics it is something like refreshing our Java knowledge and what are the various possible ways are there to solve the problems also you will get it okay and parallely so I'm going to share the running notes videos everything already the students who are willing to continue you can start making the payments and get registered for this course those who are willing to continue okay and I already told on weekends we are going to spend more time okay so uh yeah syllabus I will share in the chart window it is there even in the website also you can cross check okay now if you are having any queries you can ask me otherwise you can leave the session so tomorrow we have our regular class so tomorrow onward I will start the syllabus I'm not going to wait for anything okay right any doubts any doubts FS please confirm hello sir yes sir sir tomorrow also we have demo or or real classes demo demo demo only demo only tomorrow after tomorrow mostly tomorrow I will wind up Sir from Friday we will have regular classes yes yes you can ask after after completing this course can we expect any can we code any program sir like yes happily sir happily wherever data structures concept will come into the picture there happily you can able to write code that knowledge you can able to get from this but parall practice from your side is also highly okay sir thank you sir right right guys thank you see you tomorrow good night

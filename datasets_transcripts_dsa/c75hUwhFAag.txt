the best way to learn about data structures and algorithms is in my opinion getting practice with it and seeing how they work with data for example take a random data set CC file whatever and load that data into your python script and then do some processing and then see what happens if you use different data structures and see what happens in terms of performance in terms of capabilities I think that's going to help you learn a lot about how they work and python has like most of the core data structures that you're going to be doing that in Python is really a great way to learn about that and then of course if you want to go deeper and you would like to have more of the let's say theoretical background there are certainly books and courses you can read about that

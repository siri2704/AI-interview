let's understand what is recursion recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of problem until it reaches a base condition key elements of recursion recursion has two critical Parts the base case which acts as the stopping condition and the recursive case where the function calls itself to reduce the problem into smaller chunks here's a simple example of recursion counting down from a given number n the function keep calling itself reducing n by 1 each time when n reaches zero it stops and prints T another classic example is calculating the factorial of a number the factorial of n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n the base case is when n = 1 and the recursive case multiplies n with the factorial of nus 1

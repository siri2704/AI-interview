[Music] hello and welcome to my channel study with prto today I will discuss week six quid of the course programming data structures and algorithms using python Please Subscribe my channel and press the Bell icon I will upload all the assignment answers of this course in this Channel and share the video with your friends now the first question is on your screen suppose u and v both rote sets in Python under what condition can we guarantee that U minus in uus V equal to V so the answer will be the set V should be a subset of the set u option C now this is the second question suppose u and v denote sets in Python under what condition this is true that means this double equal to this now the answer will be the states u and v should be disjoined now coming to question number three which of the following does not corresponds to a Max Hep on the list of values now this list is given now what is Max Hep this type of Hep where the parent node is greater than the child node is the Maxi that means uh in this option we have to find out which he does not follow this rule that means the child notes uh element not smaller than the parent node elements okay uh now uh 97 55 83 23 45 72 31 19 31 uh 28 if we put uh this uh list in the Heap structure then if 31 was there in the place of 29 then this was correct but but in this case this does not correspond to a Max option b now if we uh do same for the other three option then we will find that it follows the maximum Hep condition the parent node is larger than the child node okay so this is uh question number three now coming to question number four consider the max he uh the list is given suppose we apply the operation delete Max twice to this Max he the resulting Max Hep is now if we apply the operation delete Max to a particular Hep then what happens we can see uh this is a hep we apply the delete Max operation to this Max Hep why I am saying that this is a maxi because we can see that all the values of the parent node is larger than the child node that mean 33 is larger than 247 24 is larger than 125 10 and 12 is smaller than 12 so this is a Max now if we apply the operation delete Max first what will happen removing the maximum value creates a hole at the root at first we have to remove this root node that means the maximum value of this hip so 33 we have to remove now if we remove this 33 then it will create a hole in the place of 33 like this now the second point is reducing one value requires deleting the last no that that means in this hip what is the last node 11 is the last node we have to remove this last node that is 11 and we have to move this 11 in the hole and it will move to the root node now what we have to do we have to restore the heat property from root downwards so swap with largest child that means we have to swap the position of this 241 so 11 will come to this place and 24 will go to this place so we have to Interchange the position of 12 and 11 so in this way we have to proceed so here 24 came in this place and 11 came in this place so uh after 12 came to the place of 11 and 11 came to the place of 12 so in this way we have to proceed and again this is a Max SE then again we apply delete Max operation then what will happen at first 24 will remove that means it create a hole in the place of 24 like this next the what is the last note 10 is the last note so 10 will be removed and it will come to this place so like this 10 will come to the place of the root node now again we have to follow the rule that means there is 11 there is 10 so these two elements will interchange its position so like this 11 will come to this place and 10 will come to this place so in this way we have to uh proceed in this question after that what is the resulting Maxim so this will be the answer 74 37 55 31 19 42 29 18 so submit the answer if you get some help from this video then subscribe my channel thank you for watching the video

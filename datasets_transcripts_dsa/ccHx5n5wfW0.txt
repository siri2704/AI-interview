to get pretty much any job in the software industry whether it's a typical programmer or a data scientist or a data engineer you're gonna need to know data structures and algorithms in my personal opinion the best course out there is the course by the same name from the university of california this course does have some prerequisites you're gonna need to know how to code in at least one popular language and have a bit of mathematical skills otherwise the recursion stuff is gonna be pretty confusing but by the end of the course you'll have everything you need to go on leak code hammer away those problems to really nail the coding interview

hi everyone welcome to the industry ready course on DSA and Oracle database with realtime project uh which is a new initiative by the exam prip tool you all already know that so we have already started the program started on March 16th some demo videos are going on and we are providing up to 50% of and very limited seats are available try to grab the opportunity and start your Learning Journey right you can reach out to us for more details uh ready number and my number so you can reach out to us we will provide more information and also you going to have a summer break right so try to utilize the opportunity and um enroll the program try to utilize the summer break very effectively right if you have any doubts you can reach out to us all right so we will begin with the topic so what exactly database and dbms means right can you tell me in the chart box what do you mean by the database and database management system exact difference difference the first question is first fundamentally so what is the purpose of database why we need database right why we need database tell me to store the data we will use the datab basis why we store the data for the future reference what do you mean by the future reference what what exactly the meaning of that why we need to store the data for the future reference can you tell me how it helps you if you store the data that is the First Fundamental question that you should ask yourself why we store the data for the future reference right what exactly meaning that meaning of that if you store the data in the database what happens in the future at any point of time you wanted to refer that particular data right if you store then it will become easy to refer the data how do you refer the data by querying by writing some queries SQL queries right and you can analyze the data based on your requirement eventually you can take the effective decision making right that is the purpose of database right purpose of storing the data right what is the definition of the database can you tell me now you understood purpose what is the definition of the database you might have seen different different definitions right but we will understand in a more depth in a clear way what exactly the meaning of the databases try to understand the terminology very carefully if you understand this definition then half of your work is done for the today's class right see here see here so what is the meaning of the uh definition of the database a database is a very well organized and structured collection of logically interrelated data let me repeat again okay database is a well organized structured collection of logically interrelated data right that is stored electronically in a systematic manner in the next class we will try to break each and every word and we will understand what do you mean mean by the well organized and structured collection of logically inter related data what exactly the meaning of logically interrelated data what happens if you don't organize the data properly what happens if there is no structure for the data right it is not only understanding the DAT uh definition theoretically but practically you need to understand in a more uh deeper way right then only it will become easier for you to learn the subject are you getting let me repeat the definition a database is a well organized and structured collection of logically interrelated data that is stored electronically in a systematic manner are you getting yes so now why database is designed okay now you are saying the database is a well organized and structured collection of interrelated data that is storing somewhere right what happens if you store data proper way proper organized and structured way right data management will become more easier right what do you mean by the data management right it will facilitate you to retrieve the data from the database very fastly right understand carefully data retrieval from the database becomes very easy you can say very effective very quick right and also if you want to modify the data if you want to modify the existing data in a database it will become more easier and also you can do it in a more secure way right only after IED persons can only modify the existing data that is what I say that data security data integrity and data consistency will be always maintained okay are you getting database is designed to facilitate effective data retrieval and insertion and any modification in terms of update and management of data while ensuring while ensuring what data Integrity data security and data consistency so each and every word we are going to see in later point of the course are you getting but now understand what do you mean by the data integrity and data consistency little bit without elaborating in a more detailed way because if if I elaborate in a more detail way it will become very lengthy lecture so instead of that let me quickly uh cover what what do you mean by the data security data consistency and data Integrity right suppose you have a database right now you wanted to modify the data can you tell me if any other person comes unauthorized person comes and modify the data so what do you what do you say any unauthorized person can modify the data if it is a traditional way of storing the data then there is a chance that there may be chance there may be chance if it is a file system if you're storing the database in data in the file system there may be chance that sometimes it may happen but database must ensures no unauthorized person can access the data only if you are authorized person then only I will allow you to modify the data it will say clearly that is the purpose of the main purpose of the database one of the important criteria criteria and characteristic of the database right and data consistency what do you mean by the data consistency now you are doing the transaction uh in the any banking transaction imagine now in the database so whenever you do the transaction right any banking transaction immediately you can check the all every places in your accounts it will reflect immediately right how is it is happening in the background database is the reason for that are you getting database is the reason for that that is what the data Integrity also comes under same category it will maintain accuracy of the data right okay in a simple terminology you can say you can say database is a kind of repository or maybe the digital platform where you are storing the data for the future references and you can take properly data from the databases and analyze it for Effective decision making right the same thing right and also I can say database is the one of the more more more more critical component one of the most important component in the modern software applications or maybe the business systems on top of databases not only database developer there are so many other uh set of people also users maybe developers are working it may be the um data of bear housing people ETL developers data analyst and power ba Developers for reporting generating the reporting and all right and all the data related roles are depends on major majorly on databases only try to understand that is why we have come up with a very unique course which is not only Our intention is not only providing the basic fundamental SQL queries or maybe the procedure no it is not like just like another course not only we are giving the in-depth knowledge in databases and also we are going to provide you the realtime project for that we are going to give the certificate also maybe if you want internship certificate we going to provide you internship certificate or if you have any career graph you wanted to um bridge that career graph with real experience if you contact if you tell your concern properly so we going to provide you the experience certificate also try to understand we are going to provide you the experience certificate also with that experience you can enter into the it very easily we will we going to guide you properly are you getting okay let us understand and take and take an example of library and understand and correlate with the database okay let us let us assume you are in a library Library contain the huge um Books Okay the math you library with contain so many books understand carefully when you enter into the library what you see there's so many books right if You observe carefully always the books are organized suppose let's say you in University Library so books are organized in a proper way department wise and category wise right agree now you can consider this category as a tables category as a tables and books as a data and every book it there must be one unique number will be assigned if it very well organized Library if it is a very well organized Library definitely there will be inte some some number will be some ID will be assigned to the each book right book ID you can say for each category it is divided and right in that the books are AA ailable with a proper book IDs right are you getting so if you arize if you organize the like this so then what happens it will make you super easy to find the book whatever that you are looking for in the library right now suppose let's say you wanted to pick the one book related to the machine learning right then what you will do you can go to that particular category which is a table and if you know the already the book ID then you can pick the easily that category you can take that book very easily right isn't it what I am saying see observe carefully when you are in a library you you always you might have noticed that it is very well organized right meaning the books are organized into the different categories different section Department wise and each book is assigned with a some number right some integer number unique identifier you can say book ID similarly you can correlate with this example you can relate with this example with a database are you getting just like how you are going how you are picking taking the book very easily from the library similarly you can take the data from the databases very easily right are you able to relate this example with the database right okay you can say simply databases are a smart library for Digital Data isn't it okay right now let us understanding let us understand the characteristics of the dat database okay any database in the world observe carefully any database in the world if it is a good database then it must agree all this it must have all these characteristics try to understand carefully by looking at the icons you can you can identify the points also right now let me tell you one by one okay so let me ask you one question okay what makes the database so smart right what makes database so smart what are the exact characteristics of the database now you already seen in the definition I was talking about uh in the definition database is a very well uh organized and structured collection of logically interrelated data right what do you mean by that from that definition can you tell me one point one important characteristic right structured organization okay structured organization what is that meaning data is stored in the different formats try to understand here I'll tell you one important thing data is stored in different format it may be the tables try to understand it may be the tables it may be in a document format it it may be in a key value P formit or maybe so and so so so many other things will be there so don't think that when the data is storing in the database means not only in a table or format there will be other options also there based on your business requirement project to project the way of storing the data will change understand let me repeat again based on your business requirement right project to project there may be the way of storing the data will change don't assume that database means only storing in the table format yes I agree if you say if you come and you say I am using the relational database management system rdbms then you can say that yeah data is stored in the table format what if I say in a mango DB what if I pick some other DB C or something like that right the way will change way of storing way of organizing the data will change so in academics majority of the cases we don't cover uh faculties may may not cover this point because the time is limited they don't cover all other category databases okay they'll mostly cover the relational databases we will see what are the different types of databases in next slide but now we will understand what are the different character characteristics of the database right so what is the first point here structured organization what does that mean data may be stored in a in a different in a in a in the form of tables or maybe in a document format maybe in a key value pairs all right what is the next thing data Integrity what does that mean we have seen in the previous slides we talking about the data Integrity right what does that mean it maintain accuracy and consistency right suppose let's say there is a table which is storing the student marks student marks and and the requirement is you should uh this particular table store this particular students marks column must be an integer number right at any point of time it becomes netive what will happen you losing the consistency of the data right you're not following the exact business rule so that is what I say if any good databases it must satisfy the data integrity and data consistency right that is the one of the important characteristics of the database what is the next data security right we have seen already that if you enter into that uh Library so only what will happen the first thing whether you are authorized person or not they will check right so in the database also if you if you are user of the database or if you are the authorized person then only it will enter into the database to check the database or modify the data are you getting only authorized persons can access the data if it is if the person is unauthorized if user is unauthorized then it won't allow at all right that is what security restricts the unauthorized access are you getting what is the next Point efficient access efficient access what does that mean it provides the fast retrieval of the data how it provides the fast retrieval of the data can you tell me if you organize the data in a proper format for example take an example of rdbms relational database management system okay R dbms assume the table is having the indexes then what will happen it will speed up the retrieval of the data it will speed up the retrieval of the data you can get the data very easily very fastly very quickly are you getting one more important characteristic of the uh dbms database is what date data redundancy reduction it will minimal it will minimize the data redundancy wherever necessary there only it will keep the data otherwise it will it won't allow at all it will eliminate the duplicate data in simple way you can say no repeated junk data are you getting so these are the very very important characteristics of the database okay wherever you see where whichever databases so definitely you're going to talk about these points only right now let us understand what are the different types of databases different examples of the databases now see here I was talking about relational databases and other databases right previously now if you talk about the there are three these are the major categories I can say there are so many categories are there I feel that these are the relevant uh databases for you uh because these are the most mostly used databases the frequent databases I can say like I said previously in one of the slide So based on your business organization based on your requirement project requirement the based on the way that you are going to store the data your manager is going to pick the databases accordingly are you getting suppose let's say you wanted to store the data in a table format what is the easiest way what is the easiest way that you can pick e just database you can pick my scalar postgress it is a open source database suppose let's say you wanted to go for a licensed version more robust and more popular database you can pick Oracle database are you getting suppose let's say now you wanted to store the data in a document format are you getting you wanted to store the data in a document format then you can go for mongod DP which is a no SQL database category sometimes people call it as a document database also now if you if you want your database as more scalable more High available databases now you can go for a cloud database category try to understand this category very very important being a computer science students you must know what are the different types of databases available and which is the most famous database available in the market category wise right now let us understand that this particular slide carefully observe these are the rankings rankings of the different databases category wise you can use the filters and you can get the uh different uh categories just reach out to me ping me in WhatsApp I'll will provide you the um exact link for this uh website okay you can see Oracle is the very very oldest database no database is in the world no database in the world is able to beat the Oracle database let me repeat no database in the world is able to compete with the Oracle database it is very very oldest database and very robust database and most popularly used database in the industry in the category of relational database management system R dbms it is a number one database are you getting try to take the screenshot if you want very very important slide all right right you can see vacle is the number one the next immediately MySQL is MySQL which is also taken by the Oracle data Oracle Corporation only and the Microsoft SQL Server that is also very popular and the postgress database which is a open source database that is also nowadays very popular once you learn one relational database right so then learning remaining relational database becomes dead easy it is a cake work and nowadays snowflake also very good in the market that is also one of the relational databases once you learn like I said like once you learn one relational database completely it's not like learning only uh joints and subqueries right majority of the people while they're in colleges they're learning only up to join subqueries maybe the views and they're ignoring the part that there is a in the database there is one more component is there the plsql if you consider the uh Oracle database that means you are extending the um procedural programming language capabilities to the SQL right being a computer science students you must aware of the fact that so you need to apply the intelligence to the your SQL queries by writing the procedures functions and then some optimization related points I mean Concepts to your um requirement maybe whatever may be the business requirement right okay all right then we will move ahead and understand what is the next thing database management system now you have seen the definition of the database uh databases right what is that tell me please comment in a com uh in a chart box what is the meaning of the definition of the database a database is a well organized try to understand the terminology I'm repeating intentionally because it's very very important a database is a organized and structured collection of logically interrelated data okay then what do you mean by the database management system here dbms tell me yes many of many of you already know that uh what is the meaning of the dbms database management system try to understand carefully here a database management is a software that interacting with the databases for what purpose it is interacting with the database can you tell me it is interacting to store the data in the databases dbms is a software that is communicating with the databases for what purpose to store the data in the database to retrieve very effectively from the databases and to manipulate the data whatever may be the operation maybe insert maybe update maybe delete that is what a manipulation and also you also seen that good databases must enforce the security ensure the data security and access control right it must ensure data Integrity how how tell me in your uh dbms in your academics you may be having a um transaction management right transaction and concurrency control management right so there you have studied acid properties right acid properties right right and what is the other point database dbms must handle concurrency for multiple users what does that mean tell me yes still me it supports the many users at once without crashing concurrently concurrency control okay it must support many users at once without crashing the system right yes same definition we will extend and we will understand in a different way okay dbms is a software that acts as an intermediat between users or applications and the databases users here means developers assume applications here means the application programs maybe the frontend UI based uh screens and that you going to see right that one database dbms sits between the users or maybe the uh or application programs and database are you getting yeah same thing same thing what happens if if you don't have a dbms what happens if you don't have a dbms what happens tell me without dvms then you need to write application programs or maybe the database management system related programs to interact with the database raw files what happens if you write everything from scratch cost of development will become very very high if you are working in the project there will be always one point that they will always think only about how can they reduce the cost cost of the development are you getting if you write everything everything from this CR then what will happen there are lot of things security issues will come lot of inconsistency inefficiency development cost will increase budget will increase automatically right nobody will going to agree that are you getting that is why let me tell you one point important thing so now you are storing the database in uh data in the databases right you have a business organization now you are whatever the data related to that particular business organization you are storing in the wi database right like that there are so many business organizations in the world right every business organization is storing the data in the database right if they wanted to refer some data any business owner or business organization want to refer some data from the database that what will happen what will happen what they will do tell me they will communicate with the database right they will communicate with the database assume okay they have to communicate with the databases right how they will communicate with the database can you tell me e for right so now what I'm saying the business organizations are always storing the data in the databases right but if they want to refer the data from the databases every time then what will they have to communicate with the database right to refer the some data every time they have to communicate with the database right if they don't have a database then what will happen it will become very very complex to understand the right how they interact how the storing and everything in background it will become really difficult right they it user can't understand each and everything that is there in the database right because it doesn't allow directly interaction direct interaction all right now what is the common requirement here every time you need to communicate with the database to refer the data to get the data every business organization to get the data it has to communicate with the databases so that is why there are so many vendar come came forward and they designed a um software called database management system to fulfill this requirement to get the database data from the databases properly to store the data in the databases properly very effectively so so many vendors in the market they came forward and they created their own dbm softwares for example if you take about take Oracle Corporation it came up with the Oracle databases and Microsoft SQL server and open source software like post SQL and then MySQL there are so many vendors came in the market and they have given us the software right now take an example of same Library example respect to the dbms what does that meaning now in the database uh while we discussing the database we have seen that Library we have related that database definition with the what library right now now here understand carefully what do you mean by the exactly dbms if you understand this example then over right now see here what is the first step that you when you enter into the library can you tell me right what what they will do librarian will ask you whether you are a authorized person or not authorized students or not whether you belong to the same college or not or whether or maybe same department or not right you are going to show uh your ID card and then you can right they will ensure you you are belong to this department only right ensuring that you belong to the same Department right exactly right what will happen next now we wanted to get some book he wanted to take some book from the library what you will do once the security that authorization is done right then you can able to see that that all the books are organized in a proper way right the librarian will do the uh the proper organization of the books and ensuring that there is no repeated duplicate books with the same number same number I mean in the library there will be a category wise organization of the books with this integer number unique integer number for each and every book ensuring that there is no duplication of the books book ID I mean when the books are organized in a proper category in a proper way then what will happen identifying the right books that whatever you want becomes very easy isn't it identifying the books WR book becomes easy right exactly that is where the librarian uh will come into the picture like in terms of you can correlate with the dbms with the librarian what librarian is doing he is ensuring the security by checking your ID card and also he is only organizing the data properly I mean books properly right whether the books are organized or not he's going to verify all those things right and if you want particular book then he will guide you go to that particular section that is the book ID of the book ID they will give you and then you can easily identify the book right that is what query execution to find the right book so if you have a book ID then finding the book right book becomes very easy why it is very well organized right now you you can understand here you can you can correlate with the example that so library is a database and librarian is a kind of dbm software okay ensuring the security data organization query execution properly query execution I mean like speedly you can pick the book right exactly right now you have seen the definition of the database and database management system these are the few questions for your assessment you can go through the questions try to give us answers in a chat box or maybe in comment box we will try to give you the answer back and otherwise in the next session we we going to see in a very very detailed way what exactly the uh things what exactly the meaning of the well organized or well structured or what exactly the meaning of the logically interrelated data okay and one more important things to to motivate you to encourage you suppose let's say now you you have a you created one social media application and which database you are going to select whether you're going to select relational databases or no SQL database what is the reason for that one the next important question next one more question is now you want you created one chart application chart application which category of database you are going to select and why can you answer and one more uh question so what is the ideal characteristics the best best characteristics of the good database right please answer all this uh if not answer at least try to think by yourself like okay you wanted to store the more of video kind of thing like Instagram uh more of video sharing platform right uh I mean uh real sharing platform how which database is used in a background why what is the reason you wanted to store more of PDF kind of document kind of things which database you are going to select and also before closing the session let me tell you in the market in the market in majority of the organization 80 up to 85% of the databases are more more more of more of like relational databases only but yeah there are very very big organizations which is working on so many other things right like social media application if you see more of more of video sharing right exactly if you take the Instagram the users will be there user likes will be there user post will be there user real will be there video category like how the things are happening in background which database is there how how it is working right try to think try to think okay okay so now we will encourage you to write whatever the answers that you you got right all this question try to write answers in the LinkedIn try to tag Us in the LinkedIn tag our exam PR tool page and uh and other people and if you have any questions or concerns please try to reach out to us we will try to help [Music] you all right thank you guys thank you for your attention

let's take a example so we have this unsorted array and if you want to sort this we're just going to say unsorted do sort so let's see what this sort does so it takes a compare function used to determine the order of the elements okay so we have an example over here if we take this array and we take a call back something like this and we have a and b so if you take a comma B and I'll say a minus B so this should sort as the array so if let's say a is this and B is this as a is this B is this so a minus B it's positive value right so what will happen if the positive value is there then it will put B before a that is it's sorting from ascending in in the ascending order so if I now console log this it will do this for every single element un sorted and run this you're going to see it has sorted this in the ascending order but if we were to do let's say B minus a that is we were to do 2 - 5 then it will do it in the descending order that is just like this

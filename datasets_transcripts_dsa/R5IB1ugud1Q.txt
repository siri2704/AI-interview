When I Was preparing for coding interviews back in 2018 I would go through algorithm problems in a random order and just try to solve as many problems as I could a lot of the time I would get to a problem and have no idea how to solve it even after looking at the solution I could not understand it hundreds of problems later I realized my mistake if you're trying to solve a backtracking problem for example it's going to be really difficult unless you already have a really good understanding of trees this is obvious in hindsight but a lot of people make this mistake M and that's exactly why I created this road map so you don't make the same mistake I did it's like a video game you shouldn't go to the next level until you're ready it shows you the best order to learn topics with several practice problems for each every problem has a detailed video solution and code solution in several languages including python Java JavaScript C++ and more I really think this is going to help you out because since 2022 it's already been used by over a million people you can check it out for free on n code.

These anomalies can be removed with the process ofNormalization, which generally splits the database which results in reducing the anomalies in the database. ### Removal of Anomalies\nAnomalies in DBMS can be removed by applying normalization. Normalization involves organizing data into tables and applying rules to ensure data is stored in a consistent and efficient manner. By reducing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity, normalization helps to eliminate anomalies and improve the overall quality of the database\n\nAccording toE.F.Codd, who is the inventor of theRelational Database, the goals of Normalization include:\n\n\u2022 It helps in vacating all the repeated data from the database."

In Lossless Decomposition, we select the common attribute and the criteria for selecting a common attribute is that the common attribute must be a candidate key or super key in either relation R1, R2, or both. Decomposition of a relation R into R1 and R2 is a lossless-join decomposition if at least one of the following functional dependencies is in F+ (Closure of functional dependencies)\n\n\n### Example of Lossless Decomposition\n\u2014 Employee (Employee_Id, Ename, Salary, Department_Id, Dname)\n\nCan be decomposed using lossless decomposition as,\n\n\u2014 Employee_desc (Employee_Id, Ename, Salary, Department_Id)\u2014 Department_desc (Department_Id, Dname)Alternatively the lossy decomposition would be as joining these tables is not possible so not possible to get back original data. \u2013 Employee_desc (Employee_Id, Ename, Salary)\u2013 Department_desc (Department_Id, Dname)\n\n\n```python\nR1 \u2229 R2 \u2192 R1ORR1 \u2229 R2 \u2192 R2\n```\nIn adatabase management system (DBMS), a lossless decomposition is a process of decomposing a relation schema into multiple relations in such a way that it preserves the information contained in the original relation."

The process of specialization to refine an entity type into a subclass is also an example of this strategy. For example, we may start with attributes and group these into entity types and relationships. The basic example is the process of generalizing entity types into the higher-level generalized superclass.

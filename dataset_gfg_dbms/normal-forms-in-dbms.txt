Normal forms are the essential principles used to organize data efficiently and eliminate redundancy. They help to ensure that the database structure is logical, consistent and optimized for performance. By breaking down data into smaller, related tables and defining clear relationships between them, normal forms reduce duplication and improve data integrity. This process is crucial for creating databases that are easy to maintain, update, and query making them a fundamental concept for anyone working with databases.

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and update anomalies.


### Normalization
Normalization is a systematic approach to organize data in a database to eliminate redundancy, avoid anomalies and ensure data consistency. The process involves breaking down large tables into smaller, well-structured ones and defining relationships between them. This not only reduces the chances of storing duplicate data but also improves the overall efficiency of the database.

Normal Forms

• A relation in BCNF is also in 3NF , a relation in 3NF is also in 2NF and a relation in 2NF is also in 1NF.
• A relation in BCNF is considered fully normalized.

By following a series of rules called normal forms (such as 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF) normalization ensures that the data is logically organized and maintains its integrity. For example, it prevents issues like inconsistent updates or deletion errors by ensuring that each piece of data has a single, clear location.


### Important Points Regarding Normal Forms in DBMS
• Purpose of Normal Forms:To organize data efficiently, eliminate redundancy, and prevent anomalies during data operations like insertion, deletion and updates.
• Types of Normal FormsFirst Normal Form (1NF):This is the most basic level of normalization. In 1NF, each table cell should contain only a single value, and each column should have a unique name. The first normal form helps to eliminate duplicate data and simplify queries.Second Normal Form (2NF):2NF eliminates redundant data by requiring that each non-key attribute be dependent on the primary key. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to other columns.Third Normal Form (3NF):3NF builds on 2NF by requiring that all non-key attributes are independent of each other. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to any other columns in the same table.Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF that ensures that each determinant in a table is a candidate key. In other words, BCNF ensures that each non-key attribute is dependent only on the candidate key.Fourth Normal Form (4NF):4NF is a further refinement of BCNF that ensures that a table does not contain any multi-valued dependencies.Fifth Normal Form (5NF):5NF is the highest level of normalization and involves decomposing a table into smaller tables to remove data redundancy and improve data integrity.

• Dependency EliminationNormalization focuses on removing unnecessary dependencies like partial, transitive or multi-valued dependencies.
• Reduced Redundancy:Eliminating duplicate data saves storage space and minimizes inconsistencies.

Note: A design that has a lower normal form than another design has more redundancy.

Normal forms reduce duplicate data, make data more consistent and improve how a database works. However, too much normalization can make the database design and queries more complicated. It’s important to find a balance between keeping the database organized and easy to use.


### Advantages of Normal Form
• Reduced data redundancy:Normalization helps to eliminate duplicate data in tables, reducing the amount of storage space needed and improving database efficiency.
• Improved data consistency:Normalization ensures that data is stored in a consistent and organized manner, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.
• Simplified database design:Normalization provides guidelines for organizing tables and data relationships, making it easier to design and maintain a database.
• Improved query performance:Normalized tables are typically easier to search and retrieve data from, resulting in faster query performance.
• Easier database maintenance:Normalization reduces the complexity of a database by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tables, making it easier to add, modify, and delete data.

Overall, using normal forms in DBMS helps to improve data quality, increase database efficiency and simplify database design.


### First Normal Form
First Normal Form (1NF) ensures that each column in a table contains single, indivisible values, and each row is unique. A table violates 1NF if it has composite or multi-valued attributes, such as multiple phone numbers in one cell. 1NF simplifies data, making it consistent and easy to manage.

### Second Normal Form
A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and any non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is not partially dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table. In other words, we can say that, every non-prime attribute must be fully dependent on each candidate key.A functional dependency X->Y (where X and Y are set of attributes) is said to be inpartial dependency, if Y can be determined by any proper subset of X.

### Third Normal Form
A relation is in Third Normal Form (3NF) if it is already in Second Normal Form (2NF) and does not have transitive dependencies for non-prime attributes.Below mentioned is the basic condition that must be hold in the non-trivial functional dependency X -> Y:


```python
X is a super key.orY is a prime attribute (each element of Y is part of some candidate key).
```

Question:Find the highest normal form of a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) with FD set as {BC->D, AC->BE, B->E}

Step 1:As we can see, (AC)+ ={A,C,B,E,D} but none of its subset can determine all attribute of relation, So AC will be candidate key. A or C can’t be derived from any other attribute of the relation, so there will be only 1 candidate key {AC}.

Step 2:Prime attributes are those attributes that are part of candidate key {A, C} in this example and others will be non-prime {B, D, E} in this example.

Step 3:The relation R is in 1st normal form as a relational DBMS does not allow multi-valued or composite attribute. The relation is in 2nd normal form because BC->D is in 2nd normal form (BC is not a proper subset of candidate key AC) and AC->BE is in 2nd normal form (AC is candidate key) and B->E is in 2nd normal form (B is not a proper subset of candidate key AC).

The relation is not in 3rd  normal form because in BC->D (neither BC is a super key nor D is a prime attribute) and in B->E (neither B is a super key nor E is a prime attribute) but to satisfy 3rd normal for, either LHS of an FD should be super key or RHS should be prime attribute. So the highest normal form of relation will be 2nd Normal form.


### BCNF
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a advanced version of Third Normal Form where one column depends on another, unless the first column is a candidate key (a column or combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row). The basic condition for any relation to be in BCNF is that it must be in Third Normal Form.

In simpler words, if any column in the table determines another column’s value, the determining column must be unique (a candidate key). BCNF fixes any issues left by 3NF

We have to focus on some basic rules that are for BCNF:


```python
1. Table must be in Third Normal Form.2. In relation X->Y, X must be a super-key in a relation.
```
Read more aboutBCNF.


### Fourth Normal Form
Fourth Normal Form contains no non-trivial multivalued dependency except candidate key. The basic condition with Fourth Normal Form is that the relation must be in BCNF.

The basic rules are mentioned below.


```python
1. It must be in BCNF.2. It does not have any multi-valued dependency.
```
For more, refer toFourth Normal Form in DBMS.


### Fifth Normal Form
Fifth Normal Form is also called as Projected Normal Form. The basic conditions of Fifth Normal Form is mentioned below.


```python
Relation must be in Fourth Normal Form.The relation must not be further non loss decomposed.
```
For more, refer toFifth Normal Form in DBMS.


### Applications of Normal Forms in DBMS
• Data consistency:Normal forms ensure that data is consistent and does not contain any redundant information. This helps to prevent inconsistencies and errors in the database.
• Data redundancy:Normal forms minimize data redundancy by organizing data into tables that contain only unique data. This reduces the amount of storage space required for the database and makes it easier to manage.
• Response time:Normal forms can improve query performance by reducing the number of joins required to retrieve data. This helps to speed up query processing and improve overall system performance.
• Database maintenance:Normal forms make it easier to maintain the database by reducing the amount of redundant data that needs to be updated, deleted, or modified. This helps to improve database management and reduce the risk of errors or inconsistencies.
• Database design:Normal forms provide guidelines for designing databases that are efficient, flexible, and scalable. This helps to ensure that the database can be easily modified, updated, or expanded as needed.


### Some Important Points about Normal Forms
• BCNF is free from redundancy caused by Functional Dependencies.
• If a relation is in BCNF, then 3NF is also satisfied.
• If all attributes of relation are prime attribute, then the relation is always in 3NF.
• A relation in a Relational Database is always and at least in 1NF form.
• Every Binary Relation ( a Relation with only 2 attributes ) is always in BCNF.
• If a Relation has only singleton candidate keys( i.e. every candidate key consists of only 1 attribute), then the Relation is always in 2NF( because no Partial functional dependency possible).
• Sometimes going for BCNF form may not preserve functional dependency. In that case go for BCNF only if the lost FD(s) is not required, else normalize till 3NF only.
• There are many more Normal forms that exist after BCNF, like 4NF and more. But in real world database systems it’s generally not required to go beyond BCNF.


### Conclusion
In Conclusion, relational databases can be arranged according to a set of rules called normal forms indatabaseadministration (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, and 5NF), which reduce data redundancy and preserve data integrity. By resolving various kinds of data anomalies and dependencies, each subsequent normal form expands upon the one that came before it. The particular requirements and properties of the data being stored determine which normal form should be used; higher normal forms offer stricter data integrity but may also result in more complicated database structures.

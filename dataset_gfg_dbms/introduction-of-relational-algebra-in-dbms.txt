Relational Algebra is a formal language used to query and manipulate relational databases, consisting of a set of operations like selection, projection, union, and join.  It provides a mathematical framework for querying databases, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Relational algebra serves as the mathematical foundation for query SQL.

• It provides a clear, structured approach for formulating database queries.
• Helps in understanding and optimizing query execution plans for better performance.
• SQL queries are based on relational algebra operations, making it essential for learning SQL.
• Enables complex queries, like joins and nested queries, that are critical for working with large datasets.

Key Concepts in Relational Algebra:

• Relations: In relational algebra, a relation is a table that consists of rows and columns, representing data in a structured format. Each relation has a unique name and is made up oftuples.
• Tuples: A tuple is a single row in a relation, which contains a set of values for each attribute. It represents a single data entry or record in arelational table.
• Attributes: Attributes are the columns in a relation, each representing a specific characteristic or property of the data. For example, in a “Students” relation, attributes could be “Name”, “Age”, and “Grade”.
• Domains: A domain is the set of possible values that an attribute can have. It defines the type of data that can be stored in each column of a relation, such as integers, strings, or dates.


### Operators in Relational Algebra
Relational algebra consists of various operators that help us fetch and manipulate data from relational tables in the database to perform certain operations on relational data. The fundamental operators in relational algebra, such as selection, projection, and join, are essential for querying and transforming data efficiently within a relational database.

Operators in Relational Algebra


### Basic Operators
Basic operatorsare fundamental operations that includeselection (σ),projection (π),union (U),set difference (−),Cartesian product (×), andrename (ρ). These operators are used to manipulate and retrieve data from relational databases.

1. Selection(σ):Selection Operationis basically used to filter out rows from a given table based on certain given condition. It basically allows you to retrieve only those rows that match the condition as per condition passed duringSQL Query.

Example:

Consider the relationRas follows:

For the above relation,

σ(c>3)(R)will select the tuples which have c more than 3.

Output Table:

Note:The selection operator only selects the required tuples but does not display them. For display, the data projection operator is used.

2. Projection(π):While Selection operation works on rows, similarly projection operation of relational algebra works on columns. It basically allows you to pick specific columns from a given relational table based on the given condition and ignoring all the other remaining columns.

Example:Suppose we want columns B and C from Relation R.

π(B,C)(R)will show following columns.

Note:By Default, projection removes duplicate data.

3. Union(U):Union Operator is basically used to combine the results of two queries into a single result. The only condition is that both queries must return same number of columns with samedata types. Union operation in relational algebra is the same as union operation inset theory.

Example:Consider the following table of Students having different optional subjects in their course.

FRENCH

GERMAN

For the above relations, the query:

π(Student_Name)(FRENCH) U π(Student_Name)(GERMAN)

will give usoutput table:

Note:The only constraint in the union of two relations is that both relations must have the same set of Attributes.

4. Set Difference(-):Set difference basically provides the rows that are present in one table, but not in another tables. Set Difference in relational algebra is the sameset difference operationas in set theory.

Example:From the above table of FRENCH and GERMAN, Set Difference is used as follows:

π(Student_Name)(FRENCH) – π(Student_Name)(GERMAN)

Note:The only constraint in the Set Difference between two relations is that both relations must have the same set of Attributes.

5. Rename(ρ):Rename operator basically allows you to give a temporary name to a specific relational table or to its columns. It is very useful when we want to avoid ambiguity, especially in complex Queries. Rename is a unary operation used for renaming attributes of a relation.

TableR:

ρ(D/B)Rwill rename the attribute ‘B’ of the relation by ‘D”.

Output Table:

6. Cross Product(X):Cartesian product Operator combines every row of one table with every row of another table, producing all the possible combination. It’s mostly used as a precursor to more complex operation like joins.

Example:Cross-product between two relations. Let’s say A and B, so the cross product between A X B will result in all the attributes of A followed by each attribute of B. Each record of A will pair with every record of B.

RelationA:

RelationB:

RelationA X B:

Note:If A has ‘n’ tuples and B has ‘m’ tuples then A X B will have ‘n*m’ tuples.


### Derived Operators
Derived operatorsare built using basic operators and include operations like join, intersection, and division. These operators help perform more complex queries by combining basic operations to meet specific data retrieval needs.

1. Join Operators: Join operations in relational algebra combine data from two or more relations based on a related attribute, allowing for more complex queries and data retrieval.

Types of Joins in Relational Algebra:

(a) Inner JoinAn inner join combines rows from two relations based on a matching condition and only returns rows where there is a match in both relations. If a record in one relation doesn’t have a corresponding match in the other, it is excluded from the result. This is the most common type of join.

• Conditional Join: A conditional join is an inner join where the matching condition can involve any comparison operator like equals (=), greater than (>), etc.Example:JoiningEmployeesandDepartmentsonDepartmentIDwhereSalary > 50000will return employees in departments with a salary greater than 50,000.

• Equi Join: An equi join is a type of conditional join where the condition is specifically equality (=) between columns from both relations.Example:JoiningCustomersandOrdersonCustomerIDwhere both relations have this column, returning only matching records.

• Natural Join: A natural join automatically combines relations based on columns with the same name and type, removing duplicate columns in the result. It’s a more efficient way of joining.Example:JoiningStudentsandEnrollmentswhereStudentIDis common in both, and the result contains only unique columns.

(b) Outer JoinAn outer join returns all rows from one relation, and the matching rows from the other relation. If there is no match, the result will still include all rows from the outer relation withNULLvalues in the columns from the unmatched relation.

• Left Outer Join: A left outer join returns all rows from the left relation and the matching rows from the right relation. If there is no match, the result will includeNULLvalues for the right relation’s attributes.Example:JoiningEmployeeswithDepartmentsusing a left outer join ensures all employees are listed, even those who aren’t assigned to any department, withNULLvalues for the department columns.

• Right Outer Join: A right outer join returns all rows from the right relation and the matching rows from the left relation. If no match exists, the left relation’s columns will containNULLvalues.Example:JoiningDepartmentswithEmployeesusing a right outer join includes all departments, even those with no employees assigned, filling unmatched employee columns withNULL.

• Full Outer Join: A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right relation. If a row from one relation does not have a match in the other,NULLvalues are included for the missing side.Example:JoiningCustomersandOrdersusing a full outer join will return all customers and orders, even if there’s no corresponding order for a customer or no customer for an order.

2. Set Intersection(∩) :Set Intersectionbasically allows to fetches only those rows of data that are common between two sets of relational tables. Set Intersection in relational algebra is the same set intersection operation in set theory.

Example:Consider the following table of Students having different optional subjects in their course.

RelationFRENCH:

RelationGERMAN:

From the above table of FRENCH and GERMAN, the Set Intersection is used as follows:

π(Student_Name)(FRENCH ∩ π(Student_Name)(GERMAN)

Output Table:

Note:The only constraint in the Set Difference between two relations is that both relations must have the same set of Attributes.

3. Division (÷):Division is used to find tuples in one relation that are related to all tuples in another relation. It’s typically used for “for all” queries.

Example:We have two tables

Student_Course (Dividend Table):

Student_ID

Course_ID

101

C1

101

C2

102

C1

103

C1

103

C2

Course (Divisor Table):

Course_ID

C1

C2

Query is to find students who are enrolled in all courses listed in the Course table. In this case, students must be enrolled in both C1 and C2.

Student_Course(Student_ID, Course_ID)÷Course(Course_ID)

Output Table:

Student_ID

101

103


### Relational Calculus
Relational calculusis a non-procedural query language used in the context of relational algebra. It focuses on what data to retrieve, rather than how to retrieve it, making it different from relational algebra, which is procedural. In relational calculus, queries are expressed using logical formulas that describe the desired result, without specifying the exact steps to get there.

There are two types of Relational Calculus

• Tuple Relational Calculus(TRC)
• Domain Relational Calculus(DRC)

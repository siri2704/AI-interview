Databases and data are the fundamental building blocks of new technology. Data is the building blocks of information, like numbers, words, pictures, and more, that computers use and process.Databases, on the other hand, are like organized libraries, making sure this data isstored,retrieved, andmanagedeffectively.

In this article, we’ll explore the differenttypes of databasesfrom the classicSQLto the trendyNoSQLand evenCloud databases. We will also explore the different databases for web development, backend development, mobile development, DevOps, data engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and even blockchain/web 3.0.

### What are Data & Databases?
Datarefers to any piece ofinformation. It can benumbers,words,images,sounds, or any other information that a computer canstoreand process. Data can be raw or processed.

Adatabaseis a structuredcollectionof data that is organized in a way to facilitates efficientstorage,retrieval, andmanipulationof information. It acts as a centralized and organized repository where data can be stored, managed, and accessed by various applications or users.


### What is DBMS?
ADatabase Management System(DBMS) is asoftwaresystem that enables users todefine,create,maintain, andmanipulatedatabases. It provides an interface between the database and the users or applications, allowing them to access and manage data efficiently.



The primary functions of a DBMS include:

• Data Definition:Defining the database structure, including specifying data types, relationships between data elements, and constraints.
• Data Manipulation:Inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from the database using queries and commands.
• Data Security:Enforcing access control to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the data.
• Data Integrity:Maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data through validation rules and constraints.
• Concurrency Control:Managing simultaneous access to the database by multiple users or applications to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.
• Backup and Recovery:Providing mechanisms for backing up data and recovering it in case of system failures or data corruption.


### Types of Databases
There are various types of databases, each designed for specific use cases and requirements. Here are some common types of databases:


### 1. Relational Databases (SQL databases)
Relational databases(RDBMS) organize data into tables, where each table hasrows and columns. These databases usestructured query language(SQL) for defining and manipulating data.



These are the following relational databases:

• MySQL
• PostgreSQL
• Oracle (PL/SQL, programming language extension for Oracle Database)
• SQL Server
• SQLite
• MariaDB
• IBM Db2


### 2. NoSQL Databases
These databases are designed to handle large volumes ofunstructured,semi-structured, orstructureddata.NoSQLprovide flexible schema designs and often offerhorizontal scalability.

### 5. Time-Series Databases
Time-series databases are optimized forstoringand queryingtime-stamped data, such as sensor data,IoTdata, and financial market data.

• InfluxDB
• Prometheus


### 6. NewSQL Databases
NewSQL databases aim to combine the scalability and flexibility of NoSQL databases with the ACID compliance and SQL querying capabilities of traditional relational databases.

• CockroachDB
• Google Spanner.


### 7. Object-Oriented Databases
Object-oriented databasesorganize and store datain a way that reflects the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). In OODBs, data is represented as objects, which encapsulate both data and the methods or functions that operate on that data.

• db4o
• ObjectDB


### 8. Hierarchical Databases
Hierarchical databases organize data in atree-like structurewhere each record has one parent record and multiple child records, forming a hierarchy. Records are linked together inparent-child relationships, with each child record having only one parent.

• IMS (Information Management System)


### 9. Network databases
Network databases are a type of database model that represents data ascollections of recordsand sets, with relationships defined between records. Unlike hierarchical databases, where records form a strictparent-child hierarchy, network databases allow records to have multiple parent and child records, forming a network structure.

• IDMS (Integrated Database Management System)


### 10. Centralized Database
Centralized databases are a type of database architecture wheredataisstoredandmanagedin asingle locationor server. In this architecture, all data processing and management tasks are performed on the central server, and clients access the database remotely.

• ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method)


### 11. Operational Database
Operational databases are databases optimized for supporting day-to-day operations and transactional processing within an organization. They are designed to efficiently handle tasks such asadding,modifying, andretrieving datainreal-timeto support business operations.

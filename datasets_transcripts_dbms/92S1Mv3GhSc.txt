hi everyone welcome to go classes in this lecture we will continue our discussion of SQL so this is SQL complete summary part two remember in this SQL complete summary I discussing all the important Concepts all the important points all the type of questions all tricky questions everything so if you did not watch the main course of SQL then don't worry you can watch the complete summary and you can solve all the gate previous year questions you will be able to solve each and every gate previous year questions after watching this SQL complete summary so let's start part two the part one link you can find in the description so you can check it out so let's start now these are the recap you already know that in SQL our our table is a bag of tles yes or no in our table we can have duplicate rows you can easily see for example this row and this tle these are same tles they are duplicate so we already know that SQL works on the bag centic means in SQL every table is a multi set every table is a bag okay and remember if you apply the we condition okay for example here what this means this means c c greater than 6 okay so this is basically what this query means this query means that from this table R so if I apply this query that from this table r where okay those tles I select where C value is greater than equal to 6 okay select star means I'm projecting all the attributes okay this is star means I'm projecting all the attributes and this is the tle selection condition so if I apply you can see this query if I run on this table then this will be the output yes or no you can easily see this tle will be gone because this is the tle selection condition that c value must be greater than or equal to 6 so this will be the output you can easily see the output is also bag of tles in the output you can easily see that these tles they are same yes or no okay so very simple now let's move on now let's see null values in SQL this is our next topic how to handle null values in SQL so first of all what are null values you already know so null values have different different meanings remember in many different situations you can use this null value for example if you don't know the value then you can use null value like for example your grandfather birth date okay we don't know yes or no many many of us we don't know the birth date of our grandfather okay then in that case we can put null there okay so this is unknown yes or no so we can put null value if if the value is inapplicable then also you can put the null value for example if I ask you what is your Ferrari number okay your Ferrari or Lamborghini okay what is the number of that so that that will be null okay because that is in inapplicable to you can you understand the difference between these two for example your grandfather birth date okay that is unknown that is unknown we can put null value there but that exist right yes or no that will exist okay that exist definitely so there was a day when our grandfather he was born yes or no so definitely that exist but we don't know but we don't know the value so we can use null value Now understand this inapplicable value for example what is the what is the Ferrari number or Lamborghini number of my Lamborghini so that is inapplicable because I don't have Ferrari okay so that is inapplicable because my parari car does not exist I don't have that or empty placeholders for example whenever you are filling a uh whenever you are filling a form many times what you do you leave the column empty yes or no yes or no for example you are you are you are filling a form okay then this column you can keep it empty right without filling without recording the value you can move on okay so very simple that you can use null value in this type of situation also empty placeholders so very simple point that this same value null we can use in many different different situations okay means when we don't know the value we can use null when it is not applicable we can use null when it is absent or not recorded then we can use null so in different different situations we can use the null value is this clear very simple Point okay there are many different situations in which we can use null values okay null simply means that we don't know the value or the value does not exist or the value is not applicable or the value is not recorded okay so there are many different situations in which this null value can be used for example consider this question and tell me if employee dot if employee do spouse if that is null then what is the most probable situation tell me if employee do spouse in the employee table the spouse column okay in this employee table if the spouse column is null okay then what is the most probable situation can I say the spouse know spouse name is unknown no the most probable situation is this yes or no anyway don't worry in the gate exam they will not ask you but this is just for understanding okay this is just for understanding that in the employee table if I ask you if I say that spouse column is null for some employee okay for some employee Raju if the spouse column is null then it simply means that Raju is unmarried okay very simple so you can see the point is that we can use null value in many different situations okay now remember no one will ask you that uh this particular null value is used for which situation no one will ask you I'm just telling you that there are many different situations when we don't know the value or the value does not exist in those situations we can use the null value okay so null value has many different meanings okay yes or no these are most common meanings but there can be some other meaning also remember okay so null value has many different meanings now let's move on now one very important rule I want to tell you about null value that is arithmetic operation with null value the result will be null value okay this is a important result remember this is a important rule for null value for example if I ask you what is 50 + null what do you think what should be the answer see null value either it does not exist or this is unknown or this is not applicable so this null Value Plus 50 what should be the result the result must be null value okay very simple so null value remember if you do arithmetic operation this is arithmetic operation correct yes or no okay this is a arithmetic operation so arithmetic operation when I do with null then the result will be null okay so you can easily see the arithmetic operation with null that is null okay 50 plus null that is null now you tell me a very simple question I'm asking what is null multiplied by 0 tell me what is that null multiplied by 0 that is also null see there is no exception there is no exception remember one thing if you have null okay null with null if you do any arithmetic operation okay if you do any arithmetic operation okay this can be anything this can be anything then the result will be null so remember this can be anything okay so null multiplied by 0 that is also null okay for example if I ask you what is null minus 0 that is also null remember okay so for example if I ask you what is null minus null that is also null okay because remember this can be anything when I say anything this can be null or not null this can be null or not null this can be anything so with null if you do arithmetic operation then the result will always be null this is a very simple point if I ask you for example 0 divided by null what that will be 0 divided by null that also will be null okay so this is a very simple result this is a very important rule so remember whenever I perform arithmetic operator with null then the result will always be null there is no there is no exception for example null multiplied by 0 that will be null 50 multiplied by null null null divided by null null null minus 50 is null null minus 0 is null okay so very simple point now let's move on now tell me one more thing if I say that this in the question if I say that this is a column A okay this is your table R and this is column a I tell you that domain is integer I tell you that domain is integer okay now you tell me now you tell me the domain is integer remember now you tell me if I say that uh null minus 0 now what that will be if I tell you that domain is integer now tell me if I ask you what is null minus 0 now what that will be again that will be null remember arithmetic operation with null is always is n there is no exception is this clear okay so to confuse they can give you that okay this is integer this is anything whatever it doesn't matter whatever is the domain it does not matter compar is I can say arithmetic operation with null that is always null so very simple you can read it here for example null minus null that always will be null for example null multiplied by 0 that also will be null okay there is no exception remember so this domain is integer this is just to confuse okay so that you can you you will think okay domain is integer so if I multiply by zero then it should be zero but actually this will be null okay don't say that this is zero so very simple Point arithmetic operation with null is always null so this is the idea null arithmetic operation anything and this anything can be null or this can be not null the result is always null now let's move on now let's see aggregate operators in case of null values so far we have seen aggregate operators without having null values in the table now if you have null values in the table then how the aggregate operators will behave that is what we need to study okay so let me tell you that all the aggregate functions they ignore the null values they will ignore the null values okay remember all the aggregate functions but the only exception is Count star this count star will always count the number of tles in the table it will not ignore the null value okay so remember every aggregate function will ignore the null value but the count star this count star is special if you remember I told you in the last session that count star will always count the number of rows in the table okay it does not ignore the null value so it is special so remember always study this separately don't confuse count star with count of a okay so let me tell you here so all the aggregate operators they will ignore the null values for example for example if you have table R let's assume in this table R I give you this attribute a and let's assume you have these values for example 2 - 3 null 0 null okay so let's assume these are the tles now in this situation if I ask you what is what is count of a then what that will be what is count of a what that will be count of a remember this aggregate operation will ignore the null values so count of a will be three okay this will ignore the null values remember count star is special okay I told you in the last lecture also I told you that count star this is special this will always this count star this count star this will always count the number of tles in the table so that will be five so remember count star is special this count this count star okay don't mix this count star with the other aggregate operations all the aggregate operations other aggregate operations they behave in the same way they behave in the same way okay so for example count of a that will be three if I ask you what is sum of a what that will be sum of a remember aggregate operations aggregate functions they ignore the null values they will ignore the null values so what will be sum of a sum of a will be 2 - 3 + 0 okay so that will be minus one yes or no okay so very simple what what is Max of a that will be two what is minan of a that will be minus 3 what is average of a AVG of a that will be summation divided by count yes or no that will be summation divided by count so minus1 divided 3 is this clear to everyone so remember they will ignore null values they will ignore null values okay so all all the aggregate operators they will ignore the null values now you might be thinking sir why they are ignoring the null values are you thinking that why we have this rule in SQL we have this rule that all the aggregate operations all the aggregate functions they will ignore the null values but why they are ignoring the null values do you have some intuitive explanation intuitively can you understand very simple see just think about it if let's assume you have this table and in this table you have some some salary column okay some salary column now you tell me in this column let's assume there are thousand tles just think about it that there is a salary column and there are thousand tles and one of them is null and one of them is null maybe or maybe two of them are null and all other are not null okay all other are salary maybe 20 10 10 okay 30 so like that so now you tell me if I want summation of salary if I want to calculate sum of salary and think about it think about it if I don't ignore the null values then what will be the answer if I do not ignore the null values then what will be the answer if I do not ignore the null values see if I do not ignore the null values then null plus anything is null that you already know yes or no if I do not ignore the null values then null plus anything is null that you already know I told you arithmetic operation with null are always null this is what we have seen arithmetic operation with null the result will always be null so if I do not ignore the null values then the the result will be null do you agree with me okay this will happen if we do not ignore null values if this sum does not ignore null values does not ignore null values okay now just think about it there are thousand tles and I want to calculate the total salary this is what I want to calculate but because of one or two null values you can't calculate do you want that please tell me there are thousand tles I want to calculate the total salary but because of one null value because of single null value or maybe two null value because of them because of null values I cannot calculate the total salary that is that we don't want yes or no so this is the intuitive explanation forget about it you can forget about it okay so just remember that SQL will always ignore these aggregate functions will always ignore null values okay in SQL aggregate functions they will always ignore null values but count star is special this will always count the number of tles in the table I told you that count star this is exception this will always count the number of tles in the table so all these aggregate functions count Su Max mean AVG they will behave in the same way and this is a special this is a special aggregate function okay so don't mix this count a count star do not mix them I told you do not mix them okay you can put a Meme here for example this count what this will say to count star you know there is a meme we are different okay don't include me in your category so very simple there is a meme if you remember gangs of vur movie meme so you can put here okay that we are different so remember these are these are different don't mix them same same but different yes same same but different okay so let's move on now let's see if I have distinct then what will happen for example let me give you let me give you let me give you two here and let me give you some value minus 3 here now you tell me if I put count distinct a then what will be the answer count distinct a what that will be remember this count will ignore the null values who will ignore the null values this count will ignore the null values so first you ignore the null values now you now you count the distinct a so that will be answer will be three yes or no because this count will ignore the null values first you ignore the null values because this count will ignore the null values then you count the distinct values of a so the answer will be three yes or no if I ask you what is sum of distinct a what that will be again this sum will ignore the null values then you count the summation of distinct values of a so the summation of distinct values of a that will be minus one okay if I ask you what is Max distinct a that is same as Max a that is same as Max of a and that will be you ignore the null values this Max will ignore the null values then you find the max value the max value that that will be two yes or no what will be the Min value mean of distinct a that is same as mean of a okay and that will be minus 3 remember this mean this will ignore the null values first first you ignore the null values then you find the minimum value okay what will be AVG of distinct a so this AVG it will first ignore the null values then you find the average of distinct values of a okay so AVG of distinct a that will be sum of distinct a divided by count of distinct a so the answer will be min-1 divid 3 is this clear very simple right okay now you tell me what will be count star what will be C St this will always count the number of tles in the table okay so for this the answer always will be seven is this clear so very simple point now let me tell you aggregate function on empty table if you have empty table then what will happen so that is what we need to see if you have empty table then what is going to happen so let's assume you have a table R and in this you have this column A okay maybe you have multiple columns and this is a empty there is there is no tble this is empty table now if this is empty table then then what are the rules now first of all you tell me what is the count star because this is a special this will always count the number of Tes in the table okay so first you tell me this so what is Count start this will count the number of tles in the table so that is zero number of tles is zero yes or no there is no tle so number of tles is zero now look at the remaining okay so there is a rule that if I ask you what is count of a then what that will be for empty table count this will be zero okay count of a will be zero and for the remaining the answer will be null for example if I ask you sum of a that will be null if I ask you AVG of a that will be null if I ask you Max of a that will be null and if I ask you minan of a that will be null is this clear okay so these These are the rules remember when you have empty table in case of empty table these are the rules is this clear these are the rules so very simple remember count of a will be zero when you have empty table then count of a will be zero but the remaining you can easily see they will be null for example if I ask you what is count of distinct a what is count of distinct a now tell me it doesn't matter it will it will again be zero count of distinct a that will again be zero okay and for the remaining if I put distinct it doesn't matter that will be null if I put sum of distinct a that will be null if I put mean of distinct a that also will be null okay is this clear to everyone please tell me so these are the rules when you have when you have empty table in case of empty table what will happen these are the rules okay and what is Count star distinct count distinct star what that will be count distinct star that is invalid yes or no okay so this count star is special so if I put distinct count distinct star this is invalid and if I put for example example count star some some variable some attribute a some attribute a now these are invalid these are invalid okay is this clear so remember they are invalid so count star is special count star has no variations count star is simply counting the number of T in the table okay yes or no there is there is no no I can say there is no hidden Point here count star has no hidden secret Point okay this is very simple count star this is the single semantic uh syntax this is the only syntax you cannot use distinct you cannot use attribute name this is the syntax and meaning is also very simple that count number of a number of rows it will count number of rows in table it will not Neo it will not ignore the null values it will always it will always do this so very simple I hope you understood all these points so remember when you have empty table if you have empty bag then the count value will be zero and for all the remaining aggregate operations the result will be null okay you can easily see the count value will be zero when you have empty table but for all the remaining aggregate functions you can see the answer is null if you have empty table is this clear simple right now you tell me the answer for this question let me know the answer for this question suppose we have a relation R AB with one tle this is the only tle null null now both the components are null now you tell me what will be the value of sum of a if I ask you what is going to be the value of sum of a okay so tell me for example in this case you tell me what is sum of a see just apply the concept that you know what is the concept concept the concept is I am asking sum of a okay so what you will do very simple sum of a that will ignore the null value or not this will ignore the null value right okay very simple this will ignore null value ignores null values do you agree with me this will ignore the null value so first it will ignore the null value if you ignore the null values then what it will become this sum this will ignore the null values now once you ignore the null values then what you will get you will get empty table yes or no first you ignore the null values now after ignoring the null values we get empty table correct I can say after ignoring null values null values of a we get empty table and for empty table what is the sum value we get empty table yes so no and remember for empty table what is the sum value that will be null so the answer is that sum of a that will be null I hope this point is clear is this clear let me know so remember the aggregate operation this aggregate function this will ignore the null values so once you ignore the null values this null value once you ignore then you will get empty table and for empty table the sum equal to null that you already know now you quickly tell me so sum of a will be null what will be count of a that will be zero remember count will ignore the null value you will get the empty table and for the empty table the count is zero yes or no now one interesting point what is Count star one interesting point what is Count star this is special this will always count the number of tles in the table so the answer will be one yes or no is this clear so that is the reason don't mix count star and count a yes or no do you agree with me they are of different category don't mix count star count a they are different study them separately this is special you can consider this special okay so count a that will be zero why because count a this count will ignore the null value now this column A is empty for empty table the count value will be zero that you already know okay now you tell me what is mean of a that also will be that will be null mean of a will be null okay now you tell me what is AVG of distinct a that also will be null I hope all these points are clear to everyone right agree for example if I give you this table let's assume you have a table a b okay and you have all the all the tles of a are null null null okay and let's assume here you have two null 2 okay let's assume this is what you have now you tell me in this situation quickly tell me all the all the answers you tell me for example first of all you tell me count Star first of all you tell me count star that will be three that will be number of tles yes or no now you tell me what is what is Count star of B what is Count star of B this is invalid yes or no this is invalid that you already know this is invalid okay now you tell tell me what is count of a see count of a what it will do this count will ignore the null values of a ignore the null values of a now this a is empty for empty the count is zero okay yes or no next next what is count of B what is count of B this count will ignore the null values of B so now the count of B that will be what that will be two okay now if I ask you what is count of distinct B count of distinct B this count will ignore the null values of B now you count the distinct values of B so that will be one okay so very simple now you tell me about sum what is sum of a this sum will ignore the null values of a for empty table the sum is null for empty table the sum is null that you already know okay very simple if I ask you what is sum of distinct a distinct B if I ask you the sum of distinct B this sum will ignore the null values of B now you calculate the sum of distinct values of B so that will be two okay so I hope all these points are clear to everyone everything is clear right very simple so let's move on now we have seen all these points we have seen you can check it out now let's move on now let's see null values in SQL so far we have seen aggregate operations or I can say aggregate functions are they clear aggregate functions in case of null values okay everything is clear let me know I have taken all the variations related to aggregate operations aggregate functions now let's see null values in SQL how to handle null values in SQL so far if you if you remember in the last lecture in the SQL summary part one we did not consider the null values do you agree with me so far most of the time we did not consider null values in the tables but now we will consider the null values in the tables now we will see null values in SQL and their effect on anything else okay on all the concepts what will this null value how the null value will affect this is what we need to study okay so now we will study null values in esql and their effects on everything else so first of all let me tell you what are arithmetic operations and what are comparison operations do you understand the difference between them for example if I ask you this addition is this arithmetic operation or comparison operation AR this addition addition is arithmetic operation this subtraction is arithmetic operation division multiplication these are arithmetic operations yes or no agree for example logarithm this is arithmetic operation yes or no all these points all these things these are arithmetic operations now you tell me about comparison operations what are comparison operations let me know what are the comparison operations in SQL we use only these arithmetic operations so you can forget about this but this is also arithmetic operation okay so you tell me about the comparison operations for example for example a is equal to B is this comparison or not are you comparing them are you comparing them yes we are comparing them yes or no for example a is less than b are we comparing them are we doing comparison yes we are doing comparison so comparison operations are for example equal to not equal to remember remember this is same as not equal to this is the symbol for not equal to is this clear this is a symbol for not equal to symbol for not equal okay is this clear so this is the symbol for not equal okay what about this less than this is less than this is less than equal to this is greater than this is this is greater than this is greater than equal to okay yes or no so these are the comparison operations I hope all these points are clear okay arithmetic operations comparison operations now let me tell you very important rule about null values okay just understand these two rules and you can solve any question based on null values what are the rules these are the important rules arithmetic operation with null value the result will always be null value if you perform arithmetic operation with null value then the all then then the result will always be null value and when you perform comparison with null value then the result will be a new truth value that is unknown okay so remember arithmetic operation with null value result is always null value comparison operation with null value the result is always a new truth value that is called unknown now you might be thinking what this unknown means let me tell you what are the truth values that you know what are the truth values that we know truth values for example you know this is a truth value true okay this is a truth value false yes or no normally this is what happens the truth values in Boolean algebra can I say in propositional logic in Boolean logic agree with me in the propositional logic or in the bullan algebra these are the truth values but in SQL there are three truth values SQL has three truth values so let me tell you truth values in SQL truth values in SQL so there are three truth values in SQL one is true you can write it t another is false you can write it f another is unknown this is a truth value you can write it U is this clear so remember SQL uses three three valued three valued logic remember in the propositional logic in the Boolean algebra we use these truth values true comma false okay but SQL uses three valued logic means in SQL there are three truth values those are true false unknown okay one more thing I want to tell you that see look at this second rule comparison with null is unknown means what it means for example if I do a null less than 50 what will be the answer tell me and if I do null + 50 what will be the answer tell me the answer here tell me the answer here see this is arithmetic right yes or no this is a arithmetic operation so arithmetic operation with null value what will be the result this is arithmetic operation arithmetic operation with null value the result will always be null value okay this is comparison right this is comparison operation comparison operation with null value the result is unknown okay what is this unknown this is a new truth value remember remember this unknown this is a new truth value is this clear this is a new truth value so remember the difference null plus 50 is null and null less than 50 is unknown means this is comparison operation comparison with null that is a truth value that is unknown okay is this clear is this point clear for example what is null multiplied by0 that is null that is null very simple but you tell me what if I write null is equal to Z now this is arithmetic operation and this is unknown correct yes or no now this is comparison now this is comparison so this will be unknown this is comparison so this will be unknown very simple all these points are very simple for example what is null less than equal to null what that will be again that will be unknown okay because this is comparison so the result will be unknown I hope all these points are clear okay for example what is 0 divided by null now this is arithmetic this is arithmetic so the result will be null simple all these points are very simple now one thing I want to tell you many students they don't understand the difference between null and unknown null versus unknown are they same are they same tell me are they same if they are same then why are we doing so much examples yes or no why are we doing so many examples correct okay just think about it if they are same then why do we have two different rules there is no need of two different rules okay so remember there is difference null comma unknown they are different okay what is null tell me what is null this is a missing value can I say can I say this is a missing value tell me null is a missing value or either you can say null is a missing value or you can say this is not known value we don't know not known value or this is not applicable value yes or no not applic basically null has many different meanings do you agree or not recorded value not recorded value so null has many different meanings I can say null is basically a missing value something that is missing that is missing null is a missing value what is this unknown this is a truth value this is a truth value is this clear this unknown this is a truth value okay because there are three truth values one is T one is f another is unknown that is U unknown or you can say U these are the truth values okay so remember unknown is a truth value and this null this is a missing value so I hope you understood the difference so if I say for example if you say many students they casually say I have seen many students they casually say that okay null Less Than Zero so comparison this is comparison okay so the result will be null is this correct is this correct this is wrong okay remember null if you do comparison comparison with null is a truth value that is unknown okay this is a truth value that is unknown that is unknown similarly remember if I do if I do arithmetic with null for example if I do null plus 50 then some students they casually say they casually say okay that this is unknown but this is wrong null + 50 is actually null okay so very simple point I hope you understood this so null versus unknown they are different null is a missing value or not known value or not applicable value or not recorded value null has many different meanings okay but unknown this is is a this is a truth value because SQL uses three valued logic I told you okay so let's move on now so very simple point you can see this is screenshot from the man book this is screenshot I've taken from the man book okay so you can easily see that arithmetic operator with null that result will be null okay but when I do comparison with null then the result will be unknown and this unknown is a truth value this unknown is another truth value like true comma false okay this is another truth value like true comma false now we will study the properties of this unknown this is what we need to study now okay is this clear so far everything is clear so let's see now we will see the three truth values in SQL okay we will see their property these are the truth values true false unknown these are the truth values so first of all let me tell you that sql's three valued logic what it means it means SQL uses three valued logic remember okay whenever you have null values then there are three valued logic SQL uses what are these three what are these three valued logic what are these three truth values tell me in SQL in SQL we have three truth values because SQL uses three valued logic okay and those are T comma F comma U very simple now we will see the property of this U because you already know the property of true comma false yes or no property of true comma false I already know for example true and true tell me what is that that is true you already know for example true and false what is that that is false if I ask you what is false or false that is false false or true that is true so you already know the properties of true comma false but what we need to see we need to see the properties of unknown do you agree with me so now we need to see for example if I do true or unknown then what that will be okay we need to see the properties of unknown for example if I if I do false and unknown then what that will be if I do unknown or unknown what that will be okay and so on so this is what we need to study now I hope this point is clear so let's move on so remember we know that comparison involving null values that will result the result will be a truth value that is unknown now we need to see the properties of this unknown we must study we must learn the properties of this truth value unknown so let me tell you this is actually very simple so let's quickly see see there is a trick there is a trick to remember the properties of unknown trick to remember okay trick to remember properties of unknown so what is this trick okay what is this trick let me tell you the trick is something like this that this true you consider this as one this true you consider as one okay this false you consider as zero and this unknown you consider as what this you consider as something middle half okay okay yes or no so remember you can this is a trick to remember the properties of unknown true consider as one false consider as zero unknown you consider as 1 by two now now this is very simple that if you do and okay anything and anything for example remember this X and Y then what will be the result if I do X and Y then the result will be result will be whichever is minimum minimum of them okay whichever is minimum of them minimum of X comma Y is this clear so remember and that simply means minimum of X comma Y and if I do or then what I will get X or Y then just find the maximum of X comma y just find maximum of X Comm y this or you find maximum okay and if I ask you not not of X then what you will what you will find if I ask you not of X then you will just Calculate 1 - x not of X will be 1 - x okay if I ask you not of X then that will be 1- 1 - x so this is property this is the trick to remember the properties is this the concept is this the concept or is this just a trick this is just a trick this is not a concept okay actually see let me tell you this is just a trick actually all the properties see all the combinations they are actually already defined means for example what is true or uh unknown false and unknown actually these are defined okay these are already defined we cannot we cannot do anything these are already defined by the SQL who decided what will be true or unknown who decided SQL who decided what this value will be SQL so remember these are actually defined but to remember them we have a trick so this trick is just to remember the properties of unknown okay and don't worry this Pro this trick is given in all the standard resources okay like you can see this is man book in this man book also the same thing is given you can see the rules are easy to remember with a trick okay if you want to remember the rules then you can use this trick so very simple this is the trick that and means you just take the minimum of both of them or means you take maximum of both of them and not means 1 - x and remember true means one false means zero unknown means 1 by two okay is this clear now you quickly tell me all the things for example let's assume X and Y okay these two I'm taking I'm asking three things I'm asking what is X and Y I'm asking what is X or Y I'm asking what is not X okay so let me take let me fix x x I fixing true okay so x i fixing true remember now I have y either can be true or it can be false or it can be unknown now you tell me the answer what is true and true this is very simple this is true that you already know but can you apply the trick you can apply the trick right you can apply the trick because true means one see true means one right and what is and and means Max sorry and means mean and means minan so what will be true and true okay that will be mean of them mean of 1 comma 1 that will be one okay so you can apply the trick what is true or true that will be true because or means Max yes or no true means one or means Max so if I ask you what is true or true so that will be Max of 1 comma 1 that will be one and that means true so the answer is true what is not of true that will be 1 minus one that will be zero that means false okay not of true is false so you can just apply this trick note of X is 1 - x so for example if I ask you remember true is 1 okay so if I ask you what is not not of X is 1 - x so if I ask you what is not true so that will be 1 minus 1 so that will be zero and zero means false and zero means false okay so very simple you can just apply the trick now you tell me true and false that you already know false true or false that will be true negation of true negation of true will be false okay what is true and unknown let me know true and unknown please tell me what that will be I'm asking true and unknown remember true means one unknown means half and and means min so you just take mean of them mean of mean of 1 comma half so that will be half and that is unknown so your final answer is unknown okay this is unknown what is what is true or unknown let me know true or unknown that will be true okay easily you can do true or unknown true or unknown so that will be Max Max of 1 comma half that will be one that is true simple okay and what will be negation of true that is false that you already know okay not of X so now you similarly you tell me now I'm fixing this x to you unknown okay now you tell me true false unknown what will be the answer so for example let me know U and T U and T that will be U just take the mining U or t just take the maximum negation of U remember not of U that will be 1 minus u 1 - half that will be half half means U so this is unknown yes or no similarly U and F that will be F okay U and F that will be F U or F that will be U okay so negation of U that is u u or U U and U tell me U and U so that is Max that is minimum of them that is minimum of them minimum of half comma half that is half and that is half means unknown so this will be unknown U or U that will be maximum so that will be U this will be U okay so like this you can do agree now similarly if I fix this as F false false false now you tell me quickly true false unknown now let me know the answer false and true that is false false or true that is true negation of false is true false and false that is false false or false that is false negation of false is true false and unknown that is false false or unknown that is unknown and false complement not a false that is true okay is the is clear to everyone please tell me so you can see and means you just take the minimum of them okay this is the trick you can see and means minimum or means maximum correct okay so you can easily see or means just take maximum and negation negation means 1 minus V so this is the trick and remember unknown is half true is one and false as zero so all these simple simple points you can easily understand so let me use different different colors I have many colors so I can do that okay so like this you can easily see okay let's move on now so this is the entire table you can easily check okay for example quickly tell me if I have ask you what is unknown and unknown unkknown and unknown that is unknown yes or no what is false or unknown that is unknown yes or no is this clear false uh unknown and true unknown and true that is unknown okay so you can easily see all these things and the note of unknown is unknown now let's move on now let's see where close in the where Clause we put the tle selection condition right where Clause means tle selection condition now this tle selection when when you have null values then how it will happen so let me tell you the answer the ve clause or I can say the tle selection condition that will satisfy if the answer is true okay if the condition satisfies true okay I can say if the condition evaluates to true then that row will be selected if the condition becomes false or unknown then that tle will be discarded is this clear very simple point that where Clause very simple where Clause will return a row whose result is true but if the result is unknown or result is false then that row will be discarded okay so very simple point so let me tell you that what this we Clause will do okay what this we Clause will do this will check tle by tle yes or no this this will check tle by tle tle after tle tle by tle okay independently that you already know now let me tell you if tle if if condition becomes if tle selection condition okay I can say that if this tle selection condition okay evaluates if this tle selection condition evaluates to false or unknown false or unknown now tell me if this tle selection condition evaluates to true false or unknown then then that tle will be what then that tle will be what then that tle will be will be rejected yes or no that tle will be rejected so when the tle will be selected tle selected only if condition becomes true tle selected only if condition becomes true this where condition becomes true okay is this clear to everyone please tell me so very simple remember where Clause will return only those tles for which the result is true if the result is false or unknown then that tle will be rejected okay let's see one example consider this consider this query consider relation R you have a relation r with single integer attribute a and this is the query now let me give you the table okay let me quickly give you the table so you have this table R and this is a now let's assume these are the values integer attribute right you you can have minus one 1 - one let's assume you have null you have null okay let's assume these are the tles is this clear now you tell me how many rows how many tles this query will give you in the output let me know number of tles in the output find find number of tles in the output so tell me what is that number of tles in the output pause the video write your answer in the comments so let's see so very simple from R this is the table R this is the conceptual evalation step number one yes or no step number one from R so this is your table R very simple Next Step number two is this so where this is your step number two okay and this is your tle selection condition this is the tle selection condition and what this condition is saying this is saying that a is less than equal to Z or a is greater than Z okay see it looks like that this will always be true yes or no do you agree with me it looks it looks like that this will always be true a is greater than Z or a is less than equal to Z it is looking like that this will always be true but something will happen if a is null if a is null then something else will happen because remember in SQL we have three truth values true comma false comma unknown okay yes or no so now let's see now you can easily see for this tle remember where this will apply tle by tle yes or no that you already know so let me write it here this where it will apply tle byle independently so let me write it here applies on every tle independently applies on every tle one by one individually or independently so now you tell me for this tle this condition will be satisfied or not let's call it condition C let's call it condition C okay so you tell me for this the condition will be satisfied or not yes so for this condition remember I can say the condition becomes what the condition C that will become what so let me write it here what this condition c will become so for this tle the condition c will become true for this tle the condition C will become true for this also true for this also true okay for all of them this will become true but now here something interesting will happen when a is null put a equal to null when a value is null then what will happen when a value is null then null less than equal to Z this is comparison or what null greater than zero see null less than zero this is comparison so the result will be unknown this is comparison so result will be unknown what is unknown or unknown what is unknown or unknown unknown or unknown that also will be unknown okay yes or no so remember for this tle the selection condition the tle selection condition this condition number c this will become unknown for this also it will become unknown okay so which tle will pass only these four tou will pass okay yes or no this these tles will fail simple so the number of tles in the output that will be four tles in output is this clear okay so the question is asking number of tles in the output the answer will be four This Is The Answer let's move on now you can read this the same thing is written here you can read this okay you can easily see this is your table X means this is the attribute X now tell me how many tles this query will give you what is the result of this query this is your attribute x what is the result of this query where X is greater than zero so this will for this tle this condition will be true for this tle this condition will be true for this tle this condition will be unknown so these two tles will will be will pass and this will fail you can see this will be the answer similarly if you have this if you have this query again the same thing for this tle this condition will be true for this tle this condition will be true for this tle this condition will be unknown so sorry for these this condition will be false sorry for these this condition will be false false okay and for this this condition will be unknown so all of them will fail so that is the reason you can see empty table you are getting yes or no you are getting empty table so that's it I hope you understood now let's move on now let's see SQL keywords that is is null is not null these two keywords we need to study so let's see now let's assume you have a relation with single integer attribute a okay assume we want to know how many null values are there in the column A this is what we want to know right yes or no in this a column how many null values are there we want to find how many null values are there this is what we want to find okay assume we want to know how many null values are there in the column A is this query correct please tell me can I write like this that from this R where a is equal to null can I do this where a is equal to null is this query correct the answer is no this query is not correct okay this query let me tell you this query is invalid this is illegal or I can say invalid query why this is invalid query because remember because we cannot use null as a operand this is invalid query remember this is invalid query because this query will give you error this is invalid query because SQL does not allow null as a operand we cannot use we cannot use null as a operand as a direct operand is this clear we cannot use null as a operand in the query in the query okay is this clear so very simple you are saying that a equal to null actually we cannot do that because basically what you are doing you are using this null as operand it's like for example if I put five then this is fine then it is fine because this is constant okay this is operand but this is not fine okay you cannot use null as a operand is this clear this is invalid query don't think some students are saying the result will be empty table some students are saying result will be empty table no this is invalid query this will give you error this is illegal SQL query this query itself is invalid SQL says we cannot use null explicitly as a operand okay so SQL gives you two facilities okay to check null to check null to check null value remember if you want to check null value then SQL gives you two facilities then SQL keywords are there this is what you can use okay you can use SQL keyword that is is null or you can this use this keyword is not null okay is this clear so these special these special facilities are given by SQL these are special facilities these are SQL keywords is null is not null this is what you can use okay is this clear please tell me you can use this keyword or you can use this keyword these fac ities you can use to check null but you cannot use null as a operand this null you cannot use as a operand in the SQL query in the SQL query this null cannot be used as operand so you can see SQL says we cannot use null explicitly as an operand okay so what you can do this query is fine yes or no is null is this clear so this is the correct query I hope you understood this query will give you how many null values are there in the column A from the table R how many tles have null value in the column A that will be your answer for example if your table R has let's assume this is your table R A and you have for example let's assume zero null minus1 null and two let's assume this is what you have or maybe again zero let's assume this is what you have so tell me in this query output will have how many tles number of tles in output what that will be number of tles in the output that will be so remember you can see a is null so these tles will pass yes or no do you agree this tle will pass the where this is the tle selection condition again this is tle selection condition this is a tle selection condition okay so this tle will pass this tle will pass these two tles will pass this tle will fail yes or no so finally your answer will be number of tles that will be two is this clear please tell me so SQL has this facility SQL provides you this facility is null is not null if you want to check null value okay now similarly tell me about this is not null this will give you how many nonnull values are there yes or no how many nonnull values are there so for that you can use is not null very simple so like this you can do okay in this case what will happen if you have table R and this is your a let's assume 0 null 0 null minus one okay then in this situation remember this will fail this will fail all the remaining will pass all the non null values will pass so this is what will happen okay and you know the count star the count star will count the number of rows yes or no this will always count the number of rows do you agree this will always count the number of rows that you already know okay number of rows this will count number of rows but remember but but remember first where Clause will apply remember please understand first this will happen conceptual EV variation then this will happen then this will happen right yes or no is this clear please tell me okay then this will happen in the conceptual evaluation first from Clause then where Clause then this last Clause okay is this clear so for this question the answer for this query how many tles in the output number of tles in output what that will be that will be number of tles in the output that will be three okay clear let me know so very simple okay the same thing in the previous query in the previous query remember this count star this will count the number of rows yes or no first this will happen then this will happen then this will happen correct okay so remember this count star will count the number of tles but first where Clause will happen yes or no is this clear let me know so let me ask you one more variation you tell me about this one from R from R where where a is null select select count a okay is this clear now you tell me if I give you this table I'm giving you this table I'm giving you this table R and this is the attribute a and let's assume you have this table null 0 null 0 minus1 null now tell me the answer let me know okay so very simple what will be the answer this is what I'm asking number of tles in the output simple question or I can say what is the output you just tell me that that okay what is the output you give me the output itself okay you give me the output itself give me the output so very simple Point remember first what will happen first in the conceptual evaluation first first this will happen then second this will happen Okay so what will happen is null so very simple this will fail this tle will fail this tle will fail this tle will fail correct this tle will pass this tle will pass this tle will pass okay now the third thing will happen is this this is the third thing count of a so what that will be so the output will be this count of a so you can see only these tles are passing okay null null null so this will ignore the null values this count will ignore the null values it will ignore all the null values you will get the empty table okay for empty table this count a this will be zero so your output will be this if I ask you number of tles in the output what that will be if I ask you number of tles in output what that will be number of tles in the output the answer will be one this is a tle right yes or no see this is a tle the tle value is zero but this is a tle so number of tles in the output that will be one is this clear to everyone please tell me okay so very simple remember the conceptual evaluation always follow the conceptual evaluation first from clause will happen then where Clause then select Clause okay always follow the conceptual evaluation now let's move on so we have seen all these points now let's see some questions based on the concepts that we have already seen let's see some questions now tell me the answer for this question you can see here c c is a in okay and you can see we permit the null values choose the statement below that describes the result of this SQL query this SQL query is given to you now what will be the answer you can easily see see this condition look at this condition and tell me for which tle this condition will be true for which tle this condition will be true this condition is becomes true okay yes or no this condition becomes true this condition is true if and only if null values if and only if okay for all c equal to null values yes or no I can say this condition is true for all non null values of c correct yes or no okay and for null values of c this will happen What for null equal for null values of c it is it is it becomes unknown it becomes unknown okay so finally I can say that you will get select star means you are getting all attributes we are getting all attributes okay so all rows where C is non null okay all tles where C is not null these tles will satisfy so the answer will be option D is this clear very simple question tell me the answer for this question this type of question has come in the gate exam in 2004 I think this type of question has come where they are asking you to assume something see we already know that SQL does not allow null to be explicitly used as a operant that we already know right SQL does not allow null as a operant in the SQL query that you already know so the following query is invalid do you agree the following query is invalid yes or no this following query a equal to null this is invalid illegal but for this question okay only for this question assume that null value can be used as operand okay just assume just assume for this question assume that null value can be used as operant means assume this is not this is legal assume this is valid query then how many tles will be there in the output how many tles will be there in the output let me tell you let me tell you the this column A okay let me give you the column A so let me give you for example 20 null null0 0 okay now you tell me so how many tles will be there in the output assume this query is valid assume this query is valid just for this question actually this query is invalid you already know this query is illegal but for this question assume that this query is fine now you tell me so what will be the answer so remember let me tell you this type of question has come in the gate exam in Gate 2002 or Gate 20 04 where they are assuming something which is not in SQL in this question we are assuming something which is not allowed by SQL similarly in a in a gate exam question they were asking to assume something which is not allowed in SQL okay this type of question has come in the gate exam that is the reason I'm taking this question so you tell me the answer so you can see first this will happen you already know in the conceptual evaluation first this will happen so this is your table R then second what will happen second this where will happen second this where will happen now you tell me for every tle you will check for every tle it is checked okay for every tle it is checked so let's check it for every tle okay so you tell me for this tle the this condition you tell me about the condition a equal to null what about this condition you tell me what this condition will become for this tle this is a comparison or not is this a comparison yes this is a comparison right okay a equal to null this is comparison this is comparison with null so for this the this condition will become unknown for this unknown for this unknown for this unknown for this unknown so all the tles will fail yes or no all the tles they fail okay so for this question the answer will be how many tles in the output answer will be zero is this clear please tell me number of tles in the output that will be zero is this clear to everyone because all the Tes will fail so now do you understand why we cannot use null as a operand now did you understand why null cannot be used as a operand is this clear why we cannot write a equal to null now did you understand why SQL does not allow null as a operant did you understand let me know okay so very simple Point Let's solve this question SQL aggregate function that gives the number of rows containing non null values for a given column which aggregate function gives the number of rows containing non null values for a given column so you can see the answer will be count okay so this is a simple question let's see this question which aggregate function returns count of all null values returned by a value expression so can I say count star or count so the answer will be this yes or no this will not ignore null values yes or no this won't ignore null values this doesn't ignore null values this doesn't ignore null values let's move on tell me the answer for this which is not aggregate function which of them is not aggregate function so you can see this average this is not aggregate function yes or no all these are aggregate functions all these are SQL aggregate functions okay so very simple tell me the answer for this which aggregate function does not ignore null values the answer will be count star count star does not ignore null values tell me the answer for this all these questions I found in some University assignment or on the check website okay so you can see all of them except who ignores the null values so the answer for this question answer will be option b you can read the question answer will be option b okay all of them will ignore the null values except count star now let's see the next topic that is the definition of duplicate tles in case of null values in case of null values what is the definition of duplicate tles when can you say that a tle is duplicate see let me give you one example let's assume you have this a b these are the two attributes okay some Tes I'm giving you you tell me for example 1 2 1 2 are they duplicate are they duplicate okay now let me ask you something interesting this null null null null are the duplicate let me ask you another interesting one null one null are the duplicate null one okay so which of them are duplicates see I want to tell you the definition of duplicate tles in case of null values in case of null values what are the definition of duplicate tles so tell me are they duplicate yes they are duplicate right okay there is nothing here they are duplicate tles okay what about the next one what about these two are they duplicate will you consider them duplicate are they duplicate the answer is yes they are also duplicate apples okay they are also duplicates see let me tell you that the definition is like this the definition of duplicate tles the definition of duplicate tles is like this that you can understand like this that from the human eyes see from the human eyes what is looking duplicate that is duplicate you can understand like this is this clear see this is the definition of duplicate tles you can see the definition of duplicate tle is very simple the SQL definition the SQL definition of duplicate tles I'm telling you the SQL definition of duplicate tles students are asking why null value see this is a exception read this this is a exception okay this screenshot is taken from cour or naati you can check it out either cour or naate I'm telling you the definition of duplicate tles okay this is a exception is this clear you can say this is anomaly what you are thinking is is written here there is a contrast yes or no null equal to null that is unknown null equal to null is unknown yes or no that is written here in this book that if you compare to null values then result will be unknown but in the context of duplicates you will consider them as duplicates is this clear please tell me what you are thinking that is already written here I understand your feelings but I'm just telling you the definition of duplicate tles in case of null values okay so this is the definition the SQL definition of duplicate tle that is two rows are duplicates if the corresponding columns are either equal or they both contain null read the definition the SQL definition of duplicate tles when can you consider tles as duplicate so two tles are duplicate let me do it here like this that two tles are duplic at if the corresponding column values are either equal or they both contain null okay is this clear so very simple words okay I can you can do like this see duplicate tles means if they are looking duplicate to human eyes like this you can understand duplicate Tes means if without thinking too much they are looking duplicate okay to humanize they look duplicate is this clear you can understand this is a trick you can take this trick that to human eyes they look duplicate okay the definition is very simple the corresponding columns must be equal or they must contain null so remember these are duplicate tles similarly these are duplicate tles these two are duplicate tles what about the last two what about the last to what about these are they duplicate please tell me what about these they are not duplicate right they are clearly Not Duplicate okay so that's it this is the definition of duplicate tles is this clear to everyone please tell me this is the definition of duplicate tle SQL definition of duplicate now what type of questions they can ask you for example see they can ask you this type of question select distinct select distinct star from R okay from relation R select distinct star now let's assume that this relation R has these tles a b null null 1 2 one2 and one null now tell me the answer let me know so here what will be the answer so number of tles in the output will be three okay is this clear so this is the definition of duplicate tles in case of SQL so we have seen all these points let's move on now so far did you understand everything please tell me did you understand null values we we have seen all about null values every concept related to null values we have seen every variation related to null values any tricky question related to null values so did you understand the null values let me know so very simple now let's move on now now we will study the new Clauses in the SQL that is Group by clause and having Clause these two new Clause we will study now first we will study group by Clause what is this group by the the name itself is telling you Group by okay you are grouping based on some attribute value you are making group based on some attribute okay so this is the name Group by let me tell you the syntax the syntax is like this first you will write select then you will write from then you will write where and then you will write Group by list of attributes this is the syntax is this clear so remember we are studying the new Clause the new SQL Clause so far we have seen so far we have seen select from where now we now we study group by so remember this is the syntax first you will write select in the select you will write attribute names then from here you will write the table names here you will write the where here you will write the tle selection condition and then you will write the group by list of attributes the name itself is telling you Group by means you are making groups by attributes okay so Group by attribute names for example you are making group based on ages yes or no so tell me intuitively you tell me what will happen from student table you are making group based on ages you are making groups based on ages intuitively what will happen intuitively you can think like this that all the people all the tles with same age they are in one group all the tles with same age they are in one group like this like this groups will be created yes or no all all the people all the students who have same age they are in a in a group all the students who who have same age they are in they are in the same group okay so this is very intuitive concept let me tell you yes cluster okay you can understand like this that clusters will be created clusters okay so all the students who have age 20 they are in the same group all the students who have age 25 they are in the same group like this so based on the AE clusters or I can say groups will be created so the name itself is telling you Group by you are creating groups based on AE based on the age the groups will be created okay the tles will be divided into groups okay is this clear very simple so this group by this is the most intuitive concept let me tell you because the name itself is telling you what will happen so now let me tell you that what is the what is the usefulness of group group by usefulness of group by so you are making group and then what is the usefulness why you are making group see this is the question that you should ask sir why are we making group this group by is making group that is fine but why we are making group so the answer is to get group by summary for each group we want to get summary okay very simple Point read this usefulness of group by Clause the group by Clause will give you groups it will give you groups but why we are creating groups what is the reason to create groups because we want Group by group group group wise summary groupwise summary means for example for each group for each group I want what is the average what is the average of this group what is the average of this group what is the average of this group so I want groupwise summary summary means aggregation yes or no summary means aggregation that you already know aggregation means summary summary means aggregation so I hope this point is clear that remember Group by will create groups for example these are the people who have age 20 these are the people who have age 20 these are the people who have age 25 okay and let's assume these are the people who have age is 40 okay so these are the groups we created but why we are creating the groups I I am answering this question what is the usefulness of creating the group why we are creating groups to get group wise summary we want to get group wise summary for example I want average age of each group for this age for this group what is the average for this what is the average for this what is the average or I can say for this what is the maximum age for this what is the maximum age actually not maximum age because age is 25 I can say for this group what is the I can say what are the maximum marks okay in this group what are the maximum marks in this group what are the maximum marks so like that I hope you understood the point so Group by close we are creating groups so that we can get group wise summary summary means aggregation we want to apply the aggregate function on each group on every group we want to apply aggregation function read this consider this query we are creating group based on ages yes or no based on ages groups will be created then what we are doing for each age for each age group we are creating the average average of GPA for these people what is the average of GPA for these people what is the average of GPA for them what is the average of GPA like this is this clear for each group we are finding the aggregate function for each group we are finding the summary I hope this point is clear for example look at this consider the relation student student ID name State marks this is the student table now read this query and tell me what comes to your mind when you read this query what will come to your mind find the average marks of all students state wise means for each state find the average marks for every state for every state find the average marks so tell me you will create the group based on what let me know you read this query and tell me you will create the group based on what yes based on state very simple see for each state for each state I want average marks okay so what I will do very simple from this table from from this students table okay what I will do I will create group by first of all do I need where clause in this query do I need to do I need to remove some tles do I need to filter some tles no okay so where Clause is not required okay so from students what I will do I will do group by I will create group group by what group by state yes or no because for each state this tells you grouping okay this is the phrase for grouping this is the phrase for grouping this is giving you the idea of grouping that for each state means this is the this is the phrase for grouping we are creating group based on ages based on state for each state now what this will do this will create groups based on State this is the group of Rajasthan this is the group of Tamil Nadu this is the group of Maharashtra and so on okay is this clear so based on state groups are created then what we will do we will select we will output what we will output for each state we want average marks for each group we want average of marks is this clear yes or no for each state what are the average marks for each group what is the average marks tell me one thing for one group how many tles will be there in the output for one group like this is the group of Maharashtra okay these are the students of Maharashtra for them I want average marks so for one group how many tles will be there in the output in the output you will have Maharashtra average marks of Maharashtra so for one group one tle for one group one tle in the output is this clear very intuitive concept right I'm telling you this group by close is very intuitive okay and one thing I want to tell you this is a trick that when to create basically for which attribute to create groups okay how to find okay so for which attribute we want to create for which attribute for which attribute we need to create group how to know for which attribute we need to create groups how to know the answer is the answer is this phrase to each to each something something something then something something something okay to each state for example to each state or for each state yes or no so I can say for each okay for each so this for each and if you are writing a then something something something it simply means that you will create group based on a yes or no so the answer this phrase will tell you that that we need to group we need to create group based on a is this clear so create group so Group by a I can simply say so Group by a is this clear let me know I'm saying that read this question in this question you can easily see for each state I want something for each state I want some data okay for each state I want a summary so it means I will do the grouping based on state okay yes or no based on state I will do the I will do the grouping so this is what I'm telling you for which attribute we need to create the groups how to know this phrase will help you for each a something something something so you Group by a okay this is just a this is just a guideline understood did you understand this guideline okay let's move on now so very simple point we need to create groups we need to create okay so state wise we will do the grouping and for each group we will find the summary means for each group we will find the average marks average marks means summary okay this is aggregate you can call it aggregate or you can call it summary so very simple now let's move on so usefulness of group by that is Group by group wise summary okay every group for every group we want summary so what I can say I can say for every group how many tles so for every group one tle in the output is this clear one tle in the output for every group we will get one tle in the output okay actually let me tell you when we study having Clause when no having Clause okay this will happen when you have no having clause don't worry we will study having Clause actually what having Clause will do having Clause will remove some groups see we will create groups first we will create groups then having Clause will remove some groups okay but remember for the remaining groups one tle for each remaining group is this clear one tle for each remaining group I can say so when no having Clause okay actually there is something called having Clause this we will study don't worry having Clause we will study what what is the work of having Clause this having Clause will filter some groups means first you will create groups then some groups will be removed by this having clause for the remaining groups one tle will be in the output okay for the remaining groups there will be one tle in the output so so far we will not consider having Clause so assume there is no having Clause then for every group one tle in the output okay because we are doing groupwise summary group wise wise aggregation easy easy concept now let's move on now first let's understand what grouping means for example this is your table R now if I say Group by a then then what it means tell me will it happen that all these all these Tres will will actually suffle it will it happen see I'm asking when I say Group by a then will it happen then will it happen that all the tles will shift like all the tles they will they will exchange their place or I can say okay yes or no will they shift no they are not shifting remember actually see Group by a this will give you a virtual partition okay this is a virtual grouping remember actually the grouping will not happen this is just a virtual grouping for our understanding this group by a this is virtual ual grouping virtual grouping of tles is this clear there will be imaginary grouping of tles means whenever you are solving any question you can you can do this type of virtual grouping okay like this for example Group by a we are we are doing grouping by a so you can see here a value is same okay so these tles in one group okay and this tle in another group so how many groups will be created okay yes or no how many groups G1 G2 two groups will be created but remember this is just a virtual grouping is this clear this is just a imaginary grouping two groups will be created imaginary two groups are created I can say like this it is a imaginary grouping imaginary grouping okay for understanding you can understand like this that all these tles in one group all these tles in one group because we are grouping by a based on on a we are grouping so these are in one group and this is in another group so two groups will be created okay is this clear very simple for example here how many groups will be created just tell me this imaginary grouping of tles so tell me Group by a comma B how many groups will be created let me know I am grouping based on a comma B how many groups are created very simple here AB is same AB is same a is same so they will be in the same group 1 two one two one two they are in the same group okay and this tle in another group so again there will be two groups okay is this clear if I say Group by B then how many groups will be created if I say Group by B based on B you are grouping then again two groups will be created okay then again two groups will be created you can see we are doing grouping based on B then again two groups are created you can see these are same B Valu so they will go in the same group 1 2 1 2 1 2 and 3 4 again two groups are created if I do grouping based on B okay let's move on so you can see again I'm telling you relation with imaginary division of groups see for example Studio name if I do grouping based on Studio name means my query is this group by Studio name Group by Studio name okay if I write like this group by Studio name then what will happen you can understand like this that where Studio name is same those Tres are in the one group so this group will be created this is G1 this is G2 and so on okay is this clear so like this grouping will happen this is just a imaginary grouping to solve the question you can create group like this but it does not mean that tles will suffle okay the tles the rows they will they will exchange places it will not happen it is just a imaginary grouping okay we are not doing ordering like for example we are not we are not sorting yes or no we are not sorting that okay these tles will come fast then these tles will come no we are not sorting this is just a imaginary grouping okay for solving the question you can think like this that these are in one group these are in one group and so on because we are creating group based on Studio name okay so all the studio all the studio names where Disney is there Studio name equal to Disney these tles in one group these tles in another group so like this groups will be created okay tell me here if I do group by C how many groups will be there just tell me how many groups if I do group by C how many groups will be there just tell me that so you can see Group by C I'm grouping by C C values are different so four groups will be there okay four groups will be created very simple okay if I say for example Group by Group by BC or maybe AC Group by AC now you tell me the answer Group by AC Group by AC now how many tles how many groups Group by AC so you can see AC look at AC 1 5 3 6 1 78 all are different so four groups will be created okay very simple Group by AB how many groups will be created in this tle group by AB 1 2 1 2 one two so they will be in one group and this will be in another group so it is it will happen like this that ABC Okay C this group will be created where you have one to five 1 127 and 1 128 this will be group number one okay this this numbering I am giving this is not the actual numbering okay this is just for for my convenience I am giving this numbering okay don't worry that don't think that okay this will be group number one no no no there is no group number one there is no group number one there is no group number two okay this is just for understanding this is just for our understanding this is just imaginary grouping okay so you can think like this and another group will be like this another group will have Okay so this you can say G2 so two groups will be created and so on if I do group by ABC how many groups will be created then four groups will be created this in different this different this different this different so four groups will be created okay very simple now let's move on okay now let me tell you about null values if you have null values then how you will do the grouping okay for example let me give you a table R and in which there are two attributes a b let me give you some for example 25 25 2 null 2 null null null null null okay like this so let's assume you have this and maybe null three okay so you have this table is this clear now you tell me how many groups will be there if I say Group by a if I say Group by a how many groups will be created if I say Group by a see here a value is same so this will be one group okay yes or no this will be one group and actually for all the null values there will be one group okay for all the null values there will be one group so let me tell you the let me tell you the rule about null values when you have null values then to create grouping when you are creating a group treat this null value as a normal value to create the group remember null is treated as ordinary value when forming the groups when you are forming the groups then null value is treated like a ordinary value or I can say that all the Tes with null value will create one group all tles with null value will create one group so you can see if I say Group by a then what will happen if I say Group by a then one group will be cre created this this is one group will be created okay so in this situation this will be one group and the remaining these will be in one group okay because I'm doing grouping by a so you can see here a value is same so these tles in group one and here a value is null so these tles in one group so two groups will be created if I say grouping by B now tell me grouping by B how many how many groups you can see here B value is same so one group is this okay so this will be because B value is same right five five so this will be one group G1 okay this will be another group here B value is null okay so this will be G2 and this will be another group this will be G3 so three groups will be created is this clear so the null values in case of grouping did you understand in case of null values how to make group did you understand let me know very simple if I say Group by a comma B now how many groups will be created a comma B see here a comma B values are same so this is one group okay here this is your one group another group will be two n two n this is another group okay next another group will be null null this will be another group and null comma 3 that is another group okay so for this four groups will be created so very simple now let's move on now let's see SQL query template in case of group by when you have group byy then what is the query template okay understand this query template so the query template is like this you will have select comma from where those those things you will have prom will be there yes or no you already know from will be there where will be there okay where is optional right that you already know where is optional select comma from there mandatory select is there and group by is there first of all this is the syntax first you will write in this order you will write first you will write select then you will write from then you will write where then Group by and so on if there is nowh if there is nowhere then you can write select from group by this is optional this is also optional these are mandatory okay now one important thing I want to tell you here you will write only attribute names okay remember in the group by in the group by you can only write attribute names for example Group by A1 A2 okay Group by A1 A2 A3 let's assume these are the attributes Group by A1 A2 A3 now let me tell you something interesting that if you are grouping by A1 A2 A3 then this A1 A2 A3 must must come here unaggregated as it is this must come A1 A2 A3 must be here unaggregated these are here these are here okay but in the select Clause you cannot put anything else this you cannot put okay you cannot put any other unaggregated attribute so these attributes they must be same in the group by we have column names see you already know that in the group by here we have column names actually the template is like this group by here you will have column names or I can say attribute names or I can say attribute list yes or no here you will have attribute list okay unaggregated you cannot put aggregation here for example Group by AVG of a does it make sense Group by AVG of a does it make sense Group by a of a no that does not make sense okay so remember here you have attribute list okay this same attribute list let's call it this same attribute list will come here let's call this attribute list L this same attribute list will come here L okay this will come here and there will be aggregation and you can put aggregation aggregation you can put multiple times no problem okay so remember these attributes will come here as it is and there will be there can be aggregation so this is what I'm saying if you have A1 A2 A3 here then you have A1 A2 A3 here you cannot put A4 if you want to put A4 then you need to put aggregation so aggregation you can put for example you can put like for example you can put summation you can put summation based on A4 no problem aggregation you can put on anything for example you can put count you you can put count on A1 no problem is this clear so aggregation you can put on any attribute you can put aggregation on any attribute you can also put count star if you want there is also no problem you can put count star okay is this clear please tell me so I hope this point is clear so remember you cannot do this that here you have these attributes and here you have A4 okay and let's assume you have AVG of some attribute now this is not allowed okay this is not allowed is this clear this is not allowed please tell me did you understand let me know is this clear also what is not allowed let me tell you also what is not allowed for example for example here you have A1 A2 A3 and let's assume here you only have A1 A2 okay here you have A1 A2 A3 and let's assume you have like this okay this and let's assume count count based on A4 that is fine aggregation is fine okay aggregation is fine but remember here you have A1 A2 A3 here you don't have maybe let's assume CC CC now can I say this is allowed can I say this is allowed no no no no these must be as it is unaggregated unaggregated okay so remember this is also not allowed because here you have A1 A2 A3 here you have A1 A2 so this is also not allowed actually this is not allowed in sql92 which we will follow for the gate exam this is not allowed in SQL 92 standard okay in sql92 standard this is not allowed in other standard this is allowed in SQL 99 this is allowed okay is this clear but from the gate exam point of view always follow sql92 because all the standard books they are based on sql92 all the standard books ulman rurak Krishna nawate K all of them they are based on sql92 in SQL 99 this is allowed okay but this is not allowed in sql92 from the gate exam point of view stick to sql92 because all the standard books they are based on sql92 so if you stick to sql92 your answer will not be wrong okay yes or no so very simple now let me tell you so is this clear that you cannot put extra attribute in select Clause you cannot put extra unaggregated attribute extra unaggregated attribute you cannot put this is not allowed in any SQL actually this is not allowed in any in any SQL standard okay and one more thing if you have A1 A2 A3 here but here you are putting A1 A2 you are not putting A3 directly you are not putting A3 directly this is not allowed in sql92 so what is the conclusion then you don't have to you don't have to think too much okay just follow this this follow okay this is this template you follow is this clear that if you have A1 A2 A3 here then A1 A2 A3 here and aggregation you can do on anything you can do aggregation on anything so this is the template you can follow is this clear you can see this is from the standard resource this template is given from this University Group by B1 BK so this B1 BK must be here okay aggregation you can do on anything it doesn't matter is this clear let me know so very simple this B1 BK is here this B1 BK is here okay aggregation you can do on any attribute aggregation you can do on any attribute now what the what this means what this as means this is just a renaming this is just renaming okay this is just renaming you are renaming that okay in the output this aggregation you will write as X1 okay so the output will look like this your output will look like this in the output you will have B1 B2 BK okay this aggregation this aggregation is renamed as X1 okay and so on this aggregation is renamed as XM M so this will be your output so remember this is just renaming is this clear anyone has any doubt let me know please tell me so is this clear let me know I'm giving you the conclusion remember I giving you again the conclusion I will give you don't worry so far you understand I know again I will tell you the conclusion but let me tell you the conceptual evaluation when you have group by then what is the conceptual evaluation so remember this is the syntax this is the syntax first you will write select then from then where then Group by this is the syntax in in this order you will write this is a syntax okay this is the syntax now what the semantic what the conceptual evaluation this is a conceptual evaluation right is this the actual evaluation tell me is this actual evaluation no this is just a conceptual EV valuation for our understanding the evaluation the dbms will not execute like this I told you in the last lecture that this is just a conceptual evaluation dbms will not execute like this this is just for our understanding so remember first you do from then you do where okay first you do the cross product of these tables the from these tables you do the cross product then you filter the tles okay okay based on the tle selection condition then you make the group after making group you output the select okay is this clear so first then second then third and select is fourth I hope this point is clear so this is the conceptual evaluation I hope you understood one more thing the aggregation will always happen within the groups okay see you already have this template right the template is like this that the group by if I'm grouping by let's assume a comma B okay I'm grouping by this then in the select this a comma B must come as it is right unaggregated this a comma B must come as it is okay you have from something something something where something something something okay so now remember this a comma B must be coming as it is this aggregation you can do for anything for example you can do sum of a you can do minan of C okay you can do count star so aggregation you can do on anything one thing I want to tell you this aggregation will happen Group by group wise okay this aggregation this aggregation will happen group wise happens group wise okay is this clear so if there is no having CL close if there is no having close then for every group one tle will be there okay is this clear so remember aggregation will happen group wise group wise for every group aggregation will happen this is the one point and when there is no having close then number of tles in the output that will be what so let me write it here this is a note when there is no having Clause then what will be the answer when no having Clause then then for every group one tle in output for every group one tle in output okay for every group one tle in output also so I can say so number of tles in output that will be what so number of tles in output that will be equal to number of groups number of groups but here one thing you have to take care before creating the group will you apply the tle selection condition will you apply the we or not before creating groups will you apply the where close or not yes of course first you will apply we Clause then grouping will happen Okay so this actually I've seen some students making mistake see this is a very good result actually let me tell you one thing there are two gate question in which big query is given there is a question in Gate 2019 another question I think gate 2021 okay you can check it there are two gate question in which actually these are Big questions both the questions are very big some details are given then query is given okay then query is given and the question is asking number of tles the question is asking number of tles in output okay is this clear so here you have group by okay in the query there is group by and there is no having there is group by and there is no having okay actually in this situation what you need to do first you apply the we Clause first of course you have to apply the we Clause first you apply this wear Clause then find how many groups are there find how many groups are there then you don't have to do anything you don't have to see the select you do not have to do anything the answer will be number of groups But first you apply the wear Clause I told you in the conceptual evalution first we filter the tles then we find the number of groups there are two G questions you can check it out okay and those two G questions you can very easily solve this is the result number of tles in the output is equal to number of groups when there is no having Clause okay so when there is having Clos then for every group one tle in the output so I can say number of tles in the output that is equal to number of groups and there is a note here okay before creating groups apply we Clause yes or no that you already know that before creating groups first we have to apply we Clause before creating groups apply where clause don't forget about wear Clause okay so that's it very simple so this result actually will help you okay so now let's see this this table R is given to you if I do group by a how many groups will be created please tell me forget about this forget about this if I do group by a then how many groups will be created Group by a see Group by a so value of this is one this is one this is one so they will be in one group yes or no you can assume that they are in group one value two value two they are in group two value three in group this will come in group three yes or no so there will be three three groups created agree okay so you can see three groups are created okay Group by a so three groups are created this group this group this group yes or no okay now now if I select a count star Max B then what will be the answer see I have done the grouping by a now I'm selecting a comma count star comma Max B for every group one tle will come for this group tle will come a value is one for this group look at the first group only for every group for every group one tle will come for this group a value is one a value is one count is star that is three for this group aggregation will happen groupwise for every group aggregation will happen so for this group count star is three and the max value is a c what is the max value among a comma B comma C tell me what is maximum in a comma B comma c lexicographic order okay a is less than b is less than C lexico graphic order so maximum is C very simple so you can apply the lexor graphic order so that's it very easily you can see that for every group one tle will be created is this clear next what about this one what about this for this group one tle will be created see a value is two a value is two count star is two and maximum value is B what about this next one for this group for this group value is three a value a value a a value is three okay count star is one and maximum value is a so did you notice that there is no having here we do not have any having Clause so the number of tles in the output that is equal to number of groups agree is this clear please tell me very simple right I hope you understood so you can easily see output will have one tle per group okay for every group one tle simple now let's move on now tell me the answer for this question how many tles in the output we are do we are doing grouping by a comma B how many groups will be created see first you will do this from R this is your table R this is the table R okay from R then then you will do this grouping by a comma B so you can see a A1 B1 A1 B1 so they will be in one group see they will be this will be in group pink group okay they are in the same group A1 B1 A1 B1 they are in the same group this is also in the pink group yes or no they are in the same group is this clear I doing virtual grouping so you can say that these are I can say these are group number one okay let's call it group number one A2 B1 A2 B1 this A2 B1 this is group number two A2 B1 so these two tles in group number two okay let me use some different color so for example you can see this tle also this tle A2 B1 A2 B1 they are in the group number two okay and what is group number three you can see this is group number three understood group number three tell me is there any first group second group third group is there any concept of first group second group third group is there any concept no this is just this is just virtual grouping we are doing for our convenience I want to solve the question without any mistake so I'm doing this okay there is no concept of first group second group third group there is no such concept I told you this is just virtual grouping okay now you tell me we have done the grouping now select a comma B you can see select a comma B so remember the aggregation will happen group wise okay so the output will be like this let me tell you the output the output will have total four columns one column A another column B another column su su C and another column Max D so these will be the columns okay now you tell me so for each group one tle will come because there is no having yes or no there is no having Clause so at this point okay just one thing I want to tell you once you have found the groups now do you even care about this statement see there is no having Clause Please look at this there is no having Clause okay there is no having Clause first you do this then there is no where you don't have to filter the tles then you create groups you got three groups you got three groups now do you care about this first statement does it matter this first statement does it matter do you worry about first statement do you worry no forget about it the answer will be three tles three groups three tles when there is no having Clause then number of tles in the output will be number of groups so because there are three groups so the answer will have three tles that's it you don't have to write you don't have to write the output is this clear you don't you do not have to write the output you can simply say if the question is asking number of tles in output that will be same as number of groups the answer will be three you don't have to worry about the first line but anyway let me tell you what will be the first line okay just for just for understanding purpose let me tell you so for every group one tle will come what is the tle for G1 group for G1 group what the tle will come tell me for G1 group for G1 group a value is A1 B1 a value they are A1 B1 the summation C that will be 1 + 2 + 6 that will be 9 maximum D that will be 12 this tle will come next tell me about the next that is for G2 for G2 what will happen you can see G2 has A2 B1 value of a comma B that is A2 B1 next sum of C that will be8 5 5A 3 that is 8 and Max of D that will be 11 finally you tell me about this last group that is G3 okay so the value is A3 B2 the sum of C that is four and the maximum that is 10 okay Max of D that is 10 so you can see the aggregation is happening group wise for every group aggregation is happening so this is your final output output has three tles okay yes or no this is the final output so number of tles in output there is no having Clause so the number of tles in the output that will be number of groups that is three okay for every group one tle is this clear Group by close is the most easy concept yes or no do you agree with me it it is very it is very intuitive right Group by this is very intuitive you are creating groups you are creating virtual groups very simple this is a very simple concept let me tell you some more questions let me take number of tles in the output now I will take the null values as well okay I want to tell all the variations so let me take I'm I'm I'm giving you a table in this table let's assume you have these attributes a b c three attributes okay some values I'm giving for example let's assume 2 3 null 2 3 null let's assume null null null I want to take all the variations so I'm doing this of course 2 3 4 2 4 3 3 42 3 42 or maybe 3 41 so like this okay some type of variations I want to take so let me give you this table okay let's see what variations we can create on this table so first of all let me do grouping by you just tell me what question you want to answer like what just tell me which for which question you want the answer for which question for example if you do grouping by a okay from this table R let me put the where condition also the where condition is that where B value is not equal to three is not equal to three okay B value is not equal to three select in the select I have to put a right yes or no in the select I have have to put a that you already know in the select we have to put a can I put B can I put B no that is invalid I cannot put B okay but I can put aggregate yes or no I can put for example sum of B I can put sum of B I can put count of B these things I can put okay or maybe count of C I can put that or maybe count of a I can put that that you already know I can put count of a okay now you tell me the answer so this is your first question number of tles in the output so first what you will do first this is the table okay this is the first step the second step is this this is the second step remember First Step was this and this is the second step B is not equal to 3 B is not equal to three so tell me which which tle will satisfy B is not equal to Three B is not equal to 3 this is not equal to this is not equal and this is comparison this is comparison so tell me for this tle this condition will be true or false here this will be false here this will be false here unknown here false here true here true here true so only these three tles will pass yes or no only these three tles will pass all these remaining tles are already failed they are already failed yes or no is this clear now you are doing grouping by a this is your next step now you are doing grouping by a how many groups two groups one group is this another group is this you are doing grouping by a so now two groups are created okay is this clear one grouping is this another grouping is this and finally now you don't have to look at the first line what will be the answer how many tles will be there in the output you don't have to worry about the first statement number of groups two groups are there so output will have two Tes but anyway tell me what are those two Tes for sake of completion what are those two Tes for sake of completion the final output will be okay these are the attributes a the final output is something like this that you have a there is sum of B and there is count of a you can see so there will be two tles in the output so a value a value 2 a value 3 okay these are the output tles a value 2 a value 3 you can see sum of B that is 48 and count of a that is 1 2 is this clear 2 4 1 382 these are the two tles is this clear so the number of tles in the output that will be two did you notice what is the tricky part here tell me in this question what do you think is the most tricky part where students can make mistakes what is that that is we condition this where condition yes or no okay because this this tle will will fail this tle is going to fail okay I hope this point is clear now just let me quickly ask you if I do grouping by B let me do grouping by maybe grouping by c i doing grouping by C and the condition I'm putting that is C is less than three Okay C is less than three or C is greater than equal to 3 this is the condition I'm putting Okay C is less than 3 or C is greater than equal to 3 okay is this clear from R select I have to put C here I have to put C here okay and let me write for example count star now you tell me the answer what is going to to be the answer number of tles that will be so first of all this condition who will satisfy first you will do the from Clause then you will do the where Clause this condition will be satisfied by whom by non null tles where C is non null yes or no where C is n null so these tles will pass these four tles they will pass okay yes or no and these tles they will fail now you tell me Group by C we are grouping by C so how many groups will be created this is the third thing how many groups are going to be created so you can see 1 2 3 4 four groups will be created okay the answer will be what answer will be four okay if you want the actual answer the output is like this the final output that will have four there are two columns one is count one another is Count star one is C another is Count star okay so the answer will be so the value of C you can see 4 3 2 1 and count star is 11 1 is this clear so 41 31 2 1 1 1 this is the answer I hope this point is clear and I hope you are getting that any variation you can handle is this clear for example let me create groups based on based on a comma C let me create groups based on a comma C okay and where condition let's assume I'm not putting any where condition there is no where condition now okay select should I put a comma C here yes of course a comma C I should put here can I put B here I cannot put B here okay but I can put for example I can put average of B that I can do okay no one is stopping me I can do average of B I can do average of C aggregation I can do on anyone okay now tell me the answer for this question quickly so how many groups will be created how many groups so you can see two null two null they are one group okay so one group is this see this is your group number one I can call it group number one another group is this let's call it group number two next 2 42 3 32 3 1 so there are different different groups this is group number three group four group 5 and group six okay so let me write it group three group four group five group six correct so the answer will be what the number of tles will be same as number of groups number of tles that is going to be same as number of okay so very simple there will be total six groups you just tell me about the group number one what will be the output in the output just tell me about the group number one in the output you have a c avgb yes or no you have a c a a g b what about the group number one for the group number one one tle you will get one tle so AC value is 2 three AC value is 23 and AVG of actually the interesting part will be AVG of C right okay the interesting question will be AVG of C the interesting question that will be AVG of C that will be interesting question so tell me AVG of C for this group AVG of C so remember this AVG this will ignore the null values now you have empty now you have empty table for empty table AVG that will be null okay so AVG of C that will be null clear so 2 three null what about Group B for Group B what will happen that will be null null null null null okay like this group group C group group three and so on okay so total six groups will be there very simple now let's move on I hope you understood all these points clear any variation can you handle what are the tricky part what is the tricky part where before creating the group please apply the we Clause don't forget about we Clause that is very important okay because you can make mistake in the wear Clause that is the possibility okay now let's move on tell me the answer for this question quickly this is question from thean book how many tles in the output a student is saying sir there is a mistake in G1 it will be null in C field in G1 okay okay okay okay AC that is null right right right okay this mistake we made because AC see the AC value is 2 null okay yes or no in the group one the AC value is 2 null two null so that will be two null and average of C will be null there is no other mistake right so thank you for pointing out gorov thank you now let's move on so tell me the answer for this question this is manman question quickly tell me the answer the result of this group by a a comma count of B so here you can easily see you will do group by a so one group will be created one group will be created the value of a is unknown uh sorry value of a is null and count of B what that will be count of B that will be zero so the answer will be null comma 0 yes or no very simple because remember this a value one group will be created this one group will be created in this group a value is null and count B this count will ignore the null value it will ignore null value for empty table count is zero for empty table count is zero so your answer will be null comma 0 this is your answer okay is this clear so very simple the answer is null comma 0 you can easily see now in the same question if I ask you what is sum of B maybe multiple things I can ask but for now you just tell me what is sum of B what is sum of B what is Count star tell me these things okay what is Count star or what is also let me ask what is count of a what is mean of B so tell me all the answers this is my question you tell me the answer very simple one group will be created this is the group that will be created okay so you can see there will be one group now in this group the output the output will have these columns The Columns will be like this a sum of B count star count count a and minan of B okay so one group is there so one tle will be there right yes or no there will be only one tle one tle in the output so you can see that in this group the value of a that is already null there is no problem now this sum this sum of B this sum of B this sum will ignore the null value for empty table sum will be null okay so SU will be null count star this will always count the number of tles within the group number of tles within the group so number of tles within the group that is one yes or no number of tles within the group this count a this will ignore the null value for mty table count is equal to zero minan B this will ignore the null value sorry this is Count a count a will ignore this null value count a will ignore the null value of a for empty table count is equal to zero next for minan b minan b will ignore the null value of B and for the empty table minan is equal to null so your answer is null null 1 Z null this is your answer is this clear you can read this explanation here when you have sum B the answer will be null null if you have some B tell me the answer for this question quickly this question I've taken from is take overflow R AB is a relation with single tle null null you have a relation with single tle null null so there is a single tle in this r that is a b and that is null null so tell me the answer here what will be the answer okay very simple for this query the answer will be there will be count of B so the answer is going to you can see the value of a we are grouping by the value of a value of a is null and count of B this count will ignore the null value of B for empty table count is equal to zero so that will be null comma 0 okay for this question the answer will be a count star for this question answer will be null comma 1 okay and for this question answer will be what that will be a comma sum of B so that will be null comma null okay so the answer will be you can see null0 null one null null okay so that's it I hope you understood all these points this you can see tell me in this query do we have having Clause Is there any having Clause here select there is Select there is from there is Group by okay there is no having Clause so what will be the number of tles in the output how many tles will be there in the output that will be number of groups yes or no now first you will apply from from user table this is the user table on your screen this is the user table now in this user table so let me write it this is your user table in this user table from user this is your step number one now then you will create the group based on ages based on age you will create group how many groups will be there two groups will be there yes or no in one group these two will be will be there in another group these two will be there so you can see one group another group based on ages okay based on age now you can see we are selecting age average popularity okay so you can see for every group one tle will come in the output for this group one tle in the output okay similarly for this group one tle in the output for every group one tle in the output yes or no so like this you can easily see so I hope you have become expert of group by Clause tell me are you comfort comfortable with Group by Clause okay one very important thing I want to tell you that is Group by without aggregation is valid but useless did you notice one thing when I started telling teaching you Group by from the beginning I telling you that group by application is with summary group-wise summary we want Group by because we want groupwise summary for every group we want aggregation did you notice that so can we apply Group by without aggregation can we do that let me know can we apply Group by without aggregation yes we can apply we can do that but it will be useless okay actually Group by without aggregation this is same as select distinct this is same as select distinct let me give you one example okay with example this point will become very clear so let's assume you have group by okay Group by some attribute a and in the select I do not put any aggregation I okay I have to put a right yes or no I have to put this a here can I put B here I cannot do that okay so I have to put a here okay let's assume from from some from table R okay let me also give you where let me also give you where where a is equal to 3 okay and you already know know that group group by a so very simple now you can see there is no aggregation now you take the table I am giving you this table R where you have AB two attributes you have okay let me take some variations for example maybe I can take 2 1 2 3 okay 2 null null 2 null null okay some variations I'm taking and maybe 3 3 1 3 n okay so let's assume some more tles let me take so that I can cover all the variations for example let me take three three okay and null comma 3 okay so let let me take this now tell me what will be the answer one more tle let me take one more tle just one more that is null null okay now you tell me what will be the answer so you can easily see First Step will be from R this is your first step the Second Step will be a equal to 3 so which tles will be gone because of a equal to 3 so you can see a equal to 3 so a equal to 3 or maybe I can say not equal okay else let me let me put not equal not equal to 3 okay let me put not equal to 3 a is not equal to 3 so tell me if I put not equal to three then which Tes are gone so you can see these Tes are gone these are failed yes or no these tles failed sorry uh all all these last the all of these actually failed all of them actually failed okay so now now you are creating group based on a so only this group will be created okay so that's it one group will be created and then what you are doing you are selecting a so your output will be what you are selecting a for every group one tle yes or no for every group one tle is this clear for every group one tle now did you notice that the same output you will get okay one very interesting thing I'm I'm telling you I'm going to tell you that is the same output you will get if you put forget about see there is no aggregation right there is no aggregation so the same output you will get if you just put select distinct okay see this is a interesting point that the same output you will get if you put select distinct select distinct okay just ignore the just remove the group by you don't need Group by there is no need of group by because Group by is useless when there is no aggregation see there is no aggregation right because there is no aggregation Group by is useless this group by is same as select distinct okay just notice for this query what will be the output tell me for this query what will be the output you will see that for this query also the same output you will get agree for this query also the same output you will get the output will be a value two is this clear and for this also the output will be a value two is this clear so very simple point right okay understood let me know did you understand one more one more example let me take one more example let me remove this we condition now you tell me the output again they will give you the same output but tell me the output what will be the output again they are going to give you the same output okay so Group by okay so now tell me one thing you notice is there aggregation here in this group by in this group by is there any aggregation there is no aggregation so Group by is useless okay Group by is useless you can just simply put select distinct you can remove Group by and you can put select distinct let me tell you they will give you the same output you can check it okay for example here Group by a how many groups will be created how many groups will be created the output will be a the output will be a how many groups will be created so one group group will be created for AAL to 2 another group for a equal to null another group for a equal to 3 yes or no so these are the groups that will be created this will be the output you tell me the output of this select distinct a select distinct a do you remember the definition of distinct tles do you remember that definition of distinct tles that will be useful here definition of duplicate tles okay do you remember that duplicate tles so for example if you remember I told you that these tles for example null two null two they are duplicate right they are duplicate okay if you remember I told you null null null null they are duplicate we have already seen the definition of duplicate apples that will help you here so now you tell me from R select distinct a distinct a so the answer will be two null three did you notice same output you are getting please tell me this is the interesting point right that group by without aggregation is same as select distinct Group by without aggregation is useless that is same as select distinct okay is this clear please tell me did you find this point interesting this is given in the man book this interesting point is given in this man book you can see you can see this is Group by there is no aggregation right there is no aggregation okay so Group by without aggregation this is same as select distinct it will be same as select distinct is this clear so very simple point so this is what we can see if we apply Group by without aggregation then it will be useless and it will be same as select distinct so this important point I can say this interesting point I wanted to tell you I hope you understood this I've given you the example also okay for example this example you can see this query Group by we are using without aggregation so this is same as select distinct they will give you the same same result okay let's move on now so that's it we have seen the group by close and the SQL query template will be this is the query template these Group by attributes you have to put in the select Clause that that I already told you okay so tell me where is the error what is not allowed in SQL for example if I do this select if I put like select a comma B okay prom and group by in the group by I have a so means here I have a comma B and in the group by I have a so is this allowed or not okay let's assume there is Count also no problem there's C star also so now you tell me this is not allowed in SQL in any version of SQL this is not allowed in any version of SQL correct okay not allowed in any version of SQL in any SQL version this is not allowed in any SQL version okay see a student is saying that but it will run but it will run if you run this it will run one thing I want to tell you see uh let me tell you from the C language point of view for the gate exam you study C language right okay now let me tell you if you create the concept by running the program if you create your own concept then that is wrong because in the C language many many things are undefined see I've seen many students what they do for example they will do some experiment in the C language they will do this type of experiment print F okay print F some experiment they will do plus plus a plus plus a okay have you done this type of experiment plus plus a plus plus okay some some this type of experiment have you done maybe so in the C language this you will see many times that students what they do they will run this and after running after running some multiple experiments they will run and then they will create their own Concepts in the mind they will be thinking that I have created the concept okay by running the program they will run this program then they will do some more experiment then they will do some more experiment okay they will do this type of experiment plus plus b plus plus plus plus b okay some type of experiment they will do okay and then they will think they will think that I've created the Concepts okay I have I have become the Dennis Richie yes or no the inventor of C language the rules of C language are created by me so let me tell you when you run the C language program when you run the C program and then you create your own Concepts then those are wrong concepts are Concepts see whatever program you write whatever for example this is undefined in C language C language does not say anything about this this let me tell you C language does not say anything about this okay so but if you run this on some compiler definitely some output you will get if you run this on 10 different compilers you will you may get 10 different outputs okay because these things are undefined in C C does not mention anything about these what will happen that depends on the compiler okay different compilers can give you different output is this clear so remember to study any language C language if you want to study if you want to study the rules of C language then don't run the program and check the output first you learn the concept then run the program okay some student they do opposite first they run the program then they create Concepts is this clear so the correct method is first you learn the con concept okay you study the correct concept first you understand it then you run the program don't go in the other way now here you can see I told you that this is invalid this is not allowed in in any version of C in any version of SQL this in select in select you are putting B but here you are not putting B this is not allowed in any version of SQL okay but if you run this on some SQL processor okay on some SQL compiler if you run this definitely some output you will get definitely it is possible that you will get some output okay some SQL compiler will say it is invalid some other SQL compiler will give you some output and then you will be thinking I understood the concept now I have become the uh what was that God of destruction okay so you know so that dialogue you will you will mention so again uh so first you learn correct concept then you run the program okay to create the concept don't run the program is this clear I hope you understood okay so anyway so remember this is not allowed in any version of SQL what about this if I put if I put AB here but I don't put B here now tell me if I put AB here but I don't put B here now what I can put count B remember aggregation I can put on anything it doesn't matter I can put aggregation on anything but I'm putting AB here I'm not I'm only putting a here then this is not allowed in in SQL 92 in SQL 92 this is not allowed it is allowed in SQL 99 it is actually allowed in other SQL versions SQL SQL latest versions okay but from the gate exam point of view we stick to SQL 92 this is for gate for gate exam point of view you just stick to sql92 is this clear let's move on now so this is what I'm telling you read this please read this this is must rule for group by clause okay so every unaggregated attribute of Select Clause must appear in group by Clause yes or no this will happen in every version of SQL in every version of SQL every unaggregated attribute of Select must appear in the group by okay now aggregated attribute can be anyone okay you can do aggregation on any attribute any attribute you can aggregate okay now sql92 rule let's see SQL two rule that is the group by attributes must be in the select Clause all Group by attributes must appear in the select Clause unaggregated all Group by attributes must appear in select Clause unaggregated okay so this is sql92 I hope this point is clear you can see you can read this sql92 standard okay these two rules you can read anyway we have already seen this is a meme I created when you put some attribute in group by Clause but not in select Clause then sql92 man okay you can read this meme next for the gate exam we will follow sql92 is this clear so look at this here you can see Group by a we are putting a here unaggregated aggregation you can do on anyone it doesn't matter okay so this is a correct query is this clear what this query is doing look at this query this is grouping by a so for every a there there will be a group and for every group you are finding average popularity for every group average popularity you are finding okay very simple now let's move on so we have seen number of groups is equal to number of rows in the final output this will happen when which things you have to take care this will happen first of all when no having Clause when no having clause okay and the second after we Clause these things you should take care after where is this clear so number of groups will be equal to number of rows in the final output let's move on now if there is no Group by then what do you think every tle will be a group or the entire table will be a group think about it logically logically think about it if there is no Group by if there is no Group by then the entire table will be single group or every tle will be a group what do you think let me know if there is no Group by if there is no Group by see just think logically if there is no Group by okay let me let me tell you consider this query I'm giving you a query select select AVG or maybe sum of a from R is there any Group by here is there any Group by here just tell me there is no Group by right okay there is no Group by so now you tell me how many tles will be there in the output this will give you how many tles in the output PR R sum of a how many tles you will get in the output you will get only one tle in output right you will get one now you think about it if every tle is a group then will you get one tle if every tle is a group will you get one tle no no the entire table is a group then you will get one tle right yes or no is this clear logically you think logically if there is no Group by then you will get one tle in the output you can see for this query you will get one tle in the output because the entire table is a group so remember if there is no Group by Clause if the group by Clause is removed then the entire table is single group entire table is a single group okay is this clear so you can see one tle if you if you put aggregate then one tle in the output also one more thing can I put some other attribute like sum of a can I put unaggregated attribute here from R can I do this in the last lecture we have seen this is invalid this is invalid if you remember if you have aggregation it's like this see if there is aggregation then this attribute must come from the group by yes or no do you agree if there is aggregation this is aggregation is fine this aggregated attribute this is fine but in the select Clause you have this so this must come from group by there is no Group by so this should not come there is no Group by okay so anyway this is invalid so very simple Point don't think too much okay so just if there is no Group by close then entire table is regarded as a single group that's it that's it okay so for this query one tle in the output and this query is invalid I told you in the last lecture when you have aggregation then you cannot put unaggregated attribute this we have seen in the last lecture okay so very simple you can see here you will get one tle in the output okay from the user table average popularity so you can see this entire table will be created will be considered as a group there is no Group by there is no Group by so all the T the entire table is one group and for one group one one tle will be in the output okay so the output will be average popularity that's it so we have seen all these points is this query valid is this query valid Group by a can you put uid unaggregated see Group by a can you put uid unaggregated no so this is invalid query you can see wrong what about this what about this there is no Group by we have no Group by if there is aggregation can you put an an aggregated attribute there is aggregation can you put unaggregated attribute the answer is no so again this is wrong in the last lecture we have seen this if there is no Group by and you are putting aggregation then you cannot put unaggregated attribute okay now we will study having Clause we have already seen Group by Clause all the variations all the rules everything we have seen now we will study having clause and this we will study in the next part in the next part we are going to study having clause also we will study nested queries okay that is what is remaining having Clause order there is order by Clause Okay so these two Clause we have to study let me tell you the remaining things having Clause is remaining order by Clause is remaining and nested queries is remaining that's it okay everything else we have seen so please tell me did you like this session let me know so this was SQL complete summary part two the part one link you can find in the description and let me know in the comments whether you likeed this session or not okay so thank you everyone remember I have I have told you each and every concept every important point every variation okay e every type of example so everything we have covered in this SQL complete summary and if you watch only this SQL complete summary if you watch part one part two and the part three if you watch all the part all the three parts then you will be able to solve each and every gate question each and every gate question you will be able to solve and also in the future if any gate question comes from the SQL you will be able to solve okay thank you everyone thank you everyone please comment please like and comment okay thank you

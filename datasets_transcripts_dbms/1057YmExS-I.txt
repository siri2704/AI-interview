and this course mainly deals with you know these few things I will not understand this course you have to understand clearly about the meaning of these things first one is data so what is data is we have various kinds of definitions but then you know coming to this course ah what I mean by data is it could be any fact that can be recorded and stored right so data is any fact that can be recorded if you can record it that's just a data okay according to this course and if you want to see any examples about data you may think of data as some text right your you know your facts can be written in terms of some text like names name is a fact isn't it or some numbers like your address phone number and all or it can be even some images right images means the pictures that we take right that could also be a data or it can be videos like you know right now you're watching right videos or there are various 10 right speech so these are all data if they can be recorded then it is data and then from this we are going to Define database so a database is collection of related data which means if you if you take a collection of text or if you take a collection of numbers or if you take collection of images or if you take collection of videos they are all called as you know database so database you know according to this definition of this course see whatever terms these are they have various definitions you can find them in internet but coming to this course these are defined this way ok so database means it is actually a collection of all these related data right so it is collection collection of related data ok now uh you can you can you know traditionally the databases have been applied only for the data which are either text or you know numbers for example if you want to store something about a student right then you are going to store the name which is text and maybe he says and maybe his marks and maybe his address right and all these are going to be ah you know text and numbers or maybe if you if you want to resolve some ticket right online then how is that you are going to do it again the text and numbers are going to be used traditionally it has been numbers and you know text so there are various types of databases now one type of database will contain only text and numbers and it is also called as traditional database okay and and recently we know with the with videos being uploaded and downloaded at a very frequent Pace there has been a database created which is a database of you know videos or or they might even content database of speech or they might contain database of songs or movies anything like that and that is called as multimedia database right multimedia will be present in that and you know ah recently you have seen this there has been lot of you know there have been lot of these satellites and the satellites are going to take the images of Earth and they are going to send you back or even we have we have sent many rockets and which are going to take the space space videos right so they are all called as you know geographic information systems which will contain mainly images right so depending on what we are trying to do there are various types of and there are even you know real-time databases so real-time databases means you know these These are generally used in the production right or if if you have a store if you have a supermarket and now you know you are selling some Goods you want to keep track of how many how many items are remaining of each type so that you want to place a model if their type stock is over right they're all called as real time so there are various types of databases and you know sometimes we have other than databases you know if they database size is going to be very huge then it is called as data warehouse so data warehouse is also a kind of database um so what is the main difference between the database and data warehouses data warehouse is also a kind of database in which the data is going to be very huge and historical which means we are going to have a data stored about a company for the past 100 years and then we will want to see it or we want to store let us say the share the stock market the stock stock market rates and all and we want to predict the future by looking at the past for the past 100 years if you are looking at that huge data 100 years data right there is going to be historical data and is going to be very close in that case the database is also called as data warehouse right so these are the various examples of databases sorry following it data is just a fact which can be recorded and these are all the examples of data and database means it is a collection of data which is related right for example you know YouTube is having this multimedia database right or Vimeo is having multimedia database right and NASA is having GIS right geographic information system database so which means they are going to have the data which is related to various things but then once you decide upon some database you have to put only the things which are related to the database right so every insertion and deletion will be only the only concerning the data which is related to what you have defined okay and then ah once you have come up with the database you are going to store it on a computer mainly see earlier databases were managed manually then what is the database a book you can take it as database then how do we do manipulate it using a pen right because it is it was managed manually right and later now we are going to computerize everything so every database is currently present on the computer now whenever you have a computer and data present on this there should be some programs which should be defined isn't it you have to Define some programs right and those programs should typically be um able to do this so like it has to Define which means you have to define the data types these structures and data types integer characters shrink like that okay you have to define the data which are which you are going to place in that and then maybe you have to construct construct the database using the software right so constructing means how are you going to place the data on the hard disk or the storage device and then manipulate so manipulating means you know that adding and deleting data from the database so whenever you have this database now you need this software which should be able to define the database construct it and may be manipulated right so for this reason we have to write some programs and you know earlier operating system is to provide some some sort of you know provision to do all this but what happened is putting this burden on the operating system is going to be very very you know ah constraint and in the sense we do not want the operating system to be very huge right because Boot time is going to be very high so we don't want to put this burden on the operating system as well operating system is already managing many things right and moreover if you give this responsibility operating system the problem is whenever you want to go to your database you are supposed to call the operating system and operating system whenever it is called it will it will switch the switch from user mode to Kernel mode which is very secure right and in most of the cases we do not need that much functionality we want the fastness right therefore users whoever are defining the database they just want to access the database very fast they don't want many services which are you know given the operating system in that case a user will write his own programs which will be able to access his own database and everything will be running in the user mode right and this set of programs which will be doing all these things on the database which is defined is called as database management system so dbms is set of programs right it is actually a set of programs which are used to Define construct and manipulate the database that is what you can understand by dbms the term dbms so dbms is just software databases the data collection of data and data is any fact okay and what are the various types of dbms you have so you there are various companies which are providing different types of databases we shall see all of them okay one by one when we go into the topic right and then ah once you take this database defined and the collection of programs which are going to act on that database see it is not that you have one particular database system which can access any data depending on the type of data the database system the database management system also has to vary right therefore the collection of database and the database management system these two are generally combined called as database systems DBS right so database is the collection of data and it is set of programs so the data plus the programs which are used to you know manipulate this data is collectively called as database systems so if you want to understand it you can take think of it this way database you can think of it as a book one book and database management system you can think of it as a pen right in the real you know without computers right so coming to computers these are nothing but the data which is stored on the computers and these are the set of programs which are used to manipulate it and combine it they are called as database systems right okay

[Music] okay now let us see some examples for ER model so consider a company has several departments one employee will manage the department and we keep a track of the start date of the department manager our department may have several locations each department controls a number of projects so there are several projects each project has a unique name a unique number and it is located at a single location now employee and the details of the employees are stored and employee works for one department but they may work on several projects we keep track of the number of hours per week that an employee currently works on each project we also keep track of the direct supervisor of each employee and the employee also has some dependents for the dependence we keep track of the name sex birth date and relationship so let us first understand the cardinality ratio between employee and Department there are two relations one is works on and the other one is managers now managers is a one-to-one uh relationship but not all employees are managers but definitely every department has a manager so employees participation is partial but Department participation is total start date is also a attribute of is an attribute of relationship the next is works for relationship again between employee and department but this is many to one every employee every uh that and because many employees work for one relationship and the participations are total here because uh that that is at the department will have at least one employee and every employee will belong to at least one Department the next is Department controls project now one Department might uh one Department might control several projects now project will definitely belong to a department but sometimes Department may not have a project under it so project participation is total broad Department participation is partial the next is supervision now supervision that is one employee might supervise several employees it's a relationship between employee and employee it's a recursive relationship and it is one to many and it is partial on both the sides that is uh sometimes or not all the employees are supervisors and sometimes an employee may not have a supervisor the next is works on relationship works on relationship is between employee and project one employee can work on many projects and one project will have many employees so it is many to many relationship the attribute is number of hours and one employee has to work on some of the other projects so from employee side it is total participation and any project will have at least one employee so on the other side also it is total participation the next is has dependence relationship it's a relationship between employee which is a strong entity and dependent which is a weak entity now uh weak entity always has a total participation but the employee need not have any dependent may not have any dependent so employee will be partial so this is how the department uh entity will look like foreign entity this will be the employee entity the dependent entity now let us see the complete ER diagram employee a recursive relationship with the Department it is uh here one comma one and here one comma n here 0 comma 1 and 1 comma 1 that is two relationship Works foreign managers so instead of just writing 1 and N we have written here like structural constraints Min and the max the Min and the max values are written here not just the cardinality ratio the Min and the max are written over here as we can see uh manages has an attribute start date department has a derived attribute the number of employees so I can calculate a HR department has two employees finance department has three employees depending upon the list of employees then there is a weak relay there is a weak entity dependent which is given in two consecutive rectangles and it has uh two diamonds that is two consecutive diamonds as a the relationship and this is how they are represented then there is a project Department controls the project the employee works on Project works on has an attribute which is the hours let us take another example so there is a publishing company which produces some books on various subjects and here the books will be written by some authors and the books are edited by others sometimes uh order might work might work with several editors so in this scenario the ER diagram will be so there is a subject and the order will be specializing in some subject this is another way of representing an ER diagram the publication so this these are the entities and the relationship is written over here the publication is the publication as in the book it is edited by some editor it is other writes the book and the author works with some other editor the other editor employs the editor let us take the next example so this basically helps you understand how do I organize various entities depending upon what sentences am I reading now there are there is a hospital which has several words each ward has some patience and uh in any patient is recommended by a general practitioner and in the hospital they are belonging to a consultant other than the consultant there are various doctors also attending the patient so and patient will also have certain tests and treatments tests and its results treatments associated with it doctors will be specialists in some branch of Medicine so award award has several patients and the patience has the test results and the tests the patient also have followed some treatment which are prescribed by a doctor the patient is also assigned and a consultant the patient also under undergoes some diagnosis and that is also prescribed by the doctor the doctor specializes in some specialty and every word will be belonging to some specialty the patient is recommended by a general practitioner so this will be a overall picture of the ER diagram

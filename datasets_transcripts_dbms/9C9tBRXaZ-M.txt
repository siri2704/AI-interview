[Music] foreign and welcome to this video on entity relationship diagram by intellipad The Entity relationship model is a conceptual framework used to describe the structure of a database it provides a clear and visual representation of the relationships between different entities in a system by defining entities as objects with attributes and relationships the ER model allows for efficient organization and understanding of complex data it is widely employed in database design and serves as a foundation for development of efficient and scalable database systems with its Simplicity and flexibility the ER module continues to be a fundamental tool in modern data management in this video we will tell into the entity Relationships by creating tables using MySQL let's get to the agenda points now first we will learn what is an entity then we'll look into its relationships moving on we will see the attributes and different types of attributes further we will learn a pictorial representation of ER diagram now the before getting into the first topic do not forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit the Bell icon for regular updates so now let's start with our first agenda that is what is an entity an entity represents a distinct object concept or thing in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects for example in a university database entities could include student Professor course and Department let's get through our second agenda that is relationships relationships illustrate how entities are associated or connected to each other they describe the interactions or associations between entities relationships can be one to one one-to-many or many too many for example a student entity can be related to a course entity through an enrolled relationship indicating that a student can enroll in multiple courses and a course can have multiple students moving on to our next agenda that is attributes attributes are the properties or characteristics of entities or relationships they provide additional information about the entities or relationships they belong to for instance a student entity may have attributes like student ID name age and gender now moving on to next agenda that is different types of attributes in the entity relationship model there are several types of attributes that can be used to describe entities and relationships these attribute types help Define the characteristics and properties of the entities and relationships within a database here are the commonly used types of attributes in the ER model the first one is simple attribute a simple attribute represents a single indivisible value it is not composed of subparts or further attributes for example an attribute like name or age is considered a simple attribute now moving on to the next type of attribute that is composite attribute a composite attribute is composed of multiple sub attributes it can be further divided into smaller components that have their own meaning and significance for instance an attribute like address can be composed of sub attributes like Street city state and postal code now moving on to our next attribute that is derived attribute a derived attribute is derived or calculated based on other attributes or values within the database it is not directly stored in the database but can be computed or derived from other attributes using a predefined formula or algorithm for example age can be a derived attribute if it is calculated based on the date of birth attribute moving on to the next type of attribute that is multi-valued attribute a multi-valued attribute can have multiple values for a single entity instance it allows an entity to have more than one value for a particular attribute for example an attribute like phone number can have multiple values for a single entity indicating that an entity can have multiple phone numbers now moving to our next type of attribute that is key attribute a key attribute is an attribute that uniquely identifies an entity in stance within an entity set it helps distinguish one entity in stance from another and ensures the uniqueness of each entity for example in a student entity the student ID attribute can serve as a key attribute moving on to the next type of attribute that is null valued attribute a null valued attribute is an attribute that does not have a value or is unknown or not applicable for a particular entity in stance it represents missing or undefined data it is denoted by a special value called null in the database now moving on to the last type of attribute that is composite key a composite key is a combination of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify an entity instance it is used when a single attribute is not sufficient to identify an entity uniquely for example a composite key in a purchase entity can be a combination of order ID and product ID now moving on to our next agenda that is er diagrams the different types of attributes provide flexibility in representing various aspects of entities and relationships within the ER model by utilizing different attribute types the ER model can accurately capture the characteristics and properties of the real world entities and their relationships in a database system ER diagrams are commonly used to visualize the entity relationship model in an ER diagram entities are represented as rectangles relationships as diamonds and attributes as ovals connected to their respective entities so now let's have a demonstrative example by creating two tables and showing the entity relationship between them we have created two tables namely groups and student the group table contains ID as a primary key and name as an attribute similarly the student table contains ID as a primary key name as an attribute wherein we are taking ID as a foreign key from references taking from the ID of the groups after that we are taking the select statements to print the entire table of groups and student as we have not inserted any elements to the group table we can see that the table is empty we can see same for the student table as the table has been created without any elements now coming to the conclusion in the above example we created two tables ER diagrams provide a visual representation of the relationships between entities in a database system helping to illustrate the structure and organization of the data they are widely used in the field of database design to model complex relationships and provide a clear understanding of how different entities are connected ER diagrams use symbols such as rectangles for entities diamonds for relationships and lines to represent the associations and cardinalities between entities by using ER diagrams developers and stakeholders can communicate and collaborate effectively ensuring accurate database design and promoting efficient data management in an organization by using the foreign key constraint and references keyword we establish the relationship between the tables thank you for watching this video for any queries you can contact us through

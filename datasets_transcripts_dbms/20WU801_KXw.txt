in this video we are going to discuss about extended er features in order to handle large amount of data and to use er model in effective manner more features are added to the er model so that's why this is called yes extended er so here er model is extended so totally three features are added they are generalization specialization and aggregation so in this video we are going to discuss about these three concepts first let us see what is generalization generalization is the process of extracting common properties or attributes from a set of entities and create a generalized entity from it so what is generalization generalization means we have to extract common attributes from the entities and we need to create an entity from those entities let us take this example here we have two entities they are student is one entity teacher is another entity the attributes of student entity are rule number name address and mocks whereas the attributes of teacher entity are id name address and salary so what are the common attributes in those two entities the common attributes are name is the common attribute address is the carbon attribute so name is the common attribute address is the common attribute generalization means creating an entity from these two entities okay let us see the next point it is a bottom-up approach so bottom-up approach means always we have to start from the bottom and continues towards the up so here we have to start from the bottom so that means student and teacher and we have to continue towards the up in which two or more entities can be generalized so here we can combine two or more entities so can be generalized to a higher level entity to a higher level entity if they have some attributes in common so when we can create higher level entity if lower level entities have some common attributes so here these two are the lower level entities the common attributes are name and address so now from these two entities we can create higher level entity we can generalize it to a higher level entity so here easy so person is nothing but a student only person is nothing but teacher only okay so here we are creating an entity called person with the common attributes so here what are the common attributes name and address so name and address are nothing but the attributes of the person entity so this is generalization so generalization means if two entities have common attributes then we can create an higher level entity with those common attributes so here a person has only common attributes the common attributes of the lower level entity are name and address so now a person this higher level entity attributes are those common attributes name and address only okay now let us see the second feature that is specialization specialization is entirely opposite to the generalization here an entity is divided into sub entities based on their attributes or properties here it follows a top-down approach so the higher level entity is divided into several lower level entities what is generalization generalization means several lower level entities are combined into higher level entity okay it is a top-down approach where higher level entity is specialized divided into two or more lower level entities so specialization means higher level entity is divided into several lower level entities based on the attributes or properties various generalization means lower level entities are group lower level entities are generalized to high level entity okay so here the higher level entity is a bank account let account has two attributes generally account will have a number of attributes but here we have taken only two attributes they are account number and balance so here ej is nothing but some relation so you account here this higher level entity this higher level entity is splitted this higher level entity is divided into two lower level entities called current account savings account with the same properties so here what are the properties or the attributes of the bank account account number and parents so the lower level entities should also have those two properties so current account has account number balance and savings account also contains same attributes account number and balance so this is about what is specialization so dividing higher level entity into several lower level entities okay so generalization follows bottom up approach where specialization follows top down approach here we have to start from the top and moves towards the down now let us see the third feature that is aggregation aggregation is mainly useful when we have several relationships when we have several relationships then it is very very difficult to use the er model so in in those scenarios we can use the aggregation aggregation concept is included in er model it is useful when we need to express relationships among the relationships so when we have several relationships then we have to use the aggregation uh here previously in generalization as a as well as specialization we use this easier relationship so that is not needed here here we have two entities such as employee project and the relationship is works for employee works for a project in order to do that project let us assume that employee needs some missionary so in order to do that project employee requires some missionary so here requires is requires is one more relationship he requires some missionary so missionary is nothing but an entity so missionary is nothing but an entity so employee works for a project in order to do that project employee requires some missionary so here works for is a relation between these two entities okay various here we have two relationships so that is possible only with the help of the aggregation in normal er model that is not possible in normal er model uh this relationship is used between two entities only okay but here we use as requires between a relation as well as a missionary so that is only possible with the help of this concept so this is about extended er features such as generalization specialization and aggregation

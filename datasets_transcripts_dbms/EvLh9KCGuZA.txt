Hello friends and my dear subscribers welcome to SV technology important question 8. schema refinement or normalization we returned competitive exams please subscriptions it is a technique of organizing data in database database it is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics like insertion update and deletion approach of decomposing tables what is mean by decomposing a network device [Music] schema refinement refers to refine the schema by using some technique the best technique is decomposition schema refinement Define the schema and a schema means design conceptual design schema refined is that is the schema refinement identifying and clearing the future problems in the database is called schema refinement Define 0 to 18 identifying and clearing the future problems in database database flow future problems a future problems in this refinement the main problem is data redundancy It Is awaited by normalization technique so schema references so what is mean by data redundancy data redundancy and DND and the same data different places slow um different Memorial locations low okay data retention so our data redundances [Music] the basic goal of normalization is to eliminate data related so normalization it is the first goal of schema refinement or normalization so normalization normalizationism multi-step process that puts data in tabular form and remove duplicate data from relation table so normalization of various step processing and the first normal form second normal form third normal form evanges to tabular formula designs what is mean by data redundancy so storing the same information repeatedly that is in more than one place within a database is called a data redundancy so okay database redundancy is storing the same information repeatedly in more than one place okay simple so a data redundancy so a data Readiness are three types of problems are three types of problems [Music] anomaly means the problem caused by data redundancy so those anomalies are insertion anomaly deletion anomaly update anomaly okay so mnd problems caused by data redundancy okay data repeated Place insert anomaly delete anomaly update anomaly leather incision and normally deletion anomaly update an insertion anomaly occurs in the relational database when some attributes or data item are inserted into database without existence of other attributes is [Music] it clear next updation anomalies so updation anomaly occurs when the same data item are repeated with the same values or not linked to each other so same data is an inconsistency is created unless copies are similarly updated so suppose over two copies of data only are two copies of data low one copy of data updated copy of data update until same data don't replace load different account D suppose if I take Mahesh is the person having mobile number here one and here another mobile number and the same person mobile number different government this is called Data inconsistency mobile numbers so deletion anomaly and deletion anomalies occurs when deletes one part of the data release the other necessary information from the database so my database deletion is the problem here so like this anomalies are and defined in normal Edition so the data retentions what is data redundancy what are the problems caused by data rate in ncertainty okay

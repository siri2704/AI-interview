everybody can you hear me hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Yes Today we are going to start demo demo class Okay Demo class for Oracle Don't write it These are demo classes Observe it here Oracle 90 C I am writing everyone knows Oracle is a product from Oracle Corporation same like a Java same like a net same like a Python this is a software product from Oracle Corporation 19 is a version number in that software Oracle was released so many versions 1978 year onwards Oracle 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.1 6.0 6.1 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 8.0 8.1.5 8.1.6 6 8.1.7 those three versions are also called as 8 I next 9 I 10 G 11G 12C 18 C 19 C 21 C 23 C these are the versions one of the latest version is 19 is a version number C is a cloud computing cloud technology only nowadays everyone knows cloud computing supported by cloud technology supported by all softares That's why Oracle is a product from Oracle Corporation 19c is a one of the version number Now check it out Screen observe it Uh what is this Oracle product now everyone knows this Oracle is a what type of product very good database product Suppose Java C++ net these type of softwares was implemented based on objectoriented features Same like here also some relational data model is a concept is there that based only they're implementing at least Okay this is a database product So now Oracle is a database product Oracle is a database product What is the purpose of database product everyone knows to store data permanently To store data permanently in secondary storage devices permanently in secondary storage devices Secondary storage devices up to this one maybe so many fellows having idea Now observe it here concentrate very very very important Now observe here this is a Oracle database Okay Oracle software Now check it out Concentrate here Now I'm installing a Oracle software in my system here on what's different observed here whenever I'm installing Oracle software in my system then automatically one place is reserved in a disk this is called database this is called Oracle database or database it is a place okay yeah now anybody guess it now in this database I try to store a what a any random collection of data possible or not possible Only one answer is correct Maybe guess it Anybody tell me any experienced persons are there in that place i try to you try to store a what random collection of data possible or not possible very good So many fellows are thinking what sir any collection of data also we are allowed to store they telling only Okay Any random collection of data also we are allowed to store in this database They're telling only that is 100% wrong Wrong one These database softwares either Oracle or SQL server MySQL DB2 CIA Informics Postgress ingress these type of database softwares was implemented based on a some special concept is there What is that one relational data model is a concept is there in a feature Don't worry That's why these databases does not store a random collection of data These databases stores a what structured collection of data Organized fashion only data is storing Observe here screen Observe it Yes here the data is there Organized fashion only data is there Observe it here This is called structured collection of data Actually relational data model was implemented by F code He is a mathematician In those days he is working in aware in IBM company that's why he only represented data in the format of table matrix because he's a mathematician That's why he is only designing that one only matrix format Now matrix are nothing but a what rows and columns are there No now matrix are nothing but what a table format only That's why anybody observing about what Oracle software SQL server software DB2 software MySQL software means in a table format only data is there That's why always observe it here Here this database software Okay Oracle database software stores a what which one structured collection of data organized fashion only data storing This is called structured collection of data Structured structured collection of data only it will be storing structured collection of data Once the structured collection of data is there in this database I am also you are also operating a what data in this database then we are using one specialized long base Anybody have an idea very good What is that long base spl is a long ways structured query longways This is a nonprocedural long ways Suppose in a C C long language is a procedure long way In that one loops are there variables are there So many things are there But here not like that This is a nonprocedure long ways Loops are not there Variables are not there Just simple Yes Same like English type commands are there Insert top date till it select match like this Some commands are there Just we are typing that commands automatically processing the water data that much of easiest long ways That's why this is a non okay nonprocedural log weights This long name is structured query long ways By using this long ways we are operating a data in this databases Now check it out For example now check it out Concentrate here really this is correct or not check it out Suppose this is a Oracle database in a future you are also installing a what this software how means I will tell you don't worry one of the days now check it out here observe it here here table format only data is available or not check it out yes here this is a table format only data is there or not yes here now organization ation only data is there Suppose here serial number is a column is there In this column only stores what numbers again in this column job is a column only stores what characters in this higher date is a column in this column only stores what dates that's why organized f only data is storing or not yes suppose for example yes number is a column is there in this table now suddenly I'm working in a company for example my client asking otherwise my requirement is this one And what is that one i want to change this S number column name These are columns only These are rows Don't worry And now this column name change into where s number into where employee number they're asking In that case I a good SQL programmer means I'm typing a what some English type commands like this just I am typing what some command in a future These commands you are also learning observe here yes once I'm typing a word that command automatically yes absolute here yes here in a previous case employee number is there in this case automatically that number is changing into where employee sorry in this in previous case s number is there now in this case automatically it will be changing or not how it is possible just here alter command I'm typing only this command is nothing but what SQL is a long ways structured query long database through this language only we are operating a data in Oracle database and now check it out observe it here suppose in a table format only data is there in a where in this type of relational data model now here check it out if it is a table in this table department number D name location these are columns these are predefined tables practice purpose they are providing you are also creating a what tables like this okay and Now observe here here concentrate here number of tables also available here like this suppose India is a table account number name open and a balance like this here data 101 morally 5th March 2025 here 5,000 is the balance like that's why always always always whenever we are operating our data in this database then we are using a what SQL language up to this one everyone knows but unfortunately screen observ Oracle database software then not only SQL language another language also you must familiar Or what is that one means i will tell you now Observe here If you want to operate a Oracle database then we are using a SQL language Another language What is that one means pl/sql is a long procedural language extension for SQL Again another language is dynamic SQL Dynamic dynamic SQL Dynamic SQL Dynamic SQL You don't have an ID also Not a problem by using these two languages So we are operating a what data in this Oracle database Very very important Suppose you are interested to work in aware in a Oracle database in a company side company side Compulsory you are good at what are these two languages One is SQL language Another one is what pl/sql language SQL is a non-procedural language PL/SQL means procedure longways concepts They're embedded in a SQL language Suppose whenever we are starting a what in our course in a feature then in that one these two long these three languages I will tell you in this SQL language which concepts we are learning now observe it here so many concepts are there observe here here in this SQL language now check it out maybe anybody having idea means main concepts DDL DML TCL DQL so many commands are there one of these days main concept Joins we are learning only joins are nothing but retrieve data from multiple tables left outer join full outer join right outer join so many self joins so many joints maybe Java net python developers also wellknown persons why those developers also learning about this course means I will tell you don't worry just observe it here in SQL language joins is a concept is there again so many concepts are there just terminology awareness purpose I'm telling kind Constraints is a concept is there chapters these are main chapters primary key foreign key check unique not these are called constraints again subquery is a chapter is there most powerful so now here subquery query within another query is called subquery suppose you are you are a Java programmer you are attending interview you're asking I want to retrieve second highest salary employee from particular table suppose EMP table I want to display nth is the salary employee details I want to display fifth salary employee details I want to delete a duplicate rows from a table how it is possible mean compulsory this subquery chapter side we are learning about what some queries how we are writing what is the construction what happened or anything again window functions are there rank dense rank lag lead analytical or window functions row number these all the things we are learning only these Main concepts much of concepts are there observe it here again in a PL/SQL here cursors exceptions so many concepts are there one of these days very very very important concept JavaNet Python these all programmers are most familiar stored procedures stored procedures is very very important okay stored procedures a concept we are learning that's why observe it here here three languages are there one is SQL another one One is PL/SQL Another one is dynamic SQL Roughly observe it here in our syllabus side So much of things are there Just the screen Observe it here One of the stage we are learning Okay Observe it here Yes Here in SQL means a basic after installation Here observed here in SQL long side DDL some commands DML TCL DQL these commands you are learning and also here some concepts only basic concepts how you are writing construction so many things are there One of the stage observe it here once you are good at what this select statement how we are constructing what execution we are learning Okay Yeah Now here after that one main concepts we are starting one of these stage joins Joins are nothing but retrie data from multiple tables Here observe here left outer join right outer joint pull outer join so many things are there or not Yes again once you are good at what that one and now then constraints is a chapter is there in SQL long side not unique primary key for any key check so many things are there once we are good at what that one then only here top query is a chapter is there query within another query very big chapter this one not only good database also once you are good at what those subquery chapter After then only we are learning here some database objects are there sequences synonyms indexes so many database objects are there not only that one advanced concepts we are learning about in that SQL long side one minute observed here here decode and K statements that is nothing but a What set operators and conversions are there very important chapter that before that one TCL commands are there transaction control language that is commit roll back save point like this here here case statement decode statement NLS parameter so many things are there here not only that one anybody good at what loops mechanism means level is a pseudo column is there through that one possible in a Java C++ loops we are writing same thing here also something is there and Now here observe it here not only that one anybody good at what JavaNet Python Unix those type of languages means regular expressions is a concept is there that is also available in aware Oracle 10g version onwards Oracle side these regular expressions very very important most powerful posics annotations maybe so many Java developers are wellknown persons but very easy way I'm designing only those things easy understandable these all symbols only these meta ctors Now through that one how we are uh okay intro questions you are facing a problem phone number validations or other card the phone number validations based on the conditions again other card validations and also pawn card validations observe it here in a Java developer attending interview side email validations how we are using a what here conard validation Here other card is available No Yeah Indian person side author card validation These all the things we are learning award in this SQL long ways Once you are completing a what that SQL longways for operating a data in Oracle database extension of the SQL PL/SQL you are learning only procedural longways extension for SQL One minute observe here Yes PL/SQL also so much of syllabus is there here this is a PL/SQL in this because so much of syllabus why I'm designing mean some fellows are okay applying a job is about PL/SQL developer without any knowledge to SDS any gap is there those persons easily getting a job here PL/SQL procedure language extension for SQL PL/SQL introduction cursor is a concept we are learning again exception runtime errors are there no try catch throw finally is there in a normal languages no but here After that one stored procedure is a concept This is only important very very important in parameter out parameter in out parameter How we are passing a values from Java into where database database into Java So now our Python these all the things I will tell you in a way in parameter out parameter in out parameter so many things are there here triggers up to this one is enough but some fellows are PL/SQL developer jobs they are applying means these type of advanced concepts also they have an idea better these are collections index table nested table vance tuning concept of bulk bind here rift cursors are there how can I pass a cursor as a parameter into the where in a procedures here UTL file packages most powerful external tables and SQL loaders Again some Java developers are storing a images How mean is a data type is there or not after that one only dynamic SQL I will tell you that much of thing is there one minute of the here in a feature Okay today only know just slowly I'm showing you what that syllabus only Okay just don't afraid only Okay because one of the stage you are very good knowledge only Uh now here one by one one by one we are learning is very easy these all things are available Now once you are learning like that okay then you're learning about what dynamic SQL dynamic SQL is optional but better to know at least some basic knowledge only Now observe it here Here a dynamic SQL is a language is there SQL SQL statements are executed at runtime Here execute immediate class is there Something is there Okay These are all the things we are learning one of these days Okay not only that one in the realtime concept side how your procedures areuling job scheduleuler is there DBMS scheduleuler is a package is there in 11g same like olden days DBMS job package is there now through that one those all the things we are learning only that's why always you are learning about what in a future three languages one is SQL another one is PL/SQL another one is dynamic SQL just observe it here terminology Oracle is a product from Oracle Corporation What type of product this one database product But unfortunately so many these type of database products are there Not only Oracle relational data model concept based only implemented so many database products are there Anybody tell me some database products popular database products from different different companies Anybody tell me anybody Java developers are there in our class or Python developers are there tell me very good Oracle is a popular database product from Oracle Corporation This is also implemented based on relational data model concept That's why a table format only data is storing Now again very good one is telling SQL server is a database product from Microsoft Again MySQL very good MySQL is a database product from nowadays Oracle Corporation that is a open source anybody having idea any other software very good DB2 is a what from IBM company again terra data very good ter data from NCR corporation again Saiase from Ingress company again postgress from ingress company like that Okay So many database softwares are there in those all database softwares are also SQL language is there common language What is the difference means I will tell you one of the st again procedures s store procedure these type of concepts are there Suppose SQL server language you are learning means in that one also SQL is there and TSQL is there in that TSQL in Oracle set PL/SQL is there no same like TSQL is there in that one stored procedure curses the exceptions these all the things are available similar concepts but slides and taxes are different functions are different I will tell you that's why always always Oracle is a product from Oracle corporation this is a database product so what is the purpose of that database product means to store data permanently in secondary storage devices suppose for example I want to create a what bank is a table in my project for example don't write it just once you are good at what SQL language these type of commands you are typing only now here in this one suppose I'm taking a what account Number is a color Number like this don't write it Observe it here again Name is a color where cat like this In a feature you are good at what these all the things Comma balance is a color like this Now I know you know SQL long ways that's why you are typing what some commands like this automatically possible Now here suppose some employee uh some account number account holders details I try to store in this database table now 101 here suppose my name morally here my balance is something only I try to store for example and now here 102 here ABC is a account holder here 3,000 is a balance I try to store observe it here again 103 three here XY Z is account holder here 5,000 is a balance now again today I try to credit some amount again 101 okay now yeah my name is Mori for example I try to credit a what some amount 1,000 rupees for example now again 1 minute absolute here why I'm telling this one mean you Understandable 102 not only storing purpose so many things are there in a database just idea purpose I'm showing only now here 2,000 rupees for example now check it out for example this is a table format only details are available okay in this database on project side observe bank details for example roughly here observe it here a bank is a table is there in that bank account number is there 101 morally 8,000 102 ABC balance is 3,000 103 XY Z 5,000 balance 101 morally 1,000 is a balance 102 ABC 2,000 is a balance suppose this total balance I want to display in a report how can I mean 8,000 plus 3,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 plus 2,000 manually calculating difficult no in that case yes you are a good SQL programmer means not only storing a data we are processing the data by using some commands we are typing only sum of balance here we are typing like this only from don't write it just here bank like this why we are learning SQL language I will tell you suppose 19,000 automatically displayed or not yes that's why you are a good professional SQL language knowledge you have an idea then you are writing a what in a way in this coding then any end user clicking a what some button then automatically yes this is okay database affected and printed side it is visible now check it out suppose I don't want like this only I want to display these all the columns along with along with along with okay so now this the sum of total balance possible now here observe it here now I try to use like this now check it out here table what is the table name bank is a table dot star is all columns I try to display like this it won't Okay Why because this is a aggregate function You are trying to display along with columns It won't work only That is you are experienced person then only you have an idea Normally you don't have an idea Just observe it here technical concept It won't work Here in this case you are a good experienced person in a future you are learning these courses Now here we are converting that one into where analytical function then only possible W is a clause we are using means then possible These all the things you don't have an idea later you are familiar just I'm intimating to you so many things are there you are learning in a future you are a good professional means like this observe it here yes automatically it will display what total balance in each and every okay so record side automatically or not yes again each and every okay account holder balance I total balance I want means just we are writing a what partition by is a clause is there Total balance here name wise I am writing now check it out here now I try to use like this observe it here yes here ABC account holder total balance is 3,000 + 2,000 there is a 5,000 again morally account holder having a 8,000 plus 1,000 That is a total balance is 9,000 Again XY Z account holder is 5,000 This type of knowledge you have an idea SQL these are SQL commands only you have an idea then only we are generating that's why processing a data purpose also we are using a what yes here these databases are not yes how efficiently we are retrieving a data fetching a data based on the client requirement that is important that's why you are learning about what this long what happened what is going on what is this one those all the things you are good means then automatically you are also handling the projects very easy now here observe it here suppose each and every group only uh now a total balance I want for example this a table is there select a star from bank like this now here check it out morally total balance how much here this is 8,000 plus 1,000 that is a 9,000 again ABC account holder is a what 3,000 plus 2,000 that is 5,000 xyz account holder is 5,000 now I want to produce a report each and every account holder how much total balance is there means group by is a clause is there in a every database SQL language What is the all databases SQL language differences also I will tell you one of these days Now here name sum of balance like this here from bank only and now here check it out here group by here I write typing like this this is a SQL longest command here like this then this SQL longest command through you are displaying a what morally here 9,000 ABC account holder having a 5,000 again xyz is a what 5,000 is the total balance is available or not SQL this is the way okay so we are generating a what reports that's why always processing data purpose we are using a what this SQL language just once data is there in a way in your tables then we are according to client requirement we are generating these type of reports or not then only we are using a what SPL is a long suppose these type of database languages are not visible to the end user These type of database long wages are not visible to the end user or customer For example you are purchasing items today holy so many offers are there anywhere Amazon or Flipkart or anything you are interested to purchase any items means just go to where okay so now here w.flip.com flipkart.com amazon.com you are typing only in that case you are interested to purchase a what one item or any item means observe it here observe suppose I try to purchase a what shirt for example now whenever I a customer I don't know anything just here item name shut I am clicking only for example whenever I'm clicking what this one so many items are there but only shirts are visible to the where end user how means Here within a database internally what happened same like you only some professionals are writing a what coding like this here select star from observe it here this is SQL coding select star from item where okay some table roughly where item name is equal to so now shut like this then automatically from the table this all shuts information it will be displayed here now I don't want to display this All shirts only I want to display Okay Uh so the blue shirt only I want to purchase Suppose I am selecting what so many list of colors are there Here blue color I'm selecting only How how it is possible just observe here here database programmer same like you only some database programmers writing a coding like this and is an operator and color color is equal to blue they are writing Okay Yeah So now here like this again all the colors I don't want to display again my size is 40 size I want to display means I want to purchase just here I'm selecting a 40 size how it is possible filtering the data means and size is equal to 40 like this that's why this type of coding is called internally happened okay now some software professionals they're writing only explicitly we are clicking what like this These all the things are data is retrieved from where in a database only This is called SQL longways That's why these SQL professionals are required in a company side structured query long ways But today whole you know these are problem Okay Yeah And now roughly just today small concept I am telling only I'm not starting anything Oracle is a product from Oracle Corporation This is a what type of product database product What is the purpose of this one to store data permanently in secondary storage devices If you want to operate a data in a Oracle database then we are using a what languages SQL comma PL/SQL Another one is what dynamic SQL languages Okay Understood this one Up to this one so many things are there Extension that is next class side I will tell you Anybody having any doubts please ask me Hello Hello Hello Hello Uh this course is not a fee Okay Not a Okay Fees only Don't pay any fees here This course is what free Okay Yeah Duration is more than three and a half months Okay Yeah Utilize this knowledge only So much of things are there very helpful in aware in a software industry side Okay 9 to 10 only class timings 9 is there 10 is there 11 is there Okay Evening 4 5 6 7 So many batches are there But this one free badge 9 to 10 Okay Yeah Anybody having any doubts yes One fellow is asking only sir I am not a technical person I want to learn SPL as possible Yes uh recording and any okay PDFs are required mean you have to contact management they are asking about payment okay normally course is free okay yeah are you coming tomorrow otherwise uh Monday we will start that is better today holy know that's why so many are not outside also so many functions Okay Now thank you so much for attending this small demo class Next class will be on Monday Monday will continue Thank you Okay Monday will continue Thank you That is better Okay Monday onwards we are starting Monday will continue Thank you Hello Hello Hello Hello Good morning to everybody Can you hear me it is audible now Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Yeah Anybody not attending previous class don't worry That is a small demo class Small concept I told that class only Observe it here What I told in that class just observe it here Oracle is a product from Oracle Corporation That is a basically a database product Whenever we are installing this database product in our system then automatically some places reserved in aware in a hard disk that is called database Whenever Oracle or SQL server DB2 CIA Informics these softwares we are installing means automatically one container is created that is nothing but a database actually Oracle SQL server these are DBMS softwares What is that database container means all are thinking about database stores database stores data permanently in a secondary storage devices in that container that is a hard disk only everyone thinking but unfortunately that is not true Oracle or SQL server or DB2 or cybase or informics or ingress or postgress these softwares are was implemented based on a one concept relational data model that's why that's why already I told in a previous classes always Those software stores a what structured collection of data observed here this one I'm telling structured collection of data organized fashion only data is storing why that is store that that type of way it will be storing means reason is there EF chord he is working in aware he was working in aware in a olden days IBM company he is only introducing a what a relational data model basically he's a mathematician that's why he is representing ing data in the format of rows and columns only That is nothing but a matrix He's a mathematician that's why say matrix format only there nowadays storing award data in the format of tables Up to that one we are discussing award in a previous class Observe it here Here structured collection of data is there Again I'm repeating only why because some pillows are not added in previous classes Now observe it here This is a structured collection of data not Yes Once structured collection of data is there in these bases then I am you are also developers or in this data one language SQ language for example this is a table there I can provide a predefined post don't worry just practice purpose here New York is a example my client requirement is change this New York location into higher location in this table they're asking Then I am also here also typing out what some commands here like this update here set your location is equal to hydraod where some coding we are writing only these type of coding is also called as DML coding that is insert update delete commands only that is nothing but what SQL long way observe here one line of coding I'm typing what is that one also familiar now check it out here star from table d here in a previous case New York is a location is there but in this case what is a location is there why because I'm typing what some command only this command is what SQL long this maybe so many fellow having area this long also introduced by that what structure long this is simple English language to language only we are operating a data in for a database for all relational databases Okay Yeah Again not only that one if you want to this Oracle then using languages one another one is extended that is PL/SQL Another one is SQL statements are executed runtime that is called SQL At least these two languages you are good sql then software you're operating what database up to this one just observe it here up to this one we are discussing only okay yeah now one is asking required classes give or ask mans now very important up to this one concentrate very important most powerful simple concept these are demo classes just observe it here first time newcomer purpose some customer what my doubt today I'm working here I'm working for example warle project is a based product but I'm also my colleagues also opening a data in this Oracle database we are long What is that longware okay Up to this one But unfortunately my company software company so many project different project also Suppose for example same similar database technology another product is another project is there For example now SQL server is a Microsoft product Same like Ora SQL server is a database product corporation Some employees are working in this model product who are working in aware in this database product Those persons also those employees also operating data It is SQL server using which language SQL again same like database this is also relational database only now who are the employees are working in this project those employees also data in MySQL database use SQL language now all SQL languages are same are different I'm confusing only maybe anybody get python on academic career side they are good at what maybe database software that's why I'm asking this question anybody answer is correct some employees are working in SQL server some employees are working in aware are working in a some employees are working employees are working in ingress some employees areing data those software but all languages are same or different only So many fellows are telling not very good who are telling very why so many DBMS paper is there maybe one maybe level they telling only there is a problem here insert update delete set commands maybe the software side commands are safe is there similar telling about 1.3 all SQL languages are not safe not how languages are not same simple technique is there not how you very very very important that's why first check it out here anybody good at what side Java easy you are remembering you never mistaken anything anybody asking also now check it Concentrate concentrate again five minutes concentrate suppose slowly observed here through this example is understandable now check it out so many fellows are good at what C++ means don't here what is going C plus object oriented long ways again another popular long ways object oriented long Java is a object oriented long ways is C++ is an object oriented language and Java also an object oriented language in object orient side object oriented features are there maybe so many fellows having idea what is object what is class what inheritance some concepts are there Yeah don't worry In an article in a technical person mean they have no idea And now these type of polymer person these are called objectoriented features in a Java also object oriented features are there Same object here object oriented features are there What are the objected features are there in a in a Java okay What is object class inheritance encapsulation polymeism these type of things are there or not Okay Here also what is object what is class what is inheritance what is polymorphism is these are same Now check it out Check it out So for example want to create an object from the class What is object what is class i am not interested to tell the don't worry But unfortunately a single person how we are creating a what an object from the class in a C++ create an object means object created from the class but object okay only what is the syntax create object from the class here what is the syntax very good class name class name space object Class name space object name is nothing about how create an object from the class in a side different you are only tell me a technical process very same mean wrong

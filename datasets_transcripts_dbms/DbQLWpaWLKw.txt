foreign so first what is data okay data ante normal okay data means information piece of informational matter under information log part okay eventually like facts figures okay information foreign foreign [Music] process JC or interpreted JC okay then organization result okay our results collection of raw facts okay information identity a collection of raw vaccine a piece of information organizations okay foreign okay in simple words you can you can say a database in a place where data is stored database okay so the best example Japan is a collection of data collection of related information so a collection of related information okay example suppose library is so what is Library so library and a collection of books particular place okay librarian examples foreign appropriate security measures foreign it consists of group of programs which manipulate the database okay database consists of a group of programs a group of programs no manipulate means okay dbms concept okay application ninchi okay instruction follow to a dbm machine is um particular okay foreign foreign foreign foreign database database entity structured data collection of structured data and matter our collection of related data okay particular person in China okay particularly in China okay collection of data okay database foreign thank you Andy bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel Heroes Mano file system so previous classroom dbms your introduction allocate database and entity data and TNT information so what is file system so file system foreign foreign okay foreign foreign structure foreign okay a programming languages primitive backup or recovery like the complex structure so it is duplication of data ah can be minimized duplicate data is okay foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign multiple user interfaces okay one of the advantage disadvantages cost of software and Hardware okay e software software Hardware it requires number of high powered process okay foreign [Music] okay so incontinentic complexity complexity and in the dbms ads and in additional layers of complexity to the data logical structure oriented particular authorized database particular instructions [Music] security problems okay higher impact of failure okay higher impact of failure on day in the um losing the data since all data is stored at a single location okay data is centralized located please [Music] any advantage of dbms lengthy control database redundancy okay so okay data sharing okay data sharing at a multiple users maintenance disadvantage okay Heroes agenda okay thank you for watching bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel Heroes manam applications of dbm is clearly file systems applications okay normal time information database database so now dbms used to maintain all information related to books issues okay e dbms your information like storage [Music] database so we all know there will be a thousand transactions okay Bangalore thousands of transactions of transactions okay allow foreign maintaining dbms to store student registration details results course and grades all information in the database e database and universities like um so for example telecommunication okay so without dbms there is no telecommunication company okay communication systems Telecommunications the most useful to their companies to store the call details and monthly postpaid bills Telecommunications to purchase of items and transactions of credit card are made possible by dbms okay dbms transactions like purchase purchase items so a credit card holder has to know the importance of their information that all are secured through dbms which is so all the information related to users are stored and maintained with help of Dimensions data stored and maintained by the dbms lot of things to do with the finance like storing sales holding information and finance statement management Etc so e-finance law Manuela is just not like the database like storing like a store sales database systems records of soldiers and it has so many files that should be kept secure and safe records and day soldiers okay Soldier personal details foreign so online shopping online shopping at an updates so without wasting by going to shopping okay online shopping in the range is Source management Human Resource Management learning the management keeps records of each employee so implies your like each record like salary tax and work honey so we demand dbm is new which is so thank you only bye foreign Ty videos so what is the purpose of database to make database user friendly and to easy operations okay user friendly ground atom and operations database systems so users can easily insert update and delete so users operations so actually the main purpose of is to have more control of the data so data made a complete control energy databases of database systems data redundancy and inconsistency okay 20 difficulty in accessing data encoding data isolation Equity atomicity of updates included in a concurrent access incontinent is security problems incontinent is support multiple views of data so video next slide low so further foreign if data okay if there are multiple copies of this same data same data multiple copies and together so what the average just avoid it okay it just maintains data in a single repository is single Repository foreign through difficult queries okay it through different queries e different queries it can data it can access data from the database okay e difficulty in accessing data isolation so what is data isolation isolated in several fields in the same database same data analysis different fields laws several fields of updates okay automatic normally automatic games okay 20 concurrent access he concurrent axis multiple access to the database database at the same time foreign incontinent is security problems e security problems okay support multiple views of data multiple views of data attendant it can support multiple views of data to give the required view of as their needs multiple views so okay only database admin can have complete view of the database okay database a complete view of data remaining us database we cannot allow the end users to have view of the developers okay now ND is an indie user is thank you for watching bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel components of dbm is applications software Hardware procedures and data and users okay if I could amount of components of dbms so foreign foreign hello next is your Hardware so what is Hardware Hardware [Music] storage this component of dbms consists of a set of physical electronic devices such as computer input output channels storage devices Etc so even nicoda okay interfacing create interface computer key and user dbms data storage okay data stories okay this dbms components is used for keeping and storing the data in the database okay so EDB means component changes into a normal storage purpose okay procedures refers to general rules and instructions okay rules and instruction reference procedure okay design the database database set of rules set of instructions so procedure are used to set up and install a new database management system a dbm is an install okay then manage okay easy set of software application so if we don't need any backup gunny we didn't need okay data data construction is the resource set of instruction set of software and content okay resources so the motive behind the creation of dbms was to store and utilize data data stored and then utilize saved data is present and metadata is stored okay you come meta data and Storage okay so metadata and in the data about data okay metadata entity data about data okay data uh so for example uh related information is [Music] different types of operations on the database is management system okay e username different types of operations database okay our users like application programmer and database administrator and end user E3 types of users okay one is application programmer encoded database administrator in good end user so clearly okay database foreign three kind of okay components of dbms low so this is the end of the topic so e video making a channel thank you for watching bye foreign okay so how data will be stored data stories relational model so foreign foreign okay okay department is students and teachers okay so our students like children's teacher related subjects in the school to student student to uh student details school to teachers teachers to uh his details hello like eerie more related data attachation okay it is foreign okay menu too many relationship only so next to choose entity relationalship model number okay e entity relationship mode some entities entity relationship so different entities are related using relationships are defined to represent the relationships into ah pictorial form to make it easier for different stakeholders and understand foreign um attribute constant entities in this condom okay and it is in this attributes students okay so for example pictorial representation is attribute okay is relationships so foreign foreign modeling okay so the ninjas um also known as a relational in relational Model E tables tables okay relational database student ID okay foreign thank you for watching bye hi today our topic is view of data okay so data view is so what is view of data okay data abstractions so instances data access units okay [Music] so the developer achieved this by hiding these complex data structures through level of abstraction e level of obstruction abstraction levels data structure like yellow design in the a model of storage the structure and the complex complicated chassis foreign so while changing the data schema at one level of the database must not modify the data schema at Next Level okay vocal levels okay questions you know data abstraction including data Independence including instance and schema okay hiding the complex data structure in order to simplify the user's interface of the system okay username interface complex data structures so it is done because many of the users interacting like um okay is okay okay [Music] Independence data Independence is so data schema can be changed at one level without modifying the data schema at the next level okay okay um logical data Independence and the physical data independence first is The Logical data Independence so logical data Independence logical or conceptual schema internet logical level okay storage okay logical level okay deleting more entities okay throughout the entity sets okay changing the constraint of data kind of uh like uh actually kind of operations kind of okay okay particular um okay okay okay okay so the number of examples foreign thank you for watching bye thank you foreign foreign level up foreign [Music] foreign foreign water okay we adding constraints to the view of data adds the security okay level of e logical level okay so as user are restricted to access some particular parts of the database database administrator is like database administrator okay developer okay developers modifications okay view level or user level or external level and logical levels okay okay so normal particular example a database particular physical or logical available entities logical level foreign foreign foreign [Music] thank you for watching bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel disadvantages so what is normalization normalization is database design law okay designing of database in foreign database normalization so database normalization under the engine group of related data in one single table okay okay group of related data single table so okay any attributes okay any at attributive data or indirectly related to data are put in the different tables and these tables are connected with a logical relationship between parent and child tables okay attribute to data or indirectly related data e different like tables different different tables connectivity and matter okay okay parent and child related tables relationships data for large shared banks okay so is also a multiple tables made on a connectivity okay okay different different tables on different different tables parent and child uh relationship database normalization okay next Advantage Advantage cntv so economic Avengers increase data consistency okay normalization use test managers now data consistency no matter okay increases duplicate data okay you duplicate data in a normal unnecessary case storage grouping or related data a particular schema someone is um okay normally database online uh okay so disadvantage but advantages disadvantages we cannot find the associative data first I say a product or employee okay associated okay foreign okay so for example if tables are entity and cocoa tables and entities and go so what learner columns best example okay so even the heroes classes normalization uses into okay then you could disadvantage into uh this is thank you for watching bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel actually Heroes classical normal forms so normal forms so normal forms first normalization and TNT so our procedure the previous classroom explains first normal form and second normal form and the third normal form and do bcnf and a Boy Scout normal form and the fourth normal formula Euros okay so first first normal form so first to normal for maintained and a normal relationships attributes okay multi-valued attributes so the table or relation should contain only single valued attributes single valued attributes so single value attributes normal foreign so normal double double phone numbers okay single valued attribution second normal form is foreign foreign [Music] foreign okay foreign foreign foreign okay vertical subject uh non-prime attributes is okay so fast students okay first student attribute students score ID subject ID okay student ID marks okay so marks marks anime student ID means student ID subjects e normal foreign so normal format and a voice code normal form next day so biasco normal form and advanced version of three enough okay already is okay so functional dependencies functional dependencies foreign foreign country foreign foreign okay for example single value okay depends foreign foreign okay fourth normal formula is first normal foreign bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel heroism so what are the keys data based on a relationships is particular number of students so for example students foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign you know um but okay complete uh attributes okay super key is okay so for example just going to take a student table this kind of student table or student ID and atheist student ID is student name is so what is foreign key foreign keys are the column of table used to point the primary keys of another table okay foreign foreign foreign okay foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign rectangular okay entity weak entity so weak entity and um okay foreign four types of time okay four types of time to be key attribute and down composite and term multi-valued attributes and down derivative attribute Center so now first key attribute key attribute main characteristics of an entity and matter okay main characteristics okay the composite attribute composite attribute multiple attributes for example is middle name is known as a composite attribute okay okay related attributes so okay more than one value is okay uh foreign age changes over time and can be derived from another attribute like date of birth okay person is [Music] now name this roll number is relationship so what is relationship relationships okay okay one to one relationship one to many relationships so first one to one relationship so one to one relationships okay foreign okay foreign foreign okay so many to many relationships topic so er diagrams okay okay entities okay entity relationships thank you for watching bye hi welcome to python life YouTube channel database language so what is database languages what is definition of database so definition of database entending so data an ID what it would be contained okay and there is a relationship between data so database database database schema or database foreign language okay ddl and data manipulation language and data control language and transaction control language so these are the four types of database languages okay database language um so First Data definition language so data definition language ENT the language is used to create database and tables alter okay Etc and also rename the database or drop them okay data definition languages okay it specifies the database schema okay data definition language is used to store the information of metadata like the numbers of tables and schemas their names indexes columns in each table con constraints okay normal data definition language and schemas and what you can names what your indexes um indexes and columns of each table okay so normally Command Center okay our Command Center so data definition language learner Command Center create any comments just now okay use it to create objects okay objects is going to modify the structure of existing table okay already existing modifications okay and go to drop then you just gonna just now delete objects from database use it to comment on the data dictionary okay included data manipulation language data manipulation language manager 70 the language is used to manipulate the database like inserting data updating data retriving data of record from a table okay so e-long with new UCS connection down data manipulated updates privileges to a user using the grant statement in the same way privilege using revoke the statement okay if you interest both statements data control language to access the database database take back the Privileges to access the database okay [Music] [Music] set a point in a transaction to roll back later first exercise it is used to restore the database to original commit um thank you for watching bye foreign okay all type of database access operations which are held between the beginning and end transaction statements are considered as single logical transaction in database okay foreign foreign [Music] almost all transaction maybe almost all complete in a tomato okay partially completed committed stage committed statement is completely successfully independent okay change from one consistent state to another okay database failed State under so failed State and appliances partially committed State committed State failed State and terminated state so foreign foreign [Music] okay foreign okay uh execution first active State question is okay foreign state okay if the success like about about its in the active State okay okay um [Music] foreign okay [Music] foreign disadvantage disadvantages foreign thank you for watching bye foreign the acid properties are meant for the transaction that goes through a different group of tasks okay different group of tasks e acid properties acid properties acid properties okay normal acid properties acid properties so as it properties are four properties NTA and a first the atomicity equity consistency isolation durability E4 properties okay E4 properties so E4 properties atomicity so what is as atomicity atomicity operations [Music] okay it means if any operation is performed on the data either it should be performed or executed completely foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign the data always should be correct okay a is equal to 600 B is equal to 200 okay either before transaction either before transition after transaction is 500 plus 300 is equal to 800 okay 300 in the foreign foreign where no data should affect the other one and may occur concurrently so concurrent content it is okay foreign foreign foreign foreign x value y value foreign durability so what is durability so durability durability ensures the permanency of something in dbms in terms durability ensures that the data after successful execution of a operation becomes permanent in the database operations um foreign in maintaining the consistency and availability of data in the database consistency maintenance normal database each and every money transactions for example for example is um um Okay so um consistency [Music] normal isolation isolation um thank you for watching bye

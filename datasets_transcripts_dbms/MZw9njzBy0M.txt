the data is a raw fact that needs to be processed so when it got processed then we call that as an information database is meant or it's developed in order to satisfy a specific purpose so the so that here you can see a list of application where we can use this database moreover metadata is one of the information but it is holding the details about another information then we call that as a meta whenever we have a multiple users accessing to the database at the time they must ensures that only one transaction should takes place foreign [Music] welcome to one and all welcome to the very first session on the chapter one of the unit one in the bca's third semester subject called database management system in short it is dbms I'm rohini TS Department of computer science vidyashram first grade College the Temple of excellence mysuru in our today session we are going to learn about the introduction to database system and what are its application where and all we are going to use this database before that you will get to know what is data what is information what is database what is database management system along with that I will be discussing what are the characteristics and purpose we have with this database approach and also I will discuss who are all the people associated with this database system that is what address on the scene actors behind the scene that is what we will be discussing at the end of this session let me get into the first session that is regarding what introduction to database system here so before I understand learning what is database what is database management system first you all need to understand what is data correct that is what a basic fundamental thing data is a raw fact that needs to be processed simply if I'm writing param 12. so somehow it is meaningless I don't know what this 12 is all about what does this varam is all about instead of if I'm writing like this name is equal to param and age is equal to 12 that is more informative so the data is a raw fact that needs to be processed so when it got processed then we call that as an information so when I have a logically related data when I have a collection of logically related data then we call that as a database here you can see that First Data is what that is the fact and statistics which is going to be stored or free flowing over a network so moreover it is what raw facts and unprocessed if it is processed then we call that as an information so when the data is Meaningful when data is used in order to make a certain decision then we call that as an information so when a data is processed turning it into some meaningful things then we are calling that as an information fine we got to know what is data what is information then what what is this database why do we require I have a data if it is logically related to each other so for example you have a cupboard so in that you are going to store your closet that means you are going to keep your t-shirts once you are going to keep your jeans one side that means what are we going to keep the vegetables or fruits in the cloth cupboard no right why because we are keeping the logically related data there must be some meaningful things or there must be some relationship between the object what and all we are storing there so this database is also like that only so database is a collection of logically related data the data needs to be logically related to each other then only we call that as a database and which is going to be organized in a way that data can be easily accessed managed and updated if you wanted to remove any of the shirts from that set you can do it easily if you want to add one more cloth to that particular a set of class that also you can do easily that means what when a database is a logically related to each other if it is having a collection of logically related to each other data then it will going to be easy in the terms of what updating managing and even accessing then we call that as a database moreover it is going to always represent some aspects of a real word you can take the example of employee so that employees of a particular organization will going to have a logical relationship between one Department to another department they are all logically related to each other if I have a data about the employee that can be easily allow us going to do the modification and accessing as well as doing the updation so always this database we're going to represent some real word elements or it always represents the aspects of real word and also it is logically coherent collection of data within inherent meaning so everything is logically related to each other moreover we are going to build it for a specific purpose so if you are building a database for college or for the company or any of the universities so all these will going to satisfy a specific purpose then we call that as what data base moreover it is used to organize the data in the form of a table we are going to use the table Concept in the database the table comprises of rows and columns in the rows we are going to feed the data in the column we represents the attribute as of now you just need to understand what and all will going to be used in order to represent that later you will get to know what is stable what a schema what is views how we are going to do this reports everything that you will be learning in the coming sessions as of now you all need to understand what database is all about fine you got to know data information database in order to maintain this database I require one intelligent software then we are calling the that as a database management system so database management system in short it is dbms we have a data we have a meaningful information and we have a logically related data as a collection that is database in order to maintain that database we require one software then we are calling that as a database management system so a software which is going to allow us to create a definition and manipulation of the database I can create a database if I'm creating a database then it will be a collection of table views report everything will be there so with the help of this dbms we can create Define and manipulate the database and also it allowing the users in order to store process as well as analyze the data easily with the help of this dbms or a database management system software we can do allowing the user to store the process data and we can also analyze it we can do the manipulation updation creation of it database everything can be takes place with the help of this dbms and also it is going to provides us with an interface this is what we have a data we are the user in between we require some interface in order to make a communication between the data as well as with a user so this dbms will going to access an interface in order to or a tool in order to perform various operation that operation may be what creation of a database and storing a data in the database and also updating that data creation of your table in the database and lot more we can do with the help of this dvms software and also this is growing to provide the product protection so if you think about the data somehow it is confidential sensitive and also we have a private data so if I wanted to use this software then it has to provide protection and security to the database then only without any fear people can use that correct that is what the reason we have a database management system here and also it is going to maintain the data consistency in the case of multiple user for example you can take the example of bookmyshow so you will get to know how many seats are vacant how many seats are filled but do you uh do you really get to know who is the user or who is the people one who is coming there who is booking this particular seat we won't get to know right why because this is protect it is providing a security and protection to the data and also it is going to have a data consistency if there is a consistency then the data will going to be somehow secure all these we can get with the help of this dbms then what are the example we have for this dbms you can see here we have a MySQL Oracle SQL server and IB IBM db2 that is database 2. so all these are the some of popular dbms system that we have here fine next we'll see what are the database system application now I got to know what is database and what are the application where in all the field we have where we are going to use this database earlier you know that database is meant or it's developed in order to satisfy a specific purpose so that here you can see a list of application where we can use this database so it consists of banking anyway if you consider the bank as an application then it has to store the details about the loans it has to store the detail about daily transaction what is happening in a bank and who are all the users or overall the account holders who are all coming for the check verification so many things we have in a bank so that all the logical related data will going to be stored with the help of this database and also we can have this water meter building that is what the reason but every month we are getting the water meter building even uh Keb bill or electrical bill so all those are coming based on some application here and also we have our train and Airlines so in order to hold the details regarding the number of airplanes is uh the arriving and departuring its timings so all those data needs to be stored somewhere else for that also we can use this database and schools and colleges for educational purpose and credit card transaction that is what the reason monthly what Randall Bill we are getting due we are getting as a notification everything is maintained and managed by this database and also we have a finance related application sales number of good source and what is the Inward and out word of a particular sale manufacturing every detail needs to be stored and also telecommunication the number of calls main number of messages received messages sent all those details needs to be stored in this database and for the team of manufacturing and also human resources that includes in all the organization or company in order to hold the data regarding the employee so somehow the application that we have here this is the first one that is what in with respect to Telecom or telecommunication so this is what we are going to use this database in order to keep track of the information regarding calls made Network usage and also customer details who are all the customer we have what is their mobile number how much data they are using what number of calls main number of messages received sent every detail notes needs to be stored that we can done with the help of this database and if you consider the industry application and here also they are going to have a manufacturing unit and also warehouse and distribution center everything needs to be stored so for that each one needs a database in order to keep record of ins and outs that means what is its inward outward everything needs to be stored accessed by the database and also we have a banking system so in order to create a day-to-day activities or a transaction that needs to be keep on tracking that is what we require this database in order to store the banking details and also we have a sales with respect to this sales it is going to show the customer information production information invoice detail what are the bill amount every data needs to be saved and also for the purpose of Airlines if you consider the airlines so here we can make a early reservation this reservation information along with a flying schedule is stored in the database that is what the reason whenever you are booking something you are going to get the notification and also you can keep track on its delivery so that in the educational sector in order to store the details about a student and their personal details faculty details and the group details whatever the person who are all the people one who is associated with the educational sector everything needs to be Keep On Track and that needs to be stored so payroll details and the student fee detail and their academic detail any curriculum activities takes place all those detail needs to be maintained for that reason also in the purpose of educational sector we are going to use this database fine so these are all the application next we'll see what is the characteristics or what are the the characteristics and what is the purpose of this DBA approach that is database approach so here you need to make a comparison between the file system and the database management system so somehow file system is what's low and it is not so efficient when we make a comparison with a dbms and also protection is less and what the security measures is also going to be less in the file system in order to overcome all the disadvantages of file system we have this database management system so by keeping the disadvantages of file system we are producing these characteristics and purpose of this database approach so in that first we have a self-describing nature of a database system that means what it is keep on tracing on itself it's not going to store only the database structure along with that it is going to store something else that I will discuss and then insulation between the programs and the data as well as we have a data abstraction and then it will going to support a multiple views of the data then sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing so these are the characteristics that we have with respect to this database approach we'll see the first one here what is the first characteristics that is self-describing nature of a database system so in this self-describing in the sense what the database or a logically related data it is not only showing what database is all about along with that it will going to include the complete definition of a schema complete definition of a database along with its structure as well as constraint constraints are what set of rules and regulation which needs to be hold by the data which and all we are feeding to the database so database is not only containing the details regarding a database along with that it will going to include the structure its definition as well as the constraint so whenever the data is stored in all its catalog then we are calling that as a catalog that catalog is also considered as what metadata data about a data is called metadata it's like a index index of your book so index is also what one of the data but that is holding a data about another data there you can see what is the serial number what is the chapter name along with the page number so if I go to that page number again I can get the data so data about data is called metadata that feature we have in this database it is going to include the details regarding a database along with that it will going to hold the details regarding database definition and its structure as well as schema then constraint then we call that catalog or database catalog as a metadata so that it describes the structure of database how the database should be what are the number of tables we have what is its con constraints or set of rules and regulation which means needs to be followed every details were going to be stored you can see here the information stored in the catalog is called the metadata moreover metadata is one of the information but it is holding the details about another information then we call that as a metadata and we're all going to use this metadata or overall the user of this catalog one who is getting a benefit from this catalog in order to do the designing so dbms software user is also going to get to know so when you visit any of the saree centers and all they will give you the catalog instead of showing what and all the sarees we have so if you see that catalog all those contents are available in the background so that this catalog can be used by the dbms software and also by the database user who need the information about the database structure so if your dbms software or software Engineers so whenever they wanted to make a changes to this database at the time they must know what we have in our database what does its structure what are the constraints set of rules and regulation we have so in order to hold all those information here we have our database catalog with the help of this metadata or a database catalog we can get the benefit or we will get to know the structure and its whatever the schema along with the constraint we have this is what the first characteristics that is self-describing nature of a database system next we'll see insulation between the programs and data that means if you are doing some changes to the first floor that should not affect on the second floor that is what we have is a program data Independence and program operation Independence so you can see here if you consider the file system so we have a files here and in order to access this file we have a application program if I am doing any changes to this database file then that content of this database file we're going to affect on the application program that is in the file system but if you consider the database so here I have a data files or it is going to include certain information so in order to access this data file I require one application program if I am doing any changes or if you are doing or modifying any of the content in the database file data file at the time this data file changes or manipulation will not going to affect on the content of this application program why because we are not at all going to make any changes to this application program in order to access the content of this data file that is what we are calling this as a program data Independence data is independent and program is independent if something going changes with the data file that will not going to affect on the program so that the structure of a data files is stored in the dbms catalog separately so here you can see that we have our data files the data file will going to be stored in the dbms catalog separately that data file is separate here and in order to access that we have our application program that is separate so that there is no what interdependence between these two then we are calling that as a program data independent separately from accessing program so if you are doing any changes to the data files that will not at all going to change or it will not going to affect any content of this access program that is what the reason we are considering dbms is somehow more efficient than the file system then what about this program operation Independence so we have a operation that is set of task is taking place so when it comes to the operation that comprises of two types of the things will be there mainly it is going to include the interface as well as implementation if I consider the operation that comprises of interface and implementation so this interface shows that how we are going to interact with the system and this implementation shows that what is the programming language that we are using but when it comes to this operation program Independence so that the operation specified in the two pass as I told earlier that comprises of interface and implementation that interface is different and implementation is different so that both are not at all going to be dependent on each other so if you are doing some changes to the interface that will not going to affect on the content of its implementation so that when it comes to the interface that includes the operation name and data types of its argument it's like a function we are sending what is the name of an operation for example if I am doing addition or a sum that is the name of an operation and data types am I doing a operation with integer float number or Boolean number that and all I'm going to specify that is comes under what interface then what about this implementation can be changed without affecting the interface we can change the program or we can change the operation or implementation without affecting this interface then we are calling this best nature as what program operation Independence so this is how it is making a more difference than any other file system next we'll see about this data abstraction so we all know how to use washing machine how to use WhatsApp but do we really know how it is taking place internally or how it is working internally somehow that is no right that is what we call this as a abstraction it is showing only the essential part by suppressing the background details then we call that feature as a data abstraction as I take on the example of bookmyshow so we all know or we will get to know what are the number of vacancies we have what are the number of field seeds we have but we we won't get to know who is the user one who got it booked that we don't know that means you are data abstraction it is providing or producing only the essential feature by hiding its background detail even that feature is also there in the database management system so whenever we have this program data Independence and program operation Independence together we call this as what data abstraction so that and also we have a conceptual representation of a data it won't include the details of how data is stored or how operations are implemented so here you need to concentrate how data is stored and how operations are implemented but we all know how to get the benefit from those data as well as the operation then we calling that as a data abstraction and also we have a data models here that we're going to specify the type of data abstraction that is used to provide the conceptual representation this data model represents the scheme or that represents the concept which we are using in order to provide this data abstraction to the database system this is also one of the characteristics next what we have it supports the multiple views of the data for example let me take a example of WhatsApp if you consider the WhatsApp group if you are the admin of that group the interface for you is going to be different if I am a participant then my interface of that particular group is different if you are admin then you can make a someone as admin you can remove them you can add some participant that and all the option that you are going to get if there is no multiple views of a data then that wouldn't be able to do that then that feature is also there in this data base so that it is going to support multiple views of the database we have a different number of user that I will be discussing in the coming slides we have a different people which is associated with the database files database system so every people or every actors on the scene behind the scene or every user of the database should get their own kind of interface they should have their own view of the data if I am a database administrator for me the database somehow looks different if I am the end user then I won't bother about how it got implemented what is the data we have instead of that I will just focus this on how to get the details from it how to get the benefit from that that means what we have a multiple user for every user this database will going to look different so that that we can have with the multiple views with the help of this view concept then what about view here it is a subset of the database and moreover it will going to contain the virtual data which is derived from the database file but it is not explicitly stored you will get to know how to access it or how to get the benefit but it won't showcase us when the data goes stored how the operation is taking place moreover it is a subset of database and also we have a multi-user dbms so user may have variety of distinct application must provide a facility for defining a multiple views then only we can have a multi-user and multi-views of the database we'll see the next feature here the test sharing of data and multi-users transaction processing so sharing of data if we don't have our ability to share the data from one system to another system or from one user to another user then it is of no use if if you are all using Whatsapp if it isn't containing any of the sharing of images videos audios and all then we won't going to use that and also if you take the example of bookmyshow if you are trying to book some of the tickets at the same time even if another people is trying to book a tickets will it going to say for no for everyone no right if you are also trying to book a tickets even some other people also trying to book a ticket then there will be no issues in between then we call that as what multi-user data processing system so that it is going to allows multiple users to access the database at the same time we if you are all trying to book a train ticket by making use of some tatkal and all it's not at all going to say no for some other people instead of one people so that overall the users or who are the multiple user we have everyone have a ability or it is going to allow us to do the accessing of a database at the same time okay then we are calling that as a concurrency in order to have a efficient usage of a accessing of a content of a database then the maintenance and controlling of that concurrency is also going to be important so that we have a concurrency control software that is controlling the multiple users access there should not be any isolation one transaction should not affect the other transaction so in order to maintain all those things we have this control or concurrency control software mainly this ensures that several users trying to update the same data to do so on controlled manner so if it is getting deducted for example you just imagine we have two clerks in a bank so if one clerk is deducted amount from your account something you have withdrawn from your account let me consider 2000 you had five thousand now it needs to be three thousand fine so if clock one is deducting two thousand from your account another clock 2 should not do the same thing so if she's all or he is also doing the same thing then another 2000 will going to be deducted from your account so that whenever we have a multiple users accessing to the database at the time they must ensures that only one transaction should takes place so that updation if all are trying to update the same data then that should be in the control manner if it is done by one club that should not be able to do the same thing for another club at the same time for the same transaction and also it is result of the update it's correct and next what we have it should provide a online transaction processing application so with the help of this feature we are all able to do the transaction over the online fine these are the characteristics and purpose we have in the database approach so here you can see the advantages it will going to control the database redundancy it won't allow you to have a duplicate data and then we have a data sharing data can be shared over the internet and easy maintenance it is also going to reduce the time of processing so if it is taking one hour or two R in order to reach a message from one person to another person somehow it is difficult if you are trying to book a movie for a 10 AM show if it is getting booked by 11 o'clock then somehow it is useless so that it is going to reduce the operational time and also we have a backup option here that means it is providing a protection as well as security to our data and also it is providing multiple user interface these are the advantages we can get with the help of this dbms fine the cotton know what is data what is database management system what is information what is dbms as well as database and also we will get to know what are the characteristics and purpose we have in our database approach along with application and now we got to know advantages next we'll see who are all the people associated with a database system that means we're all using this database when it comes to that first here we have a database administrator these are admin it's a person one who is going to have a control over all the database so if you don't have a control over the database everybody can access the content everybody can manipulate the content so that allowing only the authenticated user genuine User it's in the hand of this database administrator so that's dbms is a person who has central control over both data as well as the application we must also have a control between the data as well as the application that is going to be done by this database administrator in short it is a dbm I see some of the responsibilities of this DBA that is authorization access only the genuine user those who have its ID as well as password only those those people should access the content and schema definition and modification so if it is in the hand of everybody in order to change the scheme or a structure of database then there is no consistency of data that schema definition and its modification it's going to be done only by this database administrator and also new software installation and security enforcement and administrator all these responsibilities in the hand of this database administrator whether you wanted to create a table database or any of the view reports everything you you should be authenticated user then only it is going to allow us to do and coordinating and monitoring of a database acquiring the software and Hardware resources if it is necessary only the resources will going to be allocated for the end user that allocation and deallocation and coordinating and controlling of all the databases it's going to be done by the responsibility of this database administrator next who is that people we have a system under list if I wanted to create a database then I should understand right then I should analyze what is the problem what user is seeking for then that analysis will going to be done by this system analyst they are going to determine the requirements of end user if they don't know or if my purpose is for bank or five education purpose if they don't know my requirements then they won't be able to create a database so that in order to do the analysis why this end user require this database in order to do that analysis we have a system analyst here so mainly to create a solution for their business needs and focuses on the non-technical as well as the technical aspects if you are a normal end user then we won't know or we won't be able to get to know what this Technical and non-technical aspects so then there must be some people know in order to analyze the data and in order to understand what is our need and requirements so in order to have that we have a system analyst here once it got analyzed then that needs to be designed by designer if it got designed then that should be comes as a working procedure model so in order to make it work then we have this application programmers they also considered as a software Engineers here these are the computer professionals who implement the specification given by the system analyst as well as develop the application program whatever the schema which is given by this analysis by analyzing the requirement of a end user we have a programmers or a computer profane a professionals they are going to make that model work by writing a program so that they are going to develop a application program and also they are going to test debug document and maintain the canned transaction the scan transaction is meant for a particular purpose so they have to do the testings there should be no errors or no bug if there is error then they should do the debugging and also they should do the documentation as well as the maintenance of all those transaction by writing the program that is going to be done by this system application programmer next who we have that is database designer analyst we're going to analyze what is the need after analyzing the need that needs to be designed that is what going to be done by this database designer is responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database for choosing the structure to represent and to show the data so they mainly what they are going to do they are thinking about the structure or they are thinking about the backbone of a system or skeleton representation of a database so they are going to identify by the data which needs to be stored in a database by choosing what is the structure which structure is appropriate in order to store the data all those will going to be designed by database designer and they are interact with each potential group of user and develop the views of the database that meets the data and processing requirements of these group main thing is what we have a database I have something in my mind that can be what bank data database or educational sector database what a meter building whatever could be the database first what we are I should go with a system analyst they are going to do the analysis they think about what and all the requirements after analyst given the document this database designer so database analyst will going to do this after that Designer will going to design what must be the structure of a data how we are going to show the data here so all these will going to be done by the designer so once they got the water blueprint after that we have a programmer programmer we're going to do the coding so they are going to to use some of the programming languages in order to do the coding so what are they are doing whether doing it properly or not so allocating of your resources or not what a technical and non-technical aspects everything will going to be controlled and managed by The Mastermind then we call that as a database administrator once it got developed then we have a end user those are all the people one who is getting a benefit from this database management system okay so these are the people who we associated with this database system next what we have here end user as I told earlier here we have an end user the person one who is getting a benefit from this database analyst will has a analyzed designer will do the designer and application program where we're doing the programming in order to maintain that we have administrator by integrating all these we have an end user at last we are getting a benefit from it that means the user who are interact with a database in order to query and update the database and regenerate the report for our sake we are writing a query and we are updating the database in order to get a benefit from it then who are all the types of end users we have here you can see that we have a casual end user we have an A or parametric end user sophisticated end user and Standalone end user we'll see each type one by one when it comes to the Casual end users as the name suggests they use the database occasionally when they need it but for every time their need will going to be different than the other need for example sometime I may use the train reservation system that is one database so some other time I may use airplane booking or Airlines and sometime I may go with a movie tickets booking that is what I will be considered as what casual end user I'm accessing the database occasionally whenever I require but every time my purpose will going to be different so that is casual end user next we have a name or parametric end user they already they are using a same database operation regularly you can take the example of Bank logs they are using the same database application every day in order to do the same transaction so that they use a previously well defined function in the form of can transaction against the database we call that as a can transaction they are using it on the regular basis so you can take the example of Bank and tell us a reservation class so we're all accessing the same content same operation they are doing can transaction they are doing regularly then we call that as a name or parametric end user next what we have sophisticated end user one who know the in and out of a database being an end user I don't know how it is working internally I am just trying to get the benefit I'm accessing only the external view or external content but when it comes to the sophisticated user all the analyst designer application programmer software Engineers all these people comes under this category so that if you wanted to use any of the intelligent system then we require a sophisticated user that means you should know the knowledge or you should have the knowledge of in and out of a system then we call that kind of people as what sophisticated end user this includes the business analyst and also scientists engineers and who the role is familiar with the system capabilities then we call them as a sophisticated end user and they are going to use tools in the form of software packages that work closely with the stored database but being an end user or being a casual end user we don't have a accessibility to this store database but that can be work for this sophisticated end user then who we had as last that is Standalone end user so here mainly Standalone comes for what maintenance Personnel the Personnel or a set of people one who is maintaining a database then we call that as a standalone database using ready to use Mac application so you can take the example of tax program user they are going to create their own internal database so in that situation we call them as a standalone these are all the people one who working on the screen or actors on the screen then who are all the people walking behind the screen then we have these many people here database system designer and implementer and also we have a tool developer in order to design and implement the tool which we required for can transaction and operators and maintenance Personnel one who is keep on maintaining the database that responsible for running and maintenance of a database then we call those people as what operators and maintenance Personnel they are all these are all the people one who is working in a background I hope you all understood my today's session in our coming session we'll see what about this data model what are the different data models we have then what do you mean by database schema and we'll see how this database architecture look like along with each layer let me meet you there until that keep learning keep on growing thank you

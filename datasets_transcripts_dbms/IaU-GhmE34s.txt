in this video we are going to discuss about keys in er model that is case in dbms let us take this table here name of the table is student student table mainly contains four columns rule number name email and marks and these are called as attributes or this can also be called as fields also so the values which we entered in the table is called as attributes or fields so roll number is attribute one is attribute ramesh is attribute 95 is attribute everything is attribute variasa this is a rope this is a row row row here each row of your table is called as some row this is nothing but column or record or we can call as tuple tuple okay now let us see what is a key key means an attribute it may be a single attribute or a collection of attribute key is an attribute or a collection of attributes collection of attributes which can be used which can be used for unique identification of for unique identification of each tuple in a table so what is a key key means an attribute it may be single attribute or a collection of attributes so more than one attribute so what is the purpose of key which can be used for unique identification of each table each tuple in the table tuple means row for unique identification of each row in a table so by using key we can we can identify the corresponding row so here let us assume that rule number is the key if rule number is the key then by using the rule number we can identify that row so this is the this row is the details of rule number one this row is the details of row number two this row is the details of rule number three why because here key means it is unique value it should not accept any null value if you take rule number rule number cannot accept duplicate value so here we can't enter one here why because this is key so key means it is useful for unique identification of that row so it should not accept any duplicate value repeated values are not allowed so we can make rule number as the key but can we make name as the key no why because multiple students may have the same name so here the names are ramesh naresh mahesh nares in place of naresh let us assume that the name is ramesh so two students have the same name ramesh ramesh so name can't be a key field name can't be a key field next next can we make email yes keep yes we can make email as the key why because multi same email can't be provided to multiple persons okay so we can use email as the key next mox can we use boxy as the key no we can't use mocks as the key why because multiple students may get same marks in the examination so here what are the key fields rule number is the key field as well as email is the key field various name and marks are non key fields okay so what is the purpose of a key key is mainly useful for unique identification of each row in the table so by using this email are you at the rate gmail.com so we can identify that this is the information about this email this is the information about this email like that okay so this is about the purpose of yaki it is mainly useful for unique identification of each row in your table in er model mainly we use three keys the first key is super key super key the second key is candidate key candidate key third key is primary key in er model mainly we use these three keys so first let us see the first key that is super key the definition for the super key is similar to key od so the definition for the super key is super key means it is an attribute or a collection of it is an attribute or a collection of attributes that can be used for unique identification of is to pull or row in a table so super key means it may contain either a single attribute or multiple attributes also so if you take this example rule number is the super key why because by using the rule number we can uniquely identify each row in a table so likewise email is the super key by using email we can uniquely identify each row in a table but name cannot be super key mocks cannot be super key why because by using name unmarks we can't uniquely identify the row multiple students may have the same name and multiple students may get the same box but here super key means uh it can accept a collection of attributes also collection of attributes also so rule number plus name so this is the super key so by using rule number and name we can uniquely identify the information so one ramesh so one ramesh means this is the details of roll number one ramesh let the second person student name is also rummaged but here what is the first field two so here this row provides information about the rule number two whose name is ramesh so there is some difference here rule number one ramesh information rule number 2 rubbish information like that or we can use we can use email plus mox as the super key or we can use rule number plus name plus name plus email as the super key so by using rule number name and email we can uniquely identify that row or we can use roll number plus name plus name plus email plus mox as the super key but can we use name place marks as the super key can we use name plus moxie as key key now let us see about candidate key what is a candidate key candidate key means a minimal sub a minimal subset of the super key candidate key means minimal subset of super key minimal subset of super key that can be used for same purpose that can be used for that can be used for unique identification same purpose unique identification of each tuple in your table of each tuple in your table so here candidate key means minimal subset of the super key so here candidate key means it should contain minimum attributes it should contain minimum attributes now let us consider these examples whether these are can whether these are candidate keys or not if you consider rule number yeah there is no problem rule number is a candidate key why because by using the rule number we can uniquely identify the corresponding tuple and here we have only one attribute so one attribute means it must be candidate key next email email is also a candidate key but name unmarks name and mocks are not candidate keys why because name is a non key as well as mox is a non key they accept duplicate values so name is not a candidate key mox is not a candidate key okay next rule number and name is rule number plus name rule number and name combination is it a candidate key is it a candidate key it is not a candidate key why because here rule number plus name means here we have two attributes already we have only one attribute as the candidate key okay so this is nothing but subset of rule number plus name only here we have roll number so we can say that this is not a candidate key why because here the key has how many attributes here we have two attributes but already we have one attribute which is a candidate key so likewise this is also not a candidate key why because here we have two attributes are there here if you consider this one we have three attributes already we have candidate key with one attribute if we consider this one here we have four attributes but already we have a candidate key with one attribute so the first two are candid key whereas these are not candidate keys okay now let us see the last one that is a primary key one candidate key is selected as the primary key so candidate key means what primary key means what one candidate key one candidate key will be selected as the primary key here we have what are the candidate keys room number and email are the candidate keys okay so out of roll number and email so one key will be selected as the primary key okay one key will be selected as the primary key and two conditions for the primary key are primary key should be unique primary key should be unique so that means it should not accept any duplicate value and the second condition is primary key is not null that means we here here we didn't enter any value but that is not accepted primary key means we have to enter some value we have to enter some value if we don't enter some value then we will get some error messages so this is about what is primary key so primary key means candidate key only so one candidate key should be selected as the primary key and it has to satisfy two conditions primary key should be unique as well as it should be not none not none so that means we have to enter some value so this is about uh he's in er model so this is about case in database management system

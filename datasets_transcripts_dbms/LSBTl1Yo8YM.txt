dive into the world of rdbms with Eads the map of your data Universe this segment illuminates how these diagrams detail the relationships within your business's database clear concise and connected witness how one salary account relates to one employee and how roles Interlink employees join visha to master erds and prepare to transform your data into an orchestrated network of information let's begin this visual journey in into the structure of your data efficient insightful essential it's time to design your data's future starting now so throughout this we have talked about you know relational database management system and we have emphasized enough on the word called relation what we understand from that is that anything that we are trying to store the different entities the different tables they're actually somehow related to each other now there can be different kind of relationship like you know there is a one way relationship or there will be a two-way relationship there can be one to many or there be many to one right so there are different possibilities of relationships and when we decide or design any kind of schema at the time of the designing itself we decide on that how two entities will be dependent on each other right and before deling you know inserting start inserting data into it we try to bring up a plan a kind of you know a kind of diagrammatic representation of how how the different relations the different entities and the different tables will be interacting among each other so this is how we do with the help of the entity relationship diagram or the erds so erds are basically the visual representation of the different tables the different entities that you have decided to you know to construct in your database design and it also shows that how the different entities are interacting with each other now if we talk about the different kind of interactions there can be multiple kind of interaction on a high level they can be like 1 2 one it can be one to many and just a mirror image of the second point it can be many to one and we can also have like many to many kind of relationships let's try to take an example that you can see on the screen to understand all these three four kind of relationship like one to one one to many many to one and many to many so right now we have you know uh four entities we have defined one is our employee the another entity that we have is related to about which department a particular employee can be the third entity is the salary and the fourth entity is talks about you know what kind of role a given employee will perform or what what kind of role he's expected to do right if you've made it this far in the video give us a like a share subscribe hit the Bell icon tell

powered by upgrad in collaboration with experts from meta minra and Linkedin over 20,000 working professionals from over 6 65 batches have already done this course now back to the video so let's first talk about relationship between the employee and a department right so we have a two tables right now one is related to the employee which has two field like employee ID and the employee name and another table is talks about Department which is Department ID and Department name now if we try to figure out the relationship between the employee and the department we can easily make it out that you know every employee will have at least will have at least you know zero or one department but a department can have multiple employees so if I have to see from the left to right this is you know this is many to one mapping because like multiple employees from this table can be a part of single department but if you look from the direction from the right to left there is one to many mapping like one Department can have the multiple employees right so if you try to find a relationship between the employee table and a department table we can figure it out that you know it is a uh one to many mapping when we we are moving when we are talking from the Department to towards the employee but it is many to one mapping when we're trying to see from the employee side towards the department side so this is how we diagrammatically represent this thing which is showing you know many employees are a part of the you know same department and it can be a value zero or one we have taken the value of zero for example if the employee is just getting inducted and the department has yet not finalized so in that case a employee will have a no record for the department but once he is properly inducted and he has been assigning a department the value can be at most one so this is a representation of one to many and many to one relationship so we have covered one to many and the many to one now let's try to talk about one to one so as soon as an employee gets inducted in the company uh their salary accounts get provisioned right and their account numbers are also created so that the salary gets created so for every employee they will have a unique salary ID and the account number and for every salary ID there will be only a unique employee ID and the employee number so if you try to figure out the relationship between the employee as well as the salary ID we can figure it out it is a one one kind of mapping so this is what is the meaning of oneone kind of relationship so we have covered that also and then there are certain scenarios where there's a many to many mapping right so for example in this case itself so we have a table called employee and we have a table called Ro so once you join a firm uh you may be expected to perform in the different roles right so for example you can be a mentor for someone you can be a individual contributor you can participate in some kind of fun activities right so the same employee can work in the capacity of the different roles this is one thing and similarly for one given role right for a one given role of say Mentor there can be multiple you know employees who are doing the Performing the same roles so if I have to find the relationship between the employee ID and the role I see there's a you know many to many relationships and this is the you know how we diagrammatically represent a many to many relationship between the two entities in a rdbms world so this is all about entity relationship diagram we have saw that what are the different kind of relationships possible and how we diagrammatically depict that we'll try to you know understand more better when we'll be taking you know the demonstration sessions in which we'll be understanding our schema where we'll be running our SQL queries and this is all about inded relationship diagram eids are a vital tool for understanding and organizing data

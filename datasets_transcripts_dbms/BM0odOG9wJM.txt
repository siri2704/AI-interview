hi guys and welcome to my new blog post blog post aid and in this blog post i'm going to discuss about entity relational model so let's start so basically when we talk about entity relation model basically er model basically defines the conceptual view of a database it works around like real world entities and the associations among them at view level the ear model is basically considered a good option for designing database so you need to look at your surroundings for the entities and then you need to associate those entities with each other because they will have some kind of relationship so when we we are talking about entity relationship uh model we need to talk about entities first so let's move towards entity so what basically entity is so basically by definition an entity can be a real world object either animate or in animated uh that can be easily identifiable and identifiable for example there's a school database and students teacher classes and courses offered can be considered as entities right and all these entities have some attributes or properties that give them that kind of like their personal identity and entity set is basically a collection of a similar types of entity and entities that may contain entities with attribute sharing similar values for example student set may contain all the students of a school likewise a teacher's sect may contain all the teachers of a school from all facilities so entity sets needs sets need not be disjoint by this means like when we are talking about like students so it is quite possible like you are creating a separate entity as a student so students table could be a student could be us a separate table as well as if you identify teachers as separate identities so teachers can another can be also another table within database so this is the basic real small conceptualized concept of entity coming towards attributes so basically when we talk about attributes these are basically entities are basically represented by means of their properties and these properties are called attributes all attributes have some kind of value in them and for example when we talk about attributes a student entity may have a name class age the the courses that he actually studies uh attendance and things like that so there there exists a certain domain or range of values that can be assigned to attributes for example a student name cannot be a numeric value you can't name a person like one two three four five six and it has to be alphabetic uh for example ahmad or something like that and likewise when we talk about students age it cannot be negative it should always be a positive number it should be greater than uh 1 greater than or equal to one so when we talk about attributes there are multiple types of attributes that we talk about so first attribute which is being shown on the uh slide is simple attribute so what does that mean so it means that simple attributes are basically just atomic values which cannot be divided further and for example when we talk about a student's phone number it's basically an atomic value it has certain digits and they cannot be more sliced in order to get the information next one is composite attribute so composite attribute is basically a concatenation of two or more simple attributes so composite attributes are basically made of more than one simple attribute for example a student name may have first and last name so ahmad and mohammed is basically these are basically first these could be first and the last name of two uh of one person's name so when i actually concatenate them or like combine them i will get a composite attribute which could be ahmad muhammad so next one is basically drive attribute so driver attributes are basically the attributes that actually do not exist in the physical database they are actually not in the file but logically they can be extracted so you can actually drive their values from actually other attributes that are actually present in the database for example you can actually talk about like what is the average salary rate in a certain department what is the average age factor in a particular class and you don't need to save this kind of information in the database directly instead you need to store granular information like salary of individual person and salary of sorry ages of uh students in that database right another example could be like you need to get the age from date of birth like if you know the month date and year uh of a certain person which is actually date of birth so you can extract out that they the age of that certain person next comes the single value at single value attributes so single value attributes mean like it contains a single value uh for example social security number or national identification number but it can be or cannot be a simple attribute because uh like a simple attribute will always be a single value attribute but single value attribute it doesn't necessarily means like it it could be uh it it could be it could be possible like it is not a simple attribute for example uh when we talk about national identification numbers so that can be broken down into multiple meaningful uh slices like you can actually get the pretty good idea about like by looking into the national identification number you can actually get pretty good idea about like what is the location of that person last thing is multi-value attribute so multi-value attributes actually may contain more than one values so for example a person can have more than one one phone number email addresses home addresses he may choose multiple courses a student may choose multiple courses teacher is teaching multiple classes so there these are actually multiple value attributes that that can be assigned to a certain entity so these types can actually be combined together as well like you can combine simple attribute with the single value attribute and simple value with multi-valued attributes you can also use like composite attribute with single value attributes and compute composite with multi-valued attributes so this is a pretty much simple idea about the entity and respective attributes so in next uh blog i'm going to discuss about the relationships we have already discussed about relationships in another video but i will repeat that again so i have i hope that you have got the concept of the idea uh idea of the entity relational model so please do not forget to subscribe like and share my youtube channel yasif fazel and please do

so this is introductory video in which we are going to discuss what's database why we need database and what are different languages which helps to show data and database so today we are producing a lot of data and we can see that on our website known as internet livestreams this is the on this website we can see these are the google searches that are done by people only today the tweets sent today the blog post written today so all these are the data that's produced by us the users so to manage this data we need uh databases so that we can store that data and the databases can be you know very difficult to decide in which database we should store our data to there's a a lot more options for databases like mysql mongodb redis and many others as well but to understand that what database to use or what query language to use based on our requirements uh we'll be able to understand it after this video and so let's start so in databases we have two types of query languages that is sql and nosql where sql stands for structured query language and nosql stands for non-structured query language so as per the name we can understand that sql is used to store structured data known sql is used to store non-structured data so sql is a language that is used by relational databases like mysql and nosql is the query language that's used by the databases like mongodb already so there could be many other databases and but i have mentioned these only and in sql or the mysql server to store data we use tables to show data in form of tables so table structure is required to store data in my skill databases and in no sql servers or the databases the that uses nosql as the language there we can store data in form of a document in document structure we can show data sql servers or the databases requires a schema or structure predefined we should know all the columns that we need to store our data whereas in the case of nosql it's more flexible to changes like there's no such uh point that you have to store data in form of tables or anything else we can show data based on our requirement and sql is very great with managing deletions because the data is stored in form of tables so we do not have to care much about the relations but in nosql when the data is very big it's very complex to manage relationships in nosql as compared to sql sql is very mature language whereas the nosql is very new and shiny and sql is costly because it requires more infrastructure and you know we need to have free knowledge about what we are going to store to define the structure whereas in no sql it is easier to scale according to our requirement where we can use sql is many big forms are using sql to store the data because they are not the data if they need to store they have predefined structures whereas in for in case of nosql uh any fresh startup can use nosql as their database language because it is very easier to scale based on our requirement we can scale it up or down and it's very easy and very flexible to change this because when we are new we do not know much about how we are going to store data where we are what data we are going to show so in that case no sql is much beneficial as compared to sql so that's it thank you so much

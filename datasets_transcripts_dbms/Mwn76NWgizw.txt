hello everyone in this video I will discuss about entity relationship model above we have already discussed about record-based de data models record based data models are you know of a divided into three or there are three record based data models that is hierarchical model Network model and relational model so we have already discussed about record based data models in my previous video so there is another type of data model that is based on object that is object to base the data models objective based data models oh no Arnold real real world in DT syllabus additive LA data model saniana objective based a data model snow/rain other real world alula entities in a model JM 1d you say no hana ii ii type models okay so object based or data model so the angle now on another entity relationship model and object oriented model object oriented narendra model a piranha okay so there are two objective based data models I have already discussed the code base data model so in this video I will discuss about NDT relationship model okay so a little pee really then in the ER model no or another ETA represents word entity and relationship okay so ER model is a model based on real world entities and relationships among them okay okay the real world entities in a b c d tularemia donna and it also represents the relationships among them vinamra partner foreign attendant on end it is new or novel word alexa stencil our god Sam hoger and the student-teacher reward some women are real world existential Alinghi physical existence India to them then you know for example bank account in physical existence India whether K on NDT sir ie and it is in a other entity in the middle of relationship pizarnik is now remodel on int relationship model okay so it is an object based model object based model navona for Iyengar no real world objects in your real world of Jackson Jana even a morally the other one is in the other entity relationship modeling or another object based model anima rangamma okay so it is used to do what formulating real-world scenario into the database model about database model like real world scenario nough introduces a an e real entity relationship model but remember and the ER model our entity relationship model creates entity set relationship set and general attributes and constraints our entity relationship with frame set together creating and the entity receptive relationships in the city general attribute in the city constraints in the city by the tender and all other you will understand okay so entity relationship model ER model is based on two things that is entities and relationships Abhaya are modeling entities named in the relationship anyway say they turn on a model constructed in other entities and it their attributes in DT sin and the noun for a properties in the Athenian homeland or a attributes annamaria relationship relationship to nor in the connection Anna okay so this is how we will represent any our model ER model EE reveal a number representing its sample either a triangle rectangle which is normally in DT well Carnac you were are in DTR never die rectangle which it occur on each other in your oval shape in dual alarm all our different attributes in a kadhai no these are what the attributes NDT one nearly attribute on entity to null attribute sana okay up ind Tina or another or objects honor student the teacher adorable object sana relationship in Warren and on either random objective ye object in the Manila connection Jana relationship on udesh in any or NDT key on the long different properties and our properties in your honor attribute a new leak in the okay so each entity will be having different different properties and these properties are called attributes and it is and varnish another real-world objects Ana relationship in Warren and honor and in dt Golota Molalla Shahana okay so now real world Andy Tiana in detail additionally having property is called attribute see entities in the property senior an attribute Anora another every attribute is defined by the set of values called a domain upper or attribute anymore the set of values in the other having the domain any animal domain no Maria okay see you but our example on over a hundred student college Rando on and the entities student is more in or NDT Anna's colon or another entity on any year student didn't different different attributes in the student into a attribute on a student ID student name student address any college an attribute on the college ID college name okay about your example student doom correlation tommelilla relationship on on the steady in when I'm a lover I'm student study in college Hawaii steady in an eleven on the relationship student correlational identities are on an e-card owner can run an attribute salmon okay other and I would have our own of the every attribute is defined by its set of values student ID no were an attribute another set of values in this student ID navarre myself Amanda Moodle through hundred over a hundred a variable evaluating your student ID student name unit set of values in the student ID trust not a set of values English a Madonna other student student they attributed net domain I the over our attributes in um domain in the domain or and then stock values that it it can access Elling even a permit is a list of values jnana attribute Anora another okay our attributes in of them down list of values and now a value senior any set of values in though a value senior and jnanam low domain of those values in marina above the school database on any student is considered as an indie t let student or NDT item will consider am student has various attributes like an ama is a classic sertraline student ID student name student address etc even a a Kiana NDT and para another okay so attributes either student ID student name student address in your model attribute on over I'm sorry okay any relationship sana relationship around on a logical association among entities is called relationship our under entities in student or an entity called Eisen or an entity with a Manilla Association logical connection or logical Association Jana a malindo area relationship in Oriya what a relationship item guevara another steady in the Nuala relationship common okay about sto relationship enamel appear immediately on America another NDT is rectangular no Eric another attribute to oval shape Allah Lilliana's numberless connecting of our economic okay about euro your entity relationship model little put together ya know to put take a diagram diagram Taniya on ER diagram Maria all right I'm gonna yahoo entity relationship model ER model illa database iconic am Wendy use in or a diagram on ER diagram econ amusingly picanha know this is an ER diagram either a ER diagram okay about year ER model other than the architecture diagram mundo and that diagram is called ER diagram so it is a graphical representation of the logical structure of the database database in the logical structure iconic una guru graphical representation on er ER diagram okay ER diagram or another graphically as a graphical representation Garnica no root diagram on a database in the diagram on a and here a year diagram forever loop rotate your future Bakula models long homily the rapid city line but they go to diagram design forum klappa say entity relationship model than the NIA vagrant okay over done in car number two student de navarra an entity class nor an entity lecturer subject malli entities on a little student doom class on the vanilla relationship on a student attends class la a student lecturer teacher student lecturer and the unity just student in a lecture room subject in the Molalla connection on a lecturer teaches subjects like classroom subjects in the vanilla connection on a class has subjects the subject has class we your be the dynamic on the amber tomb or a diagram or a combative our diet in your honor ER diagram or inaudible either example for a knee our diagram are they available and it is nothing the attributes in the student ID student name tr√©s class class ID level of our attributes in and then the attributes in him or all entities in and then the attributes in there okay so what are the advantages of your model it makes the requirement simply and easily understandable by representing symbol diagrams about database in the structure but tournaments lecomba to by using this diagram a diagrams of commutative but elements Latimer to Nirvana okay one can convert ER diagram into record based a data model easily any and then anomaly ER diagram I recognize a Lingam denahi are morally who say you know and then another one all ye are digressing a pertinent table sake converting between wanna as I'm here here diagram okie granule urea diagonal cuts on the table format lay convert am a tomb I don't know any anomaly our model elegir diagram but I cannot normally number of database design Ziemba atom ER diagram for heceta and Aden and the table later convert a our year diagram Tamir record based I to convert a and Johanna like it table select convert a and Sue Ghana okay so it is also easy to understand ER diagram I the ER diagram inshallah Mansilla kambou ec Anna you-know-who mechanic our overall database in the structure on the llama caiman is like a metal number okay so what are the disadvantages no standard and notations are available for ER diagram ER diagram under standard notation of them available Allah in the orang l ER diagram there is a greater flexibility in the notation Hawaii are digressing normally you see in IE notation synonym in the lower standard XS today in India and other flexible on a 3d element a pallet easily and easily you see in the natal depends upon the designer designer a dependent independent depending in the turn of the load okay I know do standard Alang Alang and it is meant for high level design high level program design in Montreuil the UCM Bertolo we cannot simplify or we cannot use it for low level design like coding lower level designs in a new yoyo diagram for the way usage aham Petula okay these are the disadvantages of ER model so that's all in this video thanks for watching

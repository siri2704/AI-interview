welcome to analytics with nags this is another 
video in the end-to-end series where i am going to   teach you structured query language that is sql i 
am going to teach a sql using microsoft sql server   this sql video is slightly different from my other 
end-to-end videos where i recorded dedicatedly   for youtube in all those entrant videos whereas 
this video some interaction like why i'm saying   this because this is not dedicatedly created 
for youtube instead i have given a training   to some people or my ex colleagues and some of 
my friends during the pandemic or lockdown time   and i have recorded it so this is slightly 
different from other end-to-end videos   but there won't be any compromise in the quality 
of the video or the content i hope you enjoy   this one as well so what are the topics you are 
going to see so i will discuss deeply in those   videos but to be understanding what things you 
will learn as part of this video i am sharing   this slide over here so you will understand about 
database why you need database and what is the   dbms sql server and what role sql plays in it then 
followed by all other topics related to sql only   so initially you will understand all these 
concepts then you will deep dive into sql language   so this is the main agenda of this video with 
this note let's move on to our code topic   and this channel contains inr 
75000 worth a thousand dollar   free content just utilize it as you can see from 
this playlist this is the analytics with log   playlist where you can able to learn ssis ssas 
altogether you can call it as microsoft bi   and also this channel is predominant having 
a power bi content as well and a lot of   people ask for career guidance whether the resume 
preparation how to crack the interviews or how to   move to these technologies so for 
them i've created career guidance   so please utilize this free contents 
as well let's begin our today's topic so it's all about data and you have any 
examples of data like whatever we use to store   is called your data it can be a customer 
information customer information in the   sense customer name customer phone number 
all those things are considered as your data   so this course is intend to have a database 
so database purpose is to store your data   okay so just going to a history why you 
need a database before inventing a database   what was there and what are the difficulties 
or disadvantages on storing the data before   the database what kind of system they used okay in 
that system what are the disadvantages they face   for this only they came up with the concept called 
database okay we will see that history first   so as i said you can see my screen you can see my screen guys yes we can see a screen see like um see you have a data right 
as i said the customer data   so earlier before the database 
invention doll how they have stored   they started storing using a file system say for 
example i can store this file as a customer info   okay so customer info so say for example i 
have a customer name and i have a phone number   something like that so name can be naga and my 
phone number can be 198674 something like this   and even i i no need to store in the same way like 
this i can store in the same way like this like   naga and 98765 my address can be 
in say for example i'm in koit   maybe someone else say for example varun this 
number is phone number is like this so i can   keep storing the data in this 
file system as well so this is how   the conventional storage of data has begun okay 
so when you keep storing the data like this data so when you have your data stored in a file 
system and what complexities arises like   windows have a restriction like 
you cannot have a storage of a file   more than 10 gb 5gb i'm not saying 
about today's high technology   i'm speaking uh 20 years back so they have a 
storage restriction of file individual file so they have a restriction we have a restriction 
of storage of a file okay so that is why you have the file system has other disadvantages 
over database okay now just a minute sorry guys i'm getting repeated calls okay let's 
continue so uh earlier they used to store the data   in the file system okay so you have a notepad 
or you can create a excel spreadsheet over here   you can keep storing the data 
in excel spreadsheet as also   so this is the file system you have and it's used 
to show the data it it also saves the same purpose   as i said database used to store your data and 
you you can even store the data in the file system   so what disadvantages that it had in typical 
file system that makes you to create your   database environment i mean that 
makes you to create meaning like that made you to evolve the database architecture 
okay so challenges what we face is like   uh size of your data as i said if it is for a 
small environment if you are managing for your   own purpose then it's fine if you assume as an 
organization you will keep on adding the files   you will keep on adding multiple files and you 
will as you see like you can't able to take the   backups you store it here and you put it in 
e drive you have drive someone asked you to   verify where it is you find very difficult 
so first is size hello someone is speaking okay so ease of updating so ease of updating 
means you can't able to easily update   say for example in the same file you have hundreds 
of customer the customer information has changed   he has changed the phone number you need to 
go on such assume you have multiple files   like that you have 80 to 90 files you don't 
know in which file the customer data is stored   so updating becomes very difficult storing is 
easy initially you start okay accuracy as a   these are more less related accuracy and 
updating everything is same and security   so when you have a data stored in the file 
system securing those files say for example   as a manager i need to access only the payroll 
i can access the payroll but the other employees   should not access the payroll information if i 
have all the information stored in my desktop like this this is your data and you 
have a payroll information over here   okay so you have payroll information so if this 
folder is accessed to everyone say for example   uh from the manager from the deal or your 
employees everybody can go and see their   payroll information how much they are paid 
uh what is the salary of my colleague what   is my manager's salary then that becomes 
unnecessary conclusion so that should be some   restriction to people who has to see what okay 
so security implementation is very complex here you can't switch between the screens hold on you can able to see guys i will teach 
you in this manner because switching   between the screens will become very difficult so 
security restriction is there and that makes us   life very difficult and redundancy 
redundancy as you see like um   you have the same data you what you feel like you 
feel very comfortable in taking backups you have   one copy in uh d drive and use copy and paste 
in either after some time you will not update in   e drive or ddr you can you keep on adding multiple 
backup sessions and whichever question you need to   use you don't know after some time so this 
redundancy of data and you will not have   accuracy this is a closely related and incomplete 
data so incomplete incompletion in the sense   uh you if that is like uh some constraints are not 
defined in your file system say for example your   employee or your customer should always have some 
phone number so that you can able to create if the   in a file system you do not impose an uh 
restriction to it without having a phone   number you can start creating it so those kind 
of incompleteness you will keep on adding that   becomes very complex when you have your data 
stored in your file data storage so this is the   main disadvantages that earlier systems phased our 
earlier organization phase so that it made us to   evolve and move towards the storing your data 
in your databases i think till this it's clear guys yes cool fine so coming to   the uh modules now with this note let us 
see what are the things we have in this session so basic database concepts so basic database concepts and we 
have a introduction to sql server   so these are the things i'm going 
to cover let's keep changing so introduction to sql ddl dml commands working 
with queries all these things will make you to   have a full sql developer that is sql server 
developer once you learn all these courses okay so i think rabbani rahil wants more on the 
module six two seven eight nine ten those   things so they are familiar with the module 
till first five modules i think let's see   this course will also cover the sql fundamental   about data querying yes this is that is what 
uh working with queries you have a module   6 over here hold on select select insert update 
and delete those and joins yeah yeah so you see   here working with queries uh aggregate functions 
joins uh you can see my mouse pointer there   yes yes so implementation of data integrity so 
basically it involves know about the database   and using sql okay i mean using sql and we use 
sql server as the dbms i'm going to quickly   start that session now that dbms all those things 
so this is your course content just go through it   okay because my job primarily to retrieve the data 
is on if anything needs to be updated or something   exactly so you learn all those things because sql 
means that is mandatory you need to create table   and updation querying coding is main 
path that comes with the dq okay okay we will see uh so i have a 
tool modules here i'm going to take   each module one hour and i will 
have another half an hour to uh   for i mean it will not completing one hour 
some classes will take uh more than one and   a half hours so that's what i told the 14 
hours session okay let's see how it goes okay give me a minute database management system so now i 
told you about database i mean data   we discuss about data uh anything any information 
is your data okay so it can be a customer   information it can be your transaction uh it can 
be your uh what to call the payroll information   employees and just use a mobile information 
emi number i mean imei number your mobile model   everything is a data okay anything any information 
uh definition of data is nothing but any useful   information is called your data and 
database that is used to store your data   that's all simple things okay and where this 
database management system comes into place   so if you read through the definition i 
think i'm not sharing the screen hold on so database management system if you go through 
the definition it says like it's a system   software for creating and managing your databases 
so first i started with data then i told what is a   database that is used to store your database 
then i am telling another term called dbms   so this dbms is nothing but that stays in between 
your database and your user so it's a software   that is used to collect the data and store it 
in our database it acts as interface so basic   logic behind database is nothing but 
database management system okay so   dbms makes it possible for end users to create 
read update and delete database in the database so   it's nothing but a software written it's a 
program that makes you to create the database   and modify the database so in general term 
you will say databases only but indirectly   the all the works done by database management 
system it's nothing but your software   so now i say like i am teaching this database 
course using a microsoft sql server so it is   one of the vendor that is microsoft is a vendor 
providing this software so sql server is your   database management system you got the point and 
oracle is your another database management system   and ibm db2 is your database management system 
underneath what will have you will have a   databases so databases is common okay that doesn't 
matter so ms sql server oracle all these things   are database management system i hope uh i'm clear 
in this point so how this database is architected   in the sense people will have a data okay so 
people has to insert a data in different ways   like uh this the user can use the client tools 
or uh hold on so user will either use the client   tools they will use the apis like application 
programming if you assume you are going for any   online shopping they will use to collect 
your information it can be a card details   or any online application so this api is nothing 
but this top screen is nothing but your screen   front-end screens okay using that they will 
gather the data then using the dbms software   they'll store their information in the dbms i 
mean database okay it can be a mobile application   and it can be a video or any other things so your 
data can be anything basically it is not only a   text it can be a image it can be a video those 
things also can be stored in the database okay okay so nagi uh one question here yes so this 
you said like ms sql server and oracle   uh so like in in the real-time scenario like 
who decides like what should be like mongodb   we have different uh dbms so yes yes so who 
decides which uh rdbms to go correct yes yes   yes so it's a business card basically if you have 
all your products built in microsoft they always   go for microsoft first sql server in some 
applications uh they used to go for oracle   so purely based on the uh business analyst or i 
would say architects so architects will decide   based on the volume each rdbms has its own 
advantages and disadvantages they need a parallel   processing they need multi-level tasking those 
kind of strings can be applicable only in   ms sql server oracle will not support that then 
they will obviously go for this so based on the   business scenarios situations they will go for 
each and even i would say rdbms i mean microsoft   sql server because i know that one i don't know 
about oracle this is a human mentality if you know   what i mean whatever you know you'll project 
it that's how it works most of the companies   as simple as that okay oh in my organization 
also uh they're using toad oracle yeah toad and   uh mysql is open source so it's uh i mean it's a 
free open source software so mysql you they will   not charge anything so that is rdbms that is 
i mean that is nothing but your dbms database   management system so this thing you need to be 
clear in mind okay so so the base concept will   be any difference the syntax or stay on the sql 
when you retrieve the queries or something when we   work on with sql microsoft sql and when you are 
going with oracle will there be any difference   uh the concept behind this is database is common 
for everything and they if they use sql structured   query language okay that is common for everywhere 
maybe the syntax may be different if you know the   programming languages like c or c plus any 
programming language it has its own syntax   declaring a variable like uh you mentioned 
the data type integer a or a comma integer   it differs between the programming language 
similar syntaxes will differ but they follow   the sql then the syntax will be same slight 
differences will be there in some cases   i would say in article and sql server we have 
80 percentage same syntax for most of the cases   there are some cases for providing access those 
things the syntax will differ even if you learn   this sql it will applicable for oracle and 
mysql everywhere you can use the same query okay okay so with that note let's move 
forward so now you understand what it is   microsoft sql server is nothing but your 
dbms and what it will do it will enable   you to create databases the databases 
will store data now the question arise   like when you have files okay you are storing any 
type whatever i typed uh earlier okay yeah i typed   in the notepad i can store it in excel like 
this or i can store it in a notepad like this move this window away so i can store uh anything 
like this i can store like this   i can store like this come 
on i need to fix this one what i'm saying is you see here i can store here 
in this format any other format so in case of   database how the data should be stored so you you 
got my point you can see my screen on it's pausing okay yes yeah one minute i i need to fix this guy i 
mean uh it's sharing share everything something   like that screen hold on now i hope it's 
fine i don't want to each time i am switching   it's asking me okay fine yeah yes sharp screen 
is fine now okay now you see like uh here you   have a customer name phone number i can store 
it like this i can store like this so that is   any way i can store if it is a file i can store 
like this also one one customer will store   i will say hurry and i will say like phone 
number here i am storing phone number here   uh after his name in this next line here i 
can store like this it's my wish there is no   restriction in the file system but the database 
perspective how you need to store the data   so there is a thumb rule like 
in dbms you need to store   the data in tables it's pretty much clear okay 
so the tables are nothing but your spreadsheets   you see here yeah so this is your spreadsheets 
are nothing but your tables if everyone i hope   everyone worked on excels so table is nothing but 
you have a rows you have a columns okay this is   how the data should be so in order to store your 
customer detail you need to define customer name   you need to define i mean you need to define 
this column column customer name phone number   and address okay this is the thumb rule where your 
data should be stored i mean how the data should   be shown so your data is stored in a table that is 
called your relational database management system   so i'm i told about uh database management 
system so there are different types of dvms   object oriented hierarchical no need to put much 
into it now the fold farmers everything is like   rdbms relational database management system where 
your datas are stored in a table pretty much clear okay now what is data field record database 
this is the hierarchy we need to follow data   as i said any information is your data field is 
nothing but your column each column is your field   technically speaking when a business perspective 
any application user will say it has a field okay   in database world it should be considered 
as column okay so it's a column then record   so record is nothing but you have defined the 
headers so i am having one record here nagi 98765 i'm just typing just a 
country name here in address   so each row one row is called your rector 
or i mean it's it's called a row in a table   or it's a record okay that is 
what you say it has a record then database okay so i i created 
this i i will name it as customer so   whether this is considered as a database 
no this entire thing is considered as a   table so this thing is considered 
as a table okay now i create another table like payroll here i can maintain another 
information so this is how the group of tables   so a database can contain multiple tables this may 
be i can say like entire excel sheet this single   excel sheet considers a database so this actual 
sheet is the database and can contain multiple   tables okay got it it is simple as that now with 
this all these informations okay let us quickly   know what is sql server all other stuffs like this come on so you you got now every idea about data database 
tables dbms okay as i said microsoft sql server   is your dbms rdbms relation 
database management system   so i have provided the link to you guys 
in the email i have sent you need to   install the softwares so that it will 
install microsoft sql server engine so the architecture comes like this okay i need to go back here say for example 
now i am saying about this two part let me hand it this two part okay database and 
dbms so whatever link i provided in the email   that will install your sql server only 
okay this alone the center part alone   it will install the second software 
maybe i will quickly show it to you guys i need to go to my so okay so this.net framework is uh forget about this 
there is no concept related to sql server all this   sql server built-in dotnet code so that is why 
microsoft asking you to install forget about this   this is not related to our topic then sql server 
see this link is nothing but your sql server as   a dbms it is nothing but your server the dbms 
software okay this is what you need to install download now as i said you if you 
have a 64-bit you choose this one   if you have 32-bit system you choose this one 
so this will these two will install your dbms   then what about this management studio it is 
nothing but your client tool to connect see server   is the software as i said it's a software just 
a software that will sit in your one desktop or   server system i mean any server dedicated server 
then you need a management studio to connect to   that server and you want to manipulate it create a 
database or you need to query it as you asked you   want to select a create tables whatever operations 
you do you need to have a client this is   management studio is nothing but your client 
okay so in this picture you don't have that   you assume this particular picture maybe i will 
say this one as your management studio so first   link will enable you to create the dbms next 
link management studio you need to create and   database or all other stuff okay so i 
will help you if you find a difficulty in   creating i mean installing now i already installed 
dbms database management studium that is nothing   but sql server i am trying to connect with your 
management studio at a client once you install it so we need to choose 64 or 86 according to system 
requirement right yes yes based on your system you   need to choose either of those i have selected 
four options you choose any two that's enough what are the two options right um just see i 
told you like here i mean x64 x86 you no need   to install both i mean download both check your 
system configuration in my computer like here yeah   okay whether it's a 32-bit 64-bit you choose 
in my case it's 64 i'll choose this one and   uh this one that's enough then click next and 
go for it 1gb only and uh praveen told uh he's   having 32-bit so he installs 86 this one as 
well as this one you need to choose these two   then go for it okay just download and install 
it uh by default options next next next then   you will get all the environments like this okay 
now this is the client as i told see this is my dbms i already installed it will go and sit 
you cannot see this one unless you have the client   just you have to connect the now this part uh 
like um this database won't exist only this one is   existing okay dbms software now you are connecting 
to the client then you are creating a database   then you create table inside it okay all these 
things you need to do manually once you install   the dbms it will not have database in place 
you are doing only the dbms at first place okay now already installed so this is my server name 
as i said this is the server you go to other   engines you forget about all those things server 
name i will give my server name then click on it so it is connected so this sql server 
management studio is your client   it's connected to your dbms that is sql 
server laptop this is the server name   and this will have all this architecture okay 
i mean we will go through it later now in order   to create database i already have some databases 
so in order to create databases one of the main   advantage of microsoft product is that you know 
minimal coding you don't need to write coding much   instead you can write i mean you can create using 
a gui so just right click on it new database i will say like um sql training let's fill in this wrong sql training corona fine so it's as simple as 
that just for the name these   file groups i will explain later just click on ok then you can see like sql training corona here 
okay these are database i already created so   once see this will contain the folder i mean 
uh databases inside this what we'll have   inside this only database under the database 
only you'll have tables views all those things   the disadvantages whatever we face in the file 
system like security and you have a consistency   i mean the user should not have restricted access 
those things can be implemented using these uh   options okay we will while going through the 
sessions we will you'll learn that one now so this   is the database uh you can create it like this or 
you can choose this one you can create a new query new query i'll say create database i'll say test2 something like that okay this is 
also way of creating it it is as simple as that so you have a test two here okay i don't want it just 
i want to show you guys how it has been created or   how it should be now we'll stick to this so how to 
navigate see once you have your database in place   okay here you choose that database then press new 
query okay so now you see this is highlighted here   i mean um let us have a spotlight you see uh 
highlighted here i mean sql training the database   then you can start writing it code now as i said 
uh you need to have the table to store the data so   as i said like here you have customer 
data so these are my customer data   so you cannot copy and paste and store 
it you need to create a table first   that table only stores the information 
okay so instead of wasting writing the   codes i already prepared some kind of 
scripts over here i mean module three okay so first as i said it's a customer 
information so this is the syntax for creating   your table so it starts with create statement 
and what you are you are going to create create   table customer customer id customer name and 
address so these are the things i want to store   so just imagine with the excel example 
these are nothing but your columns or fields   so you are just creating a metadata 
that is headers okay uh so that these   columns is going to hold those information okay 
this is the column name and what about this   these are very important part 
nothing but your data types so   any programming language or anything which have 
data type meaning what is the type of your data   say for example this customer id is set as 
integer int integer is nothing but numerical   values it will hold the values from 1 2 3 4 till 
some limits 3 million or some million it will hold   and customer name should be back here that 
is character it should not if you put integer   over here it will throw error in this case 
if i want to insert nagi it will not allow   so it is saying that restriction to your data 
what data it's going to hold that is your   data type type of your data you need 
to declare it there are number of data   types mostly we will use integer and worker we 
will go through it i will share you the link   there you can study what are the different 
types of data types and when to use this   when to avoid this what is the difference between 
valkyrie invest and we will go through it just   uh for now you focus on table this is the 
column names and these are the data types okay   now you see here i don't have any tables now it 
will by default it will have system tables once   i select this statement and do execute 
it has said completed successfully then   do a refresh here you find a table here okay this 
is the customer table now as i said how i can see   a data inside the table i cannot see like this i 
can see the columns what are the columns all those   things okay but i cannot have any data i mean i 
don't have any data it just creates the structure now you see uh this is the data customer 
id customer name customer address okay   so there is no data and how you want to store it wow i'll know the answers okay fine so basically 
you create a schema or a structure and you want   to insert the data this is the only way you can 
insert into a table i mean you need to explicitly   switch by insert into what is that object name 
that is object name is nothing but table then you   need to mention the columns so this is john and 
he's from london now when i select this statement okay now i go and see the data here so 
one customer information is stored so   this is how your data's are getting stored in 
the database it's flat i mean it's flat in the   sense it will be row row so this is called a row 
this is called a field this is called a field and   this is each cell is a data okay this is how it 
is related now let me insert some more values so that i can find something useful so now i have inserted two more records so 
this will have uh kumar abdullah bangalore   all those things so now you got a clear 
understanding about how you can store the   semicolon should we add 
semicolon at the end of the query should we add semicolon at the end of the 
query yeah as i said so it depends upon   each dbms rdbms in oracle you need to do in mysql 
you need to do what i studied when when i started   actually i was supposed to add a semicolon at the 
end of the world yes that's what i said so syntax go ahead go ahead come in but i i you did not add 
a semicolon at the end of the query yeah that's   what so as i said uh this sql is a standard i mean 
whatever i have written here is sql each and every   rdbms has its own syntax so in sql server there is 
no semicolon in mysql even in oracle i'm not sure   there might be a semicolon okay so there is no 
thumb rule so you need to focus on one particular   technology or querying or rdbms if you 
once you're familiar then you can compare   while learning i recommend you focus on this for 
now then you go for a comparison okay because   you already did a study on that that's fine 
i'm saying here in sql server no need okay okay guys so this is your about the table 
okay now let's focus on your syllabus so you see like the limitations of file management 
systems covered basic concepts and advantages   uh basic concepts is like a server client 
architecture what is data field record database   exploring relational database management system 
understanding client server so mostly this thing   this is history basic features 
components and tools yeah so you need to   uh starting and stopping these are very 
uh small things introduction to management   studio whatever i use this is the one types 
of system database in this field okay fine someone have any question someone or something 
okay just say once again the relational database   management yeah so you you now you somewhat you 
are familiar about dbmss it's a software now so   relational database management system is nothing 
but uh every table is a relation i mean the   to rephrase my sentence it's a software okay then 
what comes a relational database management system   you need to store a data in a relation 
manner so how it is relational manner if   you need to store it as a table so 
every table is a relation that is what   it's a relational database management system 
okay so how it is related let me explain with the   so basically dbms i explained now you see 
the customer heidi this london is related to   this id this london is not related to him so every 
table is a relation every column is specific to   this particular person it is not specific 
to this guy or this guy so this entire row   is called a relation they are building a relation 
so this entire table is called your relation okay not satisfied i think okay good good no 
no no i am saying there are other ways   of managing uh dbms object oriented hierarchical 
relational so they consider everything as object   hierarchical all those things now relational 
management system is nothing but purely   you need to store the data in a table that 
becomes your relational database management system   that's what the definition of it and every 
table is a relation that's the thumb rule okay now uh let me explain some more 
thing about um services so back to this   guy so this guy just sits as a 
service you see services dot mse you see here this is the guy sql server is 
nothing but your dbms database management system   that will run as a service this is running okay   now he is the one i mean uh we are 
running now when i stop it just see you run this query it will throw error should grow it's keep on running because it doesn't find the 
instance earlier see the connection is broken   and recovery is not possible okay 
so basically this is the server   and the service okay which is enabling you 
to run the management should i mean dbms   so this is the service you if there is 
some issues like this just go and check   the services connection is broken recovery 
is not possible something like that okay   let us start that so it is already 
running now when i go and run something   i instead of that i'll select this statement that 
will run immediately now it's working okay and   your management studio also will run as a service 
i think wait a minute microsoft sql not sure okay that is not as a service so this 
is your service and management should   as i said you can go and check it here sql server   this management studio this is your client tool 
that is what uh you want to understand using this   only you told about code is a client tool to 
connect your oracle so it's not a database   told uh i think if i'm not wrong veron can you 
tell me oracle you use toad or some other client toad i don't have much idea i heard about it yeah toad is a client tool to connect 
i think it's otherwise it's like uh ide   integrated development environment kind of thing 
so you can connect to server clients all of this   thing so it's a client tools okay it's a client 
basically so management studio is your client   and your sql services down on underneath okay 
so this is the things you need to know about then what system databases okay now see when i say like i connected this 
rdbms database management system when i right   click on it okay create new database it 
has created me a sql training database   with all the schema tables views 
synonyms all these things how it creates   basically this system database if you expand 
it this internally create a model database   master database msdb temp db all those system 
databases to process basically this model   will have the all the content to be created when i 
just create a name so this will create a one copy   this is taken as a copy then this database is 
created so already they have defined how it   should create all the metadata over here okay 
so just a copy and paste and renaming it to   whatever name we provide that is what your model 
database and this master information by default   all the data should be stored metadata if you 
see like what is my system configuration all   other stuffs okay this should be stored in some 
key database that is called your master database   and i'm not pretty much sure about it but tempdb 
whatever processing you are doing say for example   it requires uh say select 70 plus 80. okay i typed 
something wrong 70 plus 80 is 150 very easy answer   so i'm running this so 150 is your answer so this 
requires some computation some memory power to   calculate so those calculations will reside in 
your 10db so basically as a software it doesn't   do anything on its own all the things is doing 
using some kind of system databases okay so these   are the main purposes we will don't look much into 
it okay if you look into much into it you will get   confused we are never going to use that one just 
to for your understanding how they will create   all those things questions will arise for that i'm 
telling you forget about all these things you just   focus on your data and the history there is a 
disadvantages for using a file system that is why   we came to database and in database it is not just 
a database we have a database management system   underneath that will use it to create databases 
and all your and it is called relational database   management system and your data is stored in a 
table so this is the flow you should remember okay   uh i think today i can stop so 
these are the things i covered today   tomorrow i touch these things data types all 
those things we will look deep into what is your   data types ddl dml commands when to use 
this one create all other stuffs okay so in our previous session uh we have seen 
like what are the basic concepts of dbms   and why we need to go for databases and i have 
introduced sql server that is sql server is one of   the rdbms and we have seen sql server management 
studio how to create a database and all other   basic things like what is the data field record 
and we have seen uh module one and module two   and um so in today's uh session we will see the 
sql basics that is introduction to sql let's   see where this sql sits in this database world so 
basically we know that dbms database management   system is a software and we need to install 
and um we can access from the client systems   so this client systems either it can be from 
application or from client skills or management   studio or any apis should communicate to this dbms 
so sql is nothing but a structured query language   that is used to communicate to the database that 
is as simple as that as it says the language   any language is used for communication the sql 
is a language to communicate to the database   this is the definition of your skill so when you 
say uh it's a language then a sql consists of   um three kinds of comments basically they 
categorize the executable statements or   some kind of querying into three main categories 
there are other categories to kick start your sql   knowledge i think this is fair enough so what are 
the different types of statements we have ddl dq   and dml statements so what this will do assume 
the data definition language which is nothing but   use it to create the structure of the objects 
when i say objects it can be a table it can   be a view it can be a stored procedure functions 
those are considered as objects that are used to   create the structure and modify the structure 
that is your alter once you created a table   you want to include or exclude some columns 
in that case you need to go for alter   you want to remove the table or drop 
the table from the database then you   need to use draw so these are the different 
commands truncate used to clear the records   commands used to define the structure of the 
object that is why it is called ddr statements   and then dql once you created this should 
come second like data manipulation language   so as soon as you create the objects the data is 
not available you need to insert the records into   the created object or you need to add some content 
okay then you have to go for insert a record i   mean into insert the data into your tables that 
is what your data manipulation language what are   other operations you can do once you integrated 
you find like you some data to be modified then   you forgo for update some data to be deleted then 
delete statement to be used i will explain it   with some examples what are the different 
uh statements you can use once you inserted   everything is done and you want to see the 
data that is your querying so most of the   part you have to be familiar with select so it 
is not a single statement there are a lot of   other options in data coding like grouping 
where condition everything will come here   but basically everything comes under a single 
statement called select so these are fundamentals   of your sql data definition data manipulation 
language data query language let us see uh by   creating one table then i just want to explain 
the um some of the concept called data types   then we will go through all these statements one 
by one so the first statement i'm going to create   the structure okay i'm going to instruct what 
this statement this statement i'm explaining   so what i'm saying here is i'm instructing the uh 
database management system from my client that is   this my management studio is my client from 
the client system i am instructing the dbms   create the table so it has to understand right 
this is the syntax okay the any language has some   syntax and programming language i mean so this is 
the syntax to create your table which says like   create table and your name you can give any 
name either they have certain rules to give   a name you cannot have a space here so some rules 
are there okay so you need to follow those rules   and you need to provide the column name followed 
by the data type then this is the constraint   whether it's a null not null all 
those things i will cover it uh   later in later modules so to understand it 
this is the syntax create table table name   followed by column name and data 
type this is the second column name   and it's data type this is the third column 
name and it's data type okay so once you do this   okay now you can see i already have this 
table so let me drop this table delete it so i do not have this table right now okay 
the customer so when i say execute select the   statement and click on execute let me connect it 
command completed successfully so now you can go   here in your database sql training corona 
and refresh it so as soon as you do that   okay sorry see there is a issue here i i didn't 
create it in the sql training corona database   so you need to choose it first you choose this 
database and execute it that is created in the   master we need to delete it i can drop it later 
now i created in this database instead of this   okay you can use some class like use use if i 
want to create this table in naga store okay okay when i use this one it will 
automatically change it to nagastore   so first statement you need to use   that is use the database name that is the best 
practice let me change it to sql training corona   here also secure training corona let us keep like 
that so by mistake it will not uh you will not uh   create in a wrong database so this is fine 
now once you see and refresh it you can see   the table created and as soon as you create 
it okay there won't be any data available   you see what are the things it has created 
you mentioned only this now you can see what   are the columns available are created in this 
table then is there any constraints triggers   or keys you have created all those things 
will automatically fall under this table so   let us stop this i mean break for some time for 
creating uh this table or ddl and dml statements   what are different sql statement i want to cover 
the important topic like this integer and invarcat   or what is this data type is all about 
so i quickly try to insert one record   so this is how you need to insert a record 
and i can see the record here select star from the customer okay now you see here you have your 
customer id customer name customer address   right so in this you have uh something 
like um integer and inverter what are these   these are nothing but your data types which 
defines what data this column should hold   whether this column customer id is an integer 
or text columns or any other binary or numerical   column so those kind of what is the type of 
data you are going to store that is your data   type that is what you need to mention it here so 
what are different types of data types available   let us see it here i hope it is very small let me 
uh put it in a big screen so now you see like uh   basically most of the time exact number numeric 
you see here the first preference is like here   the bigint integer numeric small end all these 
things are used to store the numerical values   there is a limit for each and every data type 
i have given the link over here i will share it   in the description so you can watch that one so 
each data type has the limit if you want to store   uh big numbers okay it's more than uh trillion or 
some big numbers you cannot store it in integer   and if it is something between 0 to 128 numbers 
you can use the small end instead of using the   integer so based on your type of data as well 
as the volume how much data it is going to store   the limit okay minimum and maximum limit 
you can choose appropriate data types   so if it is like uh strings there is text 
there are three varieties i mean uh three types   character text var cap and inverter is a new 
data type that needs to be added then last is   i mean there are other kind of data like you have 
a date time here if your column going to store the   date related uh uh data then you can use date 
date time to small date time our time so based   on what what kind of data you're going to store 
so each uh what is the difference between date   date time and date time to we can uh check it 
later i mean basically uh this will have only   the date this will have a date time and this 
will have date time with some utc kind of thing   so based on your business scenario also you need 
to choose appropriate data types for the columns   so mostly we will use integer and in work and date 
time and there are certain things like you have boolean values right whether it is true or false 
you have a kind of binary zero and once so those   thing you can show it as a binary then you have 
uh it's not a binary i think this is for uh var   binary and images for big numbers right i mean 
you can store the image in this data type if   i i mean sql server can store the images in in 
a column so image how images uh will be stored   using this data type when you store it in web 
binary you can retrieve it okay that is what so   there are some special data types also there xml 
spatial geography types so these are some special   character i mean data types that you can use uh 
here you see the character string worker and you   see the unique code character string inverter so 
what the differs from onion n stands for unicode   and which is basically nothing but uh unicode 
characters are multilingual like these will store   only the ascii characters or only alphabetical 
characters in only english language you can say   and whereas the unicode characters will 
support the other languages like um   chinese language or arabic language values if you 
want to store so the purpose of these data types   is to enforce certain rule like if you define 
um um a type of a column like a date of path as   integer and you cannot store the uh your date of 
birth in that field so it's type of some kind of   checks you are doing and to enforce because 
uh another main important aspect of having a   proper data type is like uh certain functions you 
will call to say for example you want to get the   first four characters of a string okay then some 
string functions will work only based on this data   type whatever you define so these are the main 
purpose you need to define a proper data type   so another example i can give is 
like you want to add five days from   or sub back five days from the current date 
i mean to say from the date in that column   then in that case you have to use the date add 
function that takes the one of the parameters   date column date field date data type so if you 
are not defining your column properly then some   of the functions won't work so with this note i 
am explained the purpose of data type data types   how important it is to make 
your database proper design moving on to the sql statements once 
again let me start creating it so   this is secret table that we have already created 
and added one record into it so now we have   defined uh integer invercare and varket so i have 
mentioned uh both here in varchar and varchar so   now if we insert some other characters other 
than english characters or ascii characters   this will not support whereas this n care will 
support your chinese characters or your arabic   or other other than english language that 
is where unicode stands for there are mainly   other differences as well but understanding i 
am mentioning it to you there are some storage   uh reasons as well i mean there is storage 
wise it is optimal that is unicode character   for to begin with just try to understand there 
is two difference i mean difference between   worker and and worker so i have inserted a 
record i want to insert a few more records   that is two records here okay to shut 
the bangalore and let us try to query it okay now you can see here customer id customer 
name customer address everything was there   and then what happens when i try 
to change you know what's happening   i will try to insert it in improper adder like i 
mentioned customer id here which is integer column   but i am trying to insert a character value here 
and this is the character okay i mean uh that is   uh um string and this is where in a string okay 
what happens if i do like this yes it throwed a   error conversion failed when converting a value 
abdullah to data type integer it is trying to   convert this value to integer because customer 
id whatever you defined here is integer right   so you cannot insert a character value in an 
integer field so it's it's a kind of one check   that it is imposing these kind of checks that you 
cannot impose in a file system right if you in   excel if you are having one value one two three 
then again you cannot you cannot impose much okay   that that is what the people can start typing 
the name or whatever they want so i am not i'm   not saying only in excel the file systems they 
maintain notepad or other files so this is one   of the disadvantages in file system that will be 
overcome by database this is a classic example   uh why we need to go for databases as well so the 
next statement is like in the ddl is to alter now   you see here we have two records let me insert the 
third record now by replacing it with proper order okay yes so i'm inserting the third record there 
you go let's see this so one two three john   london shakshi and abdullah and now after 
i inserted now i want to add a new column   called a phone number and a gender okay so how to 
do that it is like altering the structure of the   table that is object the customer table is object 
you are trying to alter the structure correct   so for that you need to use alter table the 
table name that object name then add the column   whatever the new column you are specifying then 
the data type okay so this is the way to alter   your structure of the object for that just execute 
this now you go and see so whatever changes you do   in order to see the result you need to use 
select star from customer that is your tql   now as soon as you add it it doesn't 
we didn't say anything about the data   we are just adding a new column to this table 
that is what this altered table will do similarly   i want to add another column called gender 
which is character 1 let me query it   now there are two blank columns fine let us keep 
uh these two uh later okay uh drop and truncate   let me go to another important dml statement 
now we have seen create and alter then we have   inserted the record using the insert statement 
now i want to alter the structure means you go   for alter i want to modify the data means you need 
to go for update update is for modifying the data   okay so the another important statement 
here here is update customer set yum so what   will be the result of this query is like 
irrespective of your gender you are not   seeing anything over here just update m for all 
the rows okay that is what it is saying let us   try to update it let us keep it like this then 
you see the result now once again you see here   one two three everyone got the gender as m 
let us have it like that then what happens   i want to update the phone number let us keep the 
phone number as null as such we will do it later   now you understand the concept of update 
if you want to modify the record then   you need to use the update statement i am 
not modifying the existing record i am just   modifying the existing column value there 
is no value i have added new value here okay   so if you want to change for this particular 
london i will do it later by using about condition   we need to do it before that so i want 
to show you the last dml statement here   delete so when i want to clear this record okay 
everything i want to clear it what i need to do   you need to use a delete from customer 
that's it now you go and select this   table now there is no record okay so these are 
different statements you need to understand to   work in your databases okay so first to begin with 
create then you know to alter you need to alter it   then in order to insert the record you need to 
use insert statement if any record or data to   be updated you need to use update then removing a 
record from your table you need to go for delete   this is the core key concepts then what about 
these two truncate table and your delete table so   these are one of the important interview questions 
let me put the data once again into this table   so that you will understand so now you have us 
three more records again as i uh deleted the   record now i do not enter the gender now so again 
it will be blank now what is this truncate table   is doing it will also clear all the records from 
your table but some indexes if the table contains   that will also to be resetted okay the identity 
column will also be resetted there is some few   difference between delete and truncate where 
delete the key difference between delete and   truncate one of the important differences in 
delete statement you can use a wire condition   what is the wire condition to view the records 
you are using a select star from condition   customer right i want to see only this 
customer id too for that in order to filter it   you use a var customer id customer render id equal 
to 2 so i want to see only the customer h2 so   let me hold on a minute if there is no underscore 
it's only uh custody so i i can see only the   customer id2 when you use select star from table 
name it will display all the records in your table   i want to specify a filter out certain 
records then you can use a var condition   where customer id equal to 2 will give me 
only this record so similarly in order to   delete only customer 2 i can use a where 
condition here where customer id equal to 2.   so this will delete only sakshi now 
you can see in your customer table   you will have only the two records over 
here this is the key difference but whereas   the truncate there is no wear condition 
whatever records you have even it contains   1 million records it will clear it very fast that 
is the main difference between delete and truncate   now there won't be any data in your customer 
table and there are some key differences as well   and what is the drop table will do so drop table 
is nothing but will remove this will delete the   table itself see uh delete is deleting the 
data okay what drop will do is drop will   delete the table from the database there won't be 
any table anymore okay drop table table name now   if you see customer here when i go to click on 
tables and refresh customer table is gone there   is no more now you when you create it won't be 
available invalid object name the object itself   dropped that is what your drop will do i hope it 
was clear like what is um sql what are different   uh sql statements uh to manipulate and what is its 
purpose as well let me uh walk you through certain   other examples as i mentioned before like we have 
seen if insert wrong values like abdullah and   in three and four then i mean to say 
in the customer id is the integer   i need to insert an integer and what happens 
if i'm not mentioning the column order   like this will it insert yes it will actually the 
column order if you are not mentioning the column   however you have created it you see here the 
this order you have created it that in that   order this will get inserted insert into now i 
am saying naga and i am in say for example dubai let me insert now okay let us 
select this select star from customer okay now i didn't mentioned 
any order but still i can insert a   value and what happens by mistake 
user inserts a data like this dubai and he says is mr kumar or kumar kumar 
is not here fine what happens now let us see okay so now i mentioned i will just move it little 
up ok now you see here this is a statement i   have executed insert customer phi and dubai now 
what happened here so the customer address is   dubai but inserted in the customer name column 
whereas the customer name kumar is inserted in   the customer address column this is because 
the order you are not mentioned here okay   you see here in one of the example customer id 
customer name address and this order should be   the same and in order to do a proper insertion 
of into particular column like this okay you can   mention the values in different order but what 
you need to do is you need to mention it in this   insert statement as well as we do not 
mentioned it in this example it is   inserted in the created column as 
well in this order it has inserted now   in order to work this one i'm again inserting this 
record but what i'm doing it here customer address   customer name so insert into customer customer 
id customer address and customer name here layer   used to give customer name and customer address 
so this is the proper order now in order to give   different order you because once you create a 
table you don't know which order you have given   so you just pick up the column names here 
and based on the column names provided in   the insert statement columns you can mention the 
values so now once you insert the same record   let me put it for six okay again i am 
putting for kumar so what happened now yes so now even though i mentioned 
like 6 dubai and kumar the dubai value   is inserted into customer address properly you see 
for six right so this is how the some of the basic   things you want to understand and synthetically 
this is a syntax and you need to follow it   and how about your one of the update statement i 
mentioned like select star from where condition we   have seen similarly even in update statement we 
can use where condition now let me add a gender again you will see always once you do some 
statement changes you just try to um select   start from i mean select the data and see once you 
do this one what happens is like it will update   m for every every individual i hope for sakshi 
we need to uh update it as uh female right   so what the one of the simple 
thing i can do is where i will say customer id okay customer id equal 
to 2 i want it as f okay i want to put it as f   female for other than uh female now once you 
do the update go and select it always always   select star from customer so your life as a 
database developer will be in select star from   table only now you can see like only for 
sakshi i want to update so where condition   is basically restrict your data rows to filter 
it and update or select wherever it is possible   you want to apply it to filter a rows you want 
to use where condition now for other than 2   everyone is male so in that case i need 
to go for not equal to 2 make it as   f let us have this one as such 
let me copy and put it here mail and i will say not equal to 2. so this condition 
this condition will evaluate for each row okay   and say for example this is 2 so it will 
check for customer id 1 equal to 2 no 2   equal to 2 true then update this particular 
gender column and 3 it will say false so   like that it will execute whatever rows having 
a true value for that it will execute this   search statement that is the syntax for update now 
other than 2 every row will become true for this   let's see so it says 5 rows affected now 
let us see so this is how you can update   a newly inserted column for different 
combination you need to use different conditions so this is one of the important aspect of your the um i mean what you called sql statements so 
there are two things so i've covered it today   one is about data types how it is crucial and 
whether it's integer inverter you cannot insert   a numerical value into integer 
and the different sql statements and we will see uh another important concept 
here in the sql um in the table it's like   you can see here and null are not null oh 
what it is uh let me quickly show it to you   okay now i'm saying i'm adding another column here   like um phone number okay and which i'm 
defining it as um let me add one more table create table gender and what you have like um um in where care of or it's again it's a cat 
care of one and i will say it as not null   okay put it come on customer not not just 
for understanding and putting it here   now you see select star from i'm trying to explain 
how what are the different things you have it in   your table creation step that is core important   select staff from customer table not known is 
null now i want to take insert table script and this is a customer table not now let me 
put it here now this i defined as not null   okay what happens if i'm not putting this value uh 
at all that is i'm putting a customer address as   null okay even i can ignore it let me 
show it to you what i'm trying to say   um here first i'll put gender i'm 
trying to insert the value over here   what was it it was um wherever whatever 
chennai and i will put him as male okay this is fine now one john chennai and male okay now what 
what this is saying is like um uh this one   um null or not null this column should have 
a value not null means this column does not   allow nulls this always should have some value 
that is what it is saying so some columns are   optional meaning like this maybe some customer 
can give the address or not that is fine but in   your case like phone numbers and genders uh maybe 
it's uh like a dressing company i mean the retail   company they want to understand the customer 
base whether they are female customers or   gen's customer they want to record 
it then they will make that test not   they want to understand make that as a 
mandatory field in that case it is compulsory so   now you can skip the second value what i'm 
trying to say is let us copy this once again   i'm i'm not providing this customer address now 
okay in that case instead of address i'm not   giving any value over there what happens let him 
be two and his schumer is a male let me insert it   what happened now now the customer address 
is blank that is null this is allowed so   this particular null is a constraint that 
says this column will allow null that can be   a value or you can skip it whereas if i'm 
not giving a value for the gender column okay now i'm saying custom 
i will give customer address   now i'm not going to give any value to the 
gender instead i will give only chennai okay what happened to this statement you 
understand this two difference statement   difference now the error says cannot insert a 
value null into a column gender because of this   constrain column does not allow null how this 
error comes is because of this single constraint   okay so you are defining some imposing the rules 
as i said before these kind of rules are data   integrity you cannot impose in the file system 
that is why you are going for this database   management system now you understand this point 
now this record is not at all inserted that is two   kumar chennai is not inserted you can see this one 
two kumar blank that is this statement is executed   to kumar blank and male is executed but whatever 
you mentioned only chennai two kumar chennai is   not executed because you are not giving the gender 
in order to insert two kumar chennai with he may   be again i will insert just as a duplicate that's 
fine i want to i have to put this column here so you need to correlate this to any business 
scenario as i mentioned before so these are the   some of the constraints not null unique check 
so i will cover more on to uh next session uh   we will stop it today okay i hope uh i covered 
uh two of the topics one is about um um   introduction to data types and ddr dml topics 
then constraints i will take it next session hear that okay so uh yesterday we saw about uh 
norton constraint so we have a table over here let's see whether this table exists so there is no 
data and we have only three columns let me do once   again i'll put phone number as not null so i'm 
adding a column here now let's have phone number   so and yesterday i mean uh till this 
time i had only uh three columns inserted   see uh i'll first come to the norton part so now 
i have a phone number defined as not null here   as a constraint not null now what happens when 
i try to insert without a phone number okay i   mentioned only three columns here so phone number 
is not included meaning null is inserted it says   cannot insert a null value into a column phone 
number that that part i have seen yesterday   now when i want to insert i'll go and check 
what is the word care only i put so i put just   my quiet number this eight digits okay now when i do the same thing here 
it get inserted there are fewer columns   yeah see this is another important factor i 
want to inform you there are fewer columns in   the insert statement than the values specified 
in the values column meaning like see i first   statement indicates insert into customer i 
am saying you insert customer id customer   name customer address okay only three columns i 
mentioned but while giving the value i gave four   columns including a phone number so it wrote the 
error so you need to add the phone number as well now you see phone number i 
have added now i will insert it it succeeded so now you select the data now you 
got phone number so you might have a question like whether i need to mention the columns 
always if you remember the column order   people won't remember what columns order 
that created in the table what i'm trying   to say is if you are not specifying the 
column order here in the insert statement the sql will take the default order how you are 
created see here this is the customer so this   is the first column second column third column 
fourth column this in this order it will take okay   now what happens if i remove this order i mean 
this column specification will it work any guess it should work yeah you are expert i know 
so it will work again i'll do insert yes   it worked good but what is the data here 
see i have two records already i inserted   already this is the case but what is the big 
challenge in this is like you can't remember what   is the order of the column until you know this 
one say for example by mistake if i do like this the order is changed okay will it work yes obviously it 
will work know what happens so in the customer address 
place i have replaced okay see   the issue over here if you are not specifying 
what column i am just inserting here   by default it will take whatever order it has 
created now in order to achieve the proper   ordering now i will say see without specifying 
this london has been to customer name this john   has went to customer address now i can do a 
proper if i mention the column names over here give a minute it will be two basics 
for someone who already knows this so specifying the column order is very important 
now i can say whatever order i want okay   so the this london is nothing but my customer 
address so it should go in the second column here and customer name now you see let me 
select and show you the results first see now this record is wrong wrongly inserted okay now what i'm trying to say is whatever order 
you are specifying here customer id customer   address customer name customer phone number same 
value should be represented in the values as well   so now when i inserted instead of this 
wrongly inserted record i can have a   proper record here when i select it let 
me see let me show you okay now you see now you got london even you have one 
london john over here the column order   whatever inserted it doesn't matter when you 
select it it will properly insert into proper   values so it is always recommended to specify the 
column names while you are inserting okay just you   cannot skip it because people will forget what is 
the column order over here whatever you created   okay that is the thing it doesn't mean anything 
about the constraints just for your understanding   i told you back to the topic not null we have 
discussed now what are other constraints we have   we have unique check default we will discuss 
these three now i'll take primary key foreign   key later when i use joins so unique so 
now i told not null always i need a data   say for example norton i said the phone number 
i need mandatory okay but i don't want to get   people won't give phone numbers sometimes you 
as a customer i will say like i will not give   you a phone number because you will send 
me a message but i want the phone number   by default application design like that so you 
will put some dummy numbers over here default nagi one question yeah for inter 
can't we give any constraint like in   like size integer that is the size i 
mean yesterday i gone through this i mean   in this website you can go and check what is the 
size maximum size uh it will have like uh yeah i'm   not asking maximum size can we define the size for 
an end no integer by default it will have its own   say for example let us go and check it here it 
will have something like 2.3 million something   that is the maximum limit for integer so but 
it is understood it is a whole number big end   int data type so this is the value it will 
allow this much well this is the maximum size   but it is it is defined it is internally 
understood small it means only   28 characters something like that 128 so 32768 
32 000 768 you can if you uh type it as 32 07   770 it will throw a limit cost it 
can store up this value only but   i got it okay so but integer it will show 
this one so no need to specify the size okay now i always i used to have that 
feeling spilling mistake got you thanks   rabbani see thanks again so phone 
number i want to make it as default okay   what i'm trying to say is now you saw a normal 
constraint when only if the if it has a value   then only it will allow if doesn't have a value 
then as i need to put something in that place   so it's combination of both it's a not nerd 
you need to specify a value but if someone   is not specifying make it as default that 
is triple line some values say for example   some phone numbers okay this is your default 
let me create and you can understand better constraint create table customer constraint okay 
now you don't have data copy this guy see guys i'm trying to insert 
the existing record here so now you see my data is created so i have got six double zero three one now 
what happens if i don't specify my phone number   say for example i'm saying 
i'm removing this phone number then i didn't specify phone number earlier case 
what happened it is inserting a null when you see   when i create a column empty column 
it has created a null values now you   see default is nothing but you are 
stamping some values if it is missing   some value is missing you default it 
this is a constraint default constraint okay so default and we moving 
on to check constraint okay   check is like um you say like you want to have 
certain rule impose a rule say for example someone   is registering for college and whose age should 
not be greater than i mean should not be less than   18. so this is the rule you want to impose 
then i create a rule like age integer you cannot default it here but you can set a rule 
and you say like a check if age is greater than 80   or greater than equal to 18 so that solved our 
problem so i'm just dropping and recreating these   tables okay just so that so all these things i'm 
dropping and recreating because just you i want   you to understand from the beginning all these 
things while creating a table itself you need to   decide so that's why i'm doing one by one so now 
i again created this one now selecting it okay now uh i'm putting only the age here i'm i'm going 
to insert h i have two cases one failure case 14   and i mean it should fail insert check 14 come on insert statement conflicted with 
the check constraint so it says like   uh it is failed it doesn't inserted 
value anything right now so if i use 22 then fine okay and it has default to my phone number i 
didn't give my phone number so both constraints   worked so this is about check default and unique 
so there are certain things like uh my phone   number in this case defaulted to triple nine 
say for example my name should not be repeated   i should not have any other customer the perfect 
example should be a unique constraint other card   so i have a other number that should be unique i 
cannot repeat for different customers same other   number cannot be applicable to another person so 
in that case i will use unique constraint true let's keep this one here i say other again other is integer only so i will put 
integer okay i'll say unique just say uniq   it should be unique i'll go here age i'll say 
other then i use 98765 okay so and have a default value here 
and go and copy some more values so this is a commenting out 
meaning that will not be executed   you need to put two hyphens okay 
that will be commenting out that code something like this ah aj didn't put [ __ ] so the error message will be really clear see 
the error message there are more columns in   the instruct statement than the values so i have 
mentioned age i didn't specify age here that's why   so i say 34 i will give 34 for him and 56. now you see like each other is your unique 
986 876 87643 something like that what happens   when i try to insert a record with the same value over here i'll say i 
can have one over here i can have repeated   here repeat it here repeated here this guy is 
repeated same okay and use this constraint okay violation of unique constraint cannot insert 
duplicate key in object so if you see here compare this result with this data so one again london john and twenty 
two eight three eight seven six four three so this   is conflicting with this particular record so 
it is not allowing now i say i change it to nine this will allow now you see see i didn't impose any rules for this 
unique constraint for this particular column okay   and i i had a default for this phone number so it 
keep on adding the default even i didn't mention   if i do mention phone number it will update and 
age i put some restriction that is greater than   18. other it should be unique so if it is repeated 
then it throw error so these are the things   why why you need constraints just imagine in a 
business world guys okay so there should not be   any duplication of other information if someone 
is claiming some uh um some now you say corona   claim uh someone government is offering thousand 
rupees so they will come and whoever collected so   those other will be recorded here assume this guy 
again you are going in some other state and you   can claim people think like that but if it shows 
as unique constraint already you have claimed   instead of this certain message i can show like 
you already claimed in this particular location   don't come again something like that okay these 
are the things you impose in database level that   will have uh impact on your real business so 
that is why you need to have concentrate on   this constraint how you it is related to your 
business okay i hope this example suits well anything else guys for uh constraints no right so it's not only for numbers even like in some 
websites we create this with the same email id   they already tell us like already yeah it works 
on the same thing right exactly so it is not   for a particular number i am saying integer is 
easy to understand so it is for the data type   any column that column see it's for the column 
so understand about the column column will have   its attribute this is the attribute of your column 
that is nothing but your uh metadata i mean to say   this the rules are for the columns not for integer 
or character email as you said email perfect since   uh you cannot register same email id and 
netflix two times something like that same thing okay guys uh i will take this primary key find basically a primary key is defines your record 
okay i mean to say if you you want any information   for that customer you need one key to identify it 
that is what your primary key got it so like um   you have a other id for a customer then you have 
other id to be defined as your primary key then   you have your name all other things okay so what 
about if you do not have uh other id before other   id what will be your unique combination to create 
a record i mean to identify a person any area maybe a phone number yes before 
phone number phone came 10 years back okay basically yeah so basically i have uh it's a 
common name across the globe i mean uh some names   like uh uh sunil or raghav it's a regional name it 
will be common or some in case of arabic countries   like this a common name so you cannot create 
a primary key based on the name here you see   you have a customer id defined okay so customer 
id is there customer name is there so customer   id is nothing but whatever uid you generate 
if i don't have this guy i have only name   so the names are so common everywhere 
so how you can distinguish that one   it's like just give me a minute 
and drop this guy again drop table okay what i'm trying to explain here is the 
purpose of primary key so i have a name a customer   address phone number other now you in case of even 
a person have multiple phone numbers how to handle   it i i hope everyone has a two to four four for 
four numbers so can you repeat the record no right okay questions about please think now what is 
the primary key is like a primary key should   identify a record in a table if you want a 
uniqueness to be maintained in your table   that key should be identify that particular 
record once you give that primary key then that   record is for that there is no duplication 
it is a unique key as well internally okay   that is the definition of your primary key so in 
case of customer name uh you what you need to do   is like you need to have uniqueness but you cannot 
have a unique name for the customer it will repeat   so you need to add two possible combination 
combine these two columns he cannot be i mean   a person from same street does not have same name 
okay you need to find such a combination then you   create a primary key i hope uh somewhat little 
bit confusing let me create and show it to you so here instead of ide i 
will replace customer name   john is the let it be here 
the order doesn't matter since i have mentioned 
customer name here is the thing okay i'll copy this guy put it over here i'll put a same data back now you see guys john kumar london john 
is london and kumar is from bangalore okay   now i can have another kumar from 
bangalore okay so what makes me to   create a unique key over here is i mean if i use 
the primary key okay i cannot have another kumar   here so i will create a combination i just for now 
for now understanding there can be multiple comma   so you find the combination from your table 
that makes you unique so kumar and bangalore   i can create a combination of these 
two and create it as a primary key   now i say like i created a primary key here 
customer name as primary key dropper constraint create table i've created as a primary key so there is no difference 
once you create a primary key   no difference in the table 
structure and all its same when i insert a value inside kumar sorry here i say like naga okay now you have a kumar and naga now imagine 
i i that is another naga comes into place and he is from mumbai here i need to change this says like violation of primary key constraint 
cannot insert a duplicate key in object okay   so basically you need to have a primary key that 
defines if he is from i mean just imagine instead   of this customer you imagine as an employee okay 
employees you can have names as a unique values   and if you say that employees say for example in 
this session we have eight people eight people   have a unique name no just no confusion at 
all but if someone is having a name called   ganesh ganesh is joining from quite ganesh is 
joining from india so what makes them unique   location ganesh from kuit and ganesh from india 
so you need to distinguish the ganesh based on the   location so you will combine these two location 
i mean a name and a location as your primary key   that makes your unique value to identify a row 
okay simply a primary key usually you think like   only one column is considered as a 
primary key using a name now if we   if a username has uh different values like 
this abdullah all other things then no issues but in practical world okay abdullah kumar now you have inserted now that 
is why people always have a customer id generated   got you so in irrespective of location all 
these possible possible combinations i need   to create instead of that what i will do 
is i will create id for you customer id   then i will generate it as a primary key okay 
so that will identify me individual record   so this is your primary key concept now let me 
tell you what i am trying to explain the customer id so there's no records guys i think damn silent you are there hello yeah yes okay any confusion guys are you getting 
the point what i'm trying to convey any confusion no you got what 
is the purpose of primary key   now you see i have created a primary key 
here one two three so now instead of saying   if i have abdullah abdullah here it 
should be a abdullah from bangalore maybe verifying it in another table right 
like that is foreign key or primary key   see now i am trying to insert 
four okay like let me now wait guys as i told uh i have three abdullah's here 
okay so what makes you to differentiate from   this sub i if i created a customer id as 
a primary key i will generate i will have   a logic to generate this one two three four five 
and i will give this customer id to the abdullah   always if you come back to my store you give 
me customer id or you swipe in using your card   i that card is stacked with customer id so 
all buildings will be against the sabdillah   so i don't confuse with this abdullah that of the 
lord i am at least bothered okay so you need to   generate a primary key to identify a record so 
this four is your abdullah bangalore it doesn't   matter whoever abdullah here it is okay that is 
the main purpose of your primary key how you will   create based on the combinations you choose are 
the new customers they come they create a new   record that will have auto incremented values that 
i will explain it a little later so this is your   primary key now i say for he is abdullah bangalore 
even abdullah can be from quite but which differs   sim other card defers him so it doesn't matter 
how many abdullah whatever data they have i   mentioned only the primary key so primary key 
purpose is to identify a record in a table okay any doubts in his primary key always 
unique or you need to specify uniqueness   yes that is why i asked the primary key praveen 
when praveen answered he said like primary key is   used to identify a record and it is unique then 
i asked what is the difference that is why you   can't able to answer so this is nothing but uh 
the difference between your unique and primary   key primary key is not a unique you cannot 
switch between both i want a unique value   whether i can have multiple primary keys in 
a table no not at all you can have a single   primary key single primary key in a table that 
defines a record okay you can have a multiple   unique constraint say for example either i have 
a unique and phone number i have unique instead   of default i can also have a unique unique phone 
number okay so multiple unique key constraints   can be applicable meaning like unique is for a 
particular column and your primary key is for   the entire table yeah so this is what uh guys the 
main constraints and primary key all those things   so foreign key we will take it uh tomorrow 
already we are 10 minutes over time so   with this we'll stop today we focus on foreign 
key and before heading to foreign key so what are   these things says like it is used to implement 
a data integrity so what is says data integrity   so that our definition is like uh it is 
used to maintain some um data consistency or   relation between the data like that so uh the definition is like here so it 
refers to accuracy and consistency of   the consistency in the sense once you have 
a primary key and your check constraints so   your data will be consistent otherwise you miss 
some kind of rules if not imposed say for example   someone who doesn't have any age limit whoever 
applied for uh college then you will allow them to   apply for the college it is wrong so you 
are imposing certain rules so that your   data is accurate and your data consistency of your 
data is maintained that is what a data integrity   means okay so there are different types of 
3d domain integrities all these things use   it to create for a particular column and entity 
integrity entity is nothing but for your table   for enter table you are maintaining a primary key 
then for indeed that just now i'm going to explain   i mean i'm going to explain next so referential 
integrity these are some kind of integrity   data integrities that you can able to achieve 
only in the database all these things are   challenging features in your file systems okay 
so with this node let us move on to foreign key so we saw about these things like yesterday we 
have constraints all these constraints primary key   not null unique age limit 
check and everything default   so whether this table exists because 
i worked on something might be deleted so we have a data so customer john london this 
is the guy and i try to uh to refresh yourself   i just trying to give you some fix over here 
i mean this queries will throw error and you   you guys have to answer it okay so this contains 
one record i'm going to insert another record now   so this is also done so two records now you see you just 
see the constraints once okay quickly   so address is not null phone number is unique age 
is greater than 18 gender is by default to you   so these are the constraints i have now this guy   fix the issue by changing respective value when i 
run this one i will get an error so what it says which done okay so again so this record will be inserted now fix 
the issue by looking at the value itself we can   say violation of unique key constraint that 
is inside of duplicate object duplicate key   values 987 that is your phone number phone number 
here it is repeated so i put phone number already   here this guy already there same phone number 
when i try to insert it is throwing me error   so this is kind of for integrity data entity or 
imposing i just change it to nine something else done okay now i have this customer table guys 
customer id and name customer address phone number   h and gender okay now uh what 
is the referential foreign key   what is the purpose of foreign key is that you you 
need to ensure that whoever is the actual customer   those entries only should 
be available in the other   table or those those valid customers should be 
allowed to enter in the table so that is why   you impose certain rule whichever is a foreign key 
here he should be the pro i mean primary key here   this guy should be the foreigner of another table 
okay that is the rule you are trying to impose   so that your data is again maintained in 
the integrity manner so i have another table   say for example i have a purchase table here okay 
so this is a customer and i'm having a purchase   table like you are going to a supermarket or 
purchasing some items okay so what i do is like   i need to track a bill that will generate a bill 
now you have a he this customer is nothing but all   those guys okay over here uh customer name so i 
don't need to maintain the same information over   here in the customer purchase table just i will 
refer the customer id then what whoever purchases   in that particular bill i can refer this location 
phone number from another table that is customer   table customer constraint table this is the 
consumer constraint table so whatever you   are seeing here is nothing but your customer 
constraint table i am going to create the new   table customer purchase okay with the customer id 
referencing to the customer constraint customer id   let me create it okay i already created it 
okay so i'm trying to insert the records it was affected now let's 
see both the tables together let's start from customer constraint from customer purchase now you can see from this table so this is 
the customer master table which is having a   customer information and this is nothing but 
your uh assume it is uh something like uh   serial number line number in each bill you 
have some number so what it says like this john   one indicates john john purchased biscuit paste 
and bottle and he purchased two quantities of   biscuit and which is having a unique price of 20 
and placed six rupees bottle 60 piece so these   three rows belongs to john okay next two rows 
belongs to abdullah and these three rows belongs   to kumar from bangalore not from chennai okay now 
this is a customer ide having a primary key here   unique information that is for a single record 
but i mean single record per customer this   particular row identifies this customer but 
here it is repeating okay so from this you can   see like foreign key can be having duplicate 
or it can have multiple values foreign key   correct now what is the main advantages 
of having a foreign key as i said before   you cannot have a customer ide five here okay 
in this purchase table okay without having the   information in the customer master table so let 
us try to insert a customer identify in this table   okay then let's see what is the issue happening i say like customer five okay he 
is purchasing biscuit let it be   three items five biscuits he is 
purchasing when i try to insert it   it says like the insert statement conflicted 
with the foreign key constraint the conflict   occurred in the database okay in the particular 
column customer id so what it does is that each   time when you try to insert a customer id foreign 
column it goes and checks in this particular table   customer contract that is primary key whether 
that value exists or not it does something like   a constraint okay it is like checking each time 
when you do a insert whether that value already   exists in the primary key table so let us select 
this guy once again now you do not have a phi   here you can't able to insert unless you have 
a value in this customer master table so let us   insert a customer id phi here then we will try 
to insert here then what happens we'll check so we take customer master customer con pro   i will have is put it under debug chennai 
his number is 67890 and his age is 32. let's insert him now what happens now we have a new customer here okay deepak and 
now when i try to insert in the purchase table   he purchased i mean customer id5 purchased 
biscuit 5 and each cost to 20. now i insert   now it got inserted now you got it guys so without having a 
master information created you can't do the   transaction okay that is what uh 
the main purpose of foreign key so   why we need to impose all these rules to 
maintain the data integrity okay so that   your system will be consistent this 
is the thing any doubts guys in this this is from purchase this is customer 
master when you run this uh when you   run the customer purchase out this 
checks in the customer master file yeah yeah that is what i'm saying i didn't create 
that is the purpose of the dbms written a program   they have written a program saying that 
that is what the definition says you see   like here when you see the definition of these 
two tables let me bring both the tables together ctrl reset ctrl c so the checking happens internally 
okay that is the program written   so you see like customer id in 
the customer master or customer   constraint as a primary key now here customer 
purchase table i need to say this is the foreign   key foreign key always will refer the primary 
key of any other table so foreign key references   i mentioned customer control customer id 
okay okay yeah here you need to define   and that is why i mentioned okay so this is 
uh this will be internally taken care by the   tbms that is the program it controls that is the 
software duty to check okay okay the customer yes   yes uh the customer purchase table like you 
have given the foreign key like customer id   and it's a primary key whereas if you have given 
like customer name one minute so in the customer   purchase table customer id is not a primary 
key you know in the customer constraint it's a   primary key yeah wherever you are given in that 
foreign key like uh at last we have given the   main ideas customer id so if i have given there 
the customer name like that means it's not it will   not work right it will not pick up it will not 
pick up you see there's your customer id it will   always reference to a primary key only so you okay 
whatever you define as a primary key in another   table that column only you need to queue you you 
can have a unique value instead of customized you   have other card okay that is fine but whatever 
you define in this table as a primary key that   only you need to refer here that is a thumb rule 
there is no clarification okay okay okay guys   so the another important purpose is like people 
are always maintain like the disadvantages of a   file system as i said so assume like you maintain 
the customer information in this one file   and the purchases in another file what will happen 
if you lose some information somewhere you are   losing here or you are losing here um let me tell 
you let us uh delete this guy uh try to delete uh   the customer master kumar from bangalore 
what happens so any guess what happens now okay uh delete from this line customer id 
so i i want to delete the customer id3 okay you see the data once again so 
that you it will be clear to you so here i want to delete this guy but this 
guy already have a transaction over here   okay delete from customer master or customer 
constraint it says like uh the daily statement   conflicted with reference constraint foreign 
key because unless you delete the related   information the foreign key information the 
master information won't be deleted okay because once you delete this guy this will not 
become any meaning because it's always referencing   this value so when you keep on referencing it 
okay if it will not allow you to delete but   when you delete this guy then 
you come and delete this guy   then it will happen so always it should 
flow from this direction okay from foreign   key you need to delete then only your master 
information to be deleted let us try that one customer purchase okay now when i delete from 
purchase it will delete then   so earlier throughout error now it got deleted 
so these kinds of rules and the constraints   will make you to maintain your data 
integrity okay now it got deleted cleared off   i hope i'm clear guys so with this note uh we'll 
stop about constraints let's focus uh more on   other models now uh you guys have any doubts i'll 
give a minute and then i'll move on to next topic so login primary key in a table there is only 
one primary key can be but we can include   more number of columns uh we can add too many foreign keys yeah yes 
in a single table you can have a multiple   foreign keys because your 
foreign key is nothing but see   you can create this product master you can 
see that biscuit is repeated that's why   desperately put a biscuit two times so you see 
like this customer also will purchase a biscuit   this customer also will purchase a biscuit okay so 
you assume you have another table for product okay   and this product is maintained as uh i mean 
primary key then you can have multiple foreign   keys in a single table no issues okay so primarily 
foreign customer id or phone number yes yes   yes yes exactly so in this definition 
you assume like you have a another table like product master so here 
you need to define test for in   key references while declaring so these things you 
need to be very careful while uh designing okay   all these things comes when you're designing 
product master product id or product name okay something like this this table 
doesn't exist that's how you throw it   now you see customer id references customer 
master or customer constrained customer id references product master productivity like this 
you need to define so as a to summarize a table   can have only one primary key and the primary key 
can have multiple columns on contrast a foreign   key will reference any of the other primary keys 
and single table can have multiple foreign keys okay now another uh point i want to touch here is you 
see like customer purchase table i'm inserting   only customer id product quantity and price okay 
so each time when i do a insert there is something   automatically one counter is increasing that is 
your row id you see here 9 10 11 12 13 14 18.   something i deleted three rows so in between 
three rows gone so 18 when i do some other insert like this i can do another insert also   this guy again came the customer again he can 
come okay the show so again he came now you see uh 1920 this is i mean 1920 these two records got 
inserted now okay so one two here initially it   was the case now again he came for the shop 
and he purchased a biscuit and paste again   so 1920 so this number i am not specified anywhere 
in my insert statement okay insert statement   so to auto increment some values 
based on the incremental values   it is similar to a default default what it 
will do always it will stamp a single value   so i want each time one row to be incremented so 
for that a function name called identity identity   one comma one so in oracle we have sequence 
sequence one comma one something like that okay   so some it is a function you need to specify 
meaning that begin from one increment by one   if i do increment by two then it will go see 
the sequence follows like this one two three   here if i say for example 3 1 4 7 10 13 
something like that keep on adding from   the last whatever the digital so this 
is the purpose of your identity column any doubts in this identity no okay guys let's move on to the next topic in overall topic here we have seen this one 
i mean insert update and delete slightly   we will discuss more about this now i'm going 
to go more deep into dql that is data query   language select it here it is written only 
select and we will do more magic in this   for that i will try to go some table over 
here because i can't do much over here okay i got customer data over here so you have a 
first name last name so similarly you see i have   used the customer data over here with minimal 
columns each customer phone number so in a real   world okay you have a customer data with all 
these attributes see guys you have a customer   is john okay now you have got a customer key 
okay this is the actual key i mean maybe a id   for him for this particular column i mean this 
particular record you have all the attributes   nothing but first name birth date medicinal 
status all these things are belongs to this   particular customer as i said this john 
is not belong to this guy he is belongs to   this so this is nothing but your 
record okay record a row in a table   now so when i want something like uh some y so 
when you insertion updation deletion you know   guys now i want to have some queries saying that 
i want someone who has born over 1970 i mean 1970 so then what you need to do like this business scenarios will come select i 
will put select star from this table name okay   what i'm trying to explain here is you you 
have learned about insertion updation and   deletion and all now after insertion what 
it will do you need to access the data   based on business scenarios i want to know how 
many bachelors in my customers how many married   people in my customers and i want to know uh 
whoever has not provided the email address   or whoever is male and whoever is 
male and it is married or single   something like that it should be bachelor or 
college graduate something like that so business   scenarios will come they will keep on asking the 
question this is where i think uh my colleagues   they find most of the time i mean they always 
go for queries a lot of questions will come   from the business and we need to query it 
so the one and only statement is select   the syntax as follows as like select star this 
star is nothing but if you see star when i   highlight it displays the column star means all 
columns in the table you can specify a single   column also say for example customer alternative 
key i can select only this but it doesn't give me   any view just give me a data of it okay so i 
can put it like this also i want to bring some   columns friend i can bring that column front then 
go for it so so this is you till this we saw about   only querying like select star from table name 
what about this i mean it was like that control   why it was three distinction values what are those 
okay we'll take this later this is nothing but for   now explanation this is database this is a schema 
and this is your table okay i'll tell this later yeah you you know better i think you 
already learned just hold on okay the request of procedure failed by okay see either i can choose c i can run from my sql 
training schema this is the database it's going   to run if i use this i can access the another 
database also syntax error from select start from   it defines intel database queries okay forget 
about that just keep it simple as that dbo dot dbo dot dim customer then where to filter whatever columns you want to 
filter you need to use a bad condition but i won't   just say gender i mean a male customer you put 
gender equal to yum so this is the syntax select   column name or star and from your table name then 
where condition to filter if you do this one there   is no filter all the records 18 000 records will 
come now you use bar condition that will filter   only male customers execute it you see out of 
eighteen thousand nine three five one is your   male customers let's go for i'll take account here 
nine three five one if it's female how much 9 1 this is main then it's female 9 1 three 
three okay so this is just a typical query   how you need to um query your database 
okay simple basic query about uh   select statement now when i have something 
like whoever gets more than 60 000   so these are the operators you need 
to learn i'll keep this query as such greater than that is yearly income yearly income 
greater than 50 000. i think this is in us dollars again 9000 maybe i will increase uh slide whoever 
gets most of it eighty thousand usd means i think   it's around uh six lakhs per month so only three 
thousand people who has a yearly income eighty   thousand okay so if you see the results it 
filtered with eighty thousand greater than   maybe if i use equal to the result 
will change three zero four zero okay four three eight so everyone i mean to 
say uh whoever having instead of having uh   greater than or equal to i mean i can 
put equal to that will give me thousand   records thousand three four two okay you 
see the result now exactly the matching   so these are the operators okay like uh 
what operators you have conditional equal to   greater than less than these 
are the operators you use here let's go to the syllabus select statement using strings and arithmetic 
operation exploring where class with operators and   i go for top distinct null etc okay fine so now 
you see like uh just just a basic understanding   of uh gender and uh yearly income i saw with only 
one column what happens now whoever gets 80 000   and also i want a female a female customer who is 
getting a salary of 80 000 this is the condition   so you need to combine both the condition 
here so you need to use and just apply in   yearly income 80 and gender equal to 
female so if i use like this this will not   allow always string values should 
be coated with single quotes so i use both so my results are drastically 
reduced like 671 when i use this alone   it is one three four two so i can say like um it's one three four two and female is six seven one so what about your male so these kind of checks you can make by 
yourself while doing some kind of work   what i'm trying to say is 671 so it's 
exactly same so even male is 671. see i got output before i know that data when i 
subtract it it will come so this is simple thing   okay so how many conditions you can have you 
can have many condition as such based on your   business logic uh based on the request there 
is no restriction like only two condition three   condition you keep on adding the condition so this 
is like early income eighty thousand gender male   and how many kids i want only one kid or without 
a kid something like that okay so maybe i will add and total children equal to one it's like a question and answers you got using 
your query so people will ask you a question   who are a male person having a one children and 
getting a 80 000 salary how many people are there   we will give this list so what they will do using 
this they will do some analytics on that they want   to promote some offers for these customers who 
is having only one child okay something like that can you also tell me some specific um period 
after which some greater than or equal to yes yes yes i didn't cover so i will come to here   first so date similarly uh integer n worker 
this one you have a date data type like   i will say date of birth i can go for um 
date time okay date time and i'll draw so date you can uh it's it's little bit tricky 
always you need to use the appropriate format uh   ddm yy mm-hmm what i'm trying to 
say is either you can specify yy mm   dd this is the standard format used to follow okay so in this format only you need to insert   yeah why mmdd so in the same 
example i will specify date of birth so how you need to specify either you can use   the same format i mentioned 1988 to a 29 
say say like that okay i'll insert this guy okay so 1988 december 29th okay this is the and time 
also you can mention i didn't mention the time   so it taken the midnight of 29.00 if you born 
on a second no one cares about the time i mean   typically recording i mean in the database 
level only to astrology i think we use time fine so now to answer your question so 
date is same like any other data type now   i want uh some dates like whoever born after 
1970 so here we have something like and you keep adding no restriction okay birthdate greater than you take a copy you say like including see this 
will say like uh including 70 i mean to say first   of january i mean 1917. this greater than or equal 
to means including this date if you remove equal   to this is excluding this date from the second of 
1970 okay january 2nd so include means equal to so there are customers who are born 
after 1970 so five customers over here   so this is simple typical example okay and uh 
date functions functions will come through it now yeah if if the database has a year month and date 
and suppose if we need if we need month date and   year format it should just be displayed in the 
same the way which we require we need to have   appropriate function there are a lot of functions 
okay no one knows the syntax see like uh uh format   paraman param2 and param3 and we 
need to specify appropriately see but   that it can be either first parameter 
second parameter now you see mm mmm dd wherever y something 
like this let's try that one now it worked see here went at last something has 
happened instead of tool something it has happened   so you can do it okay it's not uh doable 
you need to find appropriate function   and do it usually it will be like 
convert will use cache will use format   so in oracle also i think it will 
be format or some other function   so it doesn't matter just for we need to find 
appropriate function everything is possible okay when you see the budget comparatively you 
can see the result what what happened so   it has converted the dates and mm it is 
doesn't convert it maybe we will say mmm   something like this yeah now it worked 
december 17 1976 march 18. okay we can do it find the book thanks yeah so now you got a kind when you want to work through the database you 
always not going to work with all the columns are   all the records over here you have 18 000 or some 
tables contains millions of flows it will while   running the query itself takes a 
lot of time for that what you do you   do the sampling of records seeing this column 
definition doesn't make you to understand what   is the exact data whether some data is there 
or not okay so always you want to see the data   at that time you can't see the entire 
data so you can use top 10 top 10 records   which will give you first 10 records so that 
you can analyze understand what kind of data it   has whether people are filling the email whether 
yearly information is there something like that   so top 10 just for profiling purpose we 
will use this one now you can ask me like   i know that i i have all these columns all in 
place but what about this guy i mean english   education or here you have english occupation 
what are the different occupations i have   i want to only the you see this is 
repeating i don't want like this i'm saying what are the different occupations we have 
professionals management and skilled manual   all those guys while inserting they will 
keep on adding it okay then i need to get   those distinct values so just you can mention 
distinct of that column name english occupation when i use this one i will get 
there five different values in this   column professional clerical manual 
and management skilled manual   so these are the different values so no need to 
go each and every uh record over here and see you   cannot copy and paste you got the point right if 
someone ask you what are the things you can you   go and check you take this value then you keep 
on taking this value you don't remember which   one is already you have taken or not so just 
putting a single query will give you what are   the distinct values unique values in this table i 
mean in this column so this is about your distinct   then as you asked as i told you when you use this 
select statement you always see like 26 37 31 11. again i'm running 26 at 7 31 11. okay so as i 
said it will collect the data based on the order   how it has inserted based on the index logic it 
worked but i want certain order like geography key   starting from 1 to ascending i mean so 
how you specify so select from this one   where condition used to filter i want 
to display the results in some order order key order by see basically it doesn't 
inserted by geography key and all you see   the customer key so because based on the 
customer key it has inserted i don't want   to be displayed by customer key i want it to 
be displayed whoever based on the earlier date   of birth ascending order of date of birth so 
order with birth date you mentioned ascending now you see the customer key has changed one two 
three instead whoever has borne earlier 191602   i'll show both the results together 
so that people will understand this should be top okay now this doesn't have first query doesn't 
have order this has order based on the birthdate   you see the results based on the customer key 
always it will fetch based on the customer key   here the customer key changed it which 
it picked me the oldest birthdate   since it's ascending i can use the descending also 
so whoever is the youngest will come first again   again it picks up from the same order here 1986 
is the latest so from that it has picked me so   if i want to use multiple columns say for example 
bug date as well as gender then put comma gender descending or ascending if you don't specify 
anything then it is by default ascending so ascending in the sense f 
will come first m will go next see if we use two columns order it takes long time but it descending i j k l m f why it's showing 
sending i need to specify hold on ascending means m is coming first i'm not sure okay okay see in based on this combination in 
this date only m is available okay and in 20   second only female is available so it it filters 
by a group in this date first it filters by date   in this if you have multiple columns 
then f will come first em will come first   maybe if i change this order 
you'll understand better all females will come first 
then on that it will have a date female female female then here you have it forget about this 
i mean just ordering how you want to   query or see the data so the entire query 
enter life in sql you will work on this   you will have these things 
like select from where order   so this is the hierarchy you need to follow you 
cannot put the word condition before where class doesn't work syntax error okay incorrect syntax so 
always you remember this order of execution select   from where and order by so this should be your 
flow and in between you have uh before order you   will have a group by also okay this should this 
is the whole uh sql statement there is no more   uh addition to it group will take it 
later so this is the thing got it guys yes yes we have touched a little bit about this i 
mean queries stop or distinct now you will see   some of the string and arithmetic functions   actually i thought of taking uh joints but today 
i think varun has not joined boron also wants to   learn um joints so let us focus more on this 
functions tomorrow i will take up the joints so now we will stick to one table okay um 
let us have uh yesterday is the big   table that we have saw so that we 
can have multiple functions together customer again okay fine so now yesterday we saw about 
some of the operators simple operators   in the back condition that 
we sent now i am going to   work on some of the functions that we have to use 
always we need to have it is not as simple as that   whatever you store so say for example sometimes 
you may require only the characters from before   this at symbol if you see here from the 
email i want to extract only this guy i want to extract before that part 
this part alone so you need to work on   some kind of functions you need to impose 
certain rules to it so let us have a very simple   example now we can come to this extraction 
of the part before this at symbol now   i want from the email i want first four 
letters always to be written okay as an output   what you need to do let us have um we 
we need to have only two columns now i will have email address other 
other columns i will remove select email address oh see when you have output like this 
so your window you can switch between   these two options results to grid 
results to text results to grid okay now what i want is now i want um 
first four letters from this email so there is a function called substring substring of your email address which column you need to specify comma 
one comma four so one is your beginning   of your uh character i mean starting point and 
four is your length so if i select like this   i got uh john two ego each something like 
that but i don't have it says like no column   so to give a new column so it is like a derived 
column this is your actual column which always   have a column header and whatever you are deriving 
you need to specify some column name so i will say first for here or small email small 
email something like that okay so this is nothing but your alice 
name alice name is nothing but   in going forward your queries your you can use 
this name as a reference that is what alice name   for this table also i can have analyze name 
called start name cast something like this   so this is going forward instead of specifying the 
entire name i can use this this is your alice name   short name uh you cannot say short name it's alice 
instead of this you use this name for reference now it says no column now it says small email 
so this has came with a small email so this is   very simple function using strings so you got the 
idea guys like you cannot have just a simple uh a   table you always you need to use appropriate 
functions the requirements are very different so now you have a lower upper r trim 
l trim string split so simple as that   now you want everything to be uh per lower 
these are excel functions you remember   guys everything is available in excel 
whoever worked in excel they aware of it so i'm doing it for only single column it is 
not mandatory you need to work for a single   everything turned into caps so 
you can use another column also   so each column you can derive but everything works 
row by row for each row the appropriate column it will work so say for example i need to concatenate these 
three columns first name last name middle name i   just use uh plus symbol so everything is a string 
then this thing these three will be combined   if it's a numeric to string 
concatenation it will throw error you see everything is joined john v young   so this guy doesn't have a name at all no this guy 
see another beautiful thing we got now so this guy   uh is written with null so meaning 
that this guy doesn't have a name come again the guy doesn't have a middle name 
oh you saw the output you were telling no no   i saw the input oh yes you saw the data before 
okay you see here another interesting uh thing   to discuss like these guys these two guys had all 
the three so you got the output so something added   with the null can't get it with null then it 
becomes knowledge so null plus anything is null   into anything is null so null is very tricky 
so what what to do in this case can you guess i need to add all the three so what i need 
to do if some column is null so always first   name last name is make it as not but middle 
name some people have some people don't have   so if it is now what i need to do i need 
to insert an empty character here so   in database level you cannot add 
an empty character so while giving   the full name what i need to do i am saying 
instructing this if is null this guy is null   okay is null of this particular column then 
have some empty character or you say hyphen okay so reuben hyphen taurus for these guys 
there won't be any hyphen okay just stands   for your understanding i i usually put like this   empty character so you will not find a 
difference that's why you put in hyphen now you see this is the column 
we are deriving full name so it's like a magic guys it's like you playing a   game you can play with this data usually we will 
say like that we will play with data so you see   the difference here so like this you need to learn 
a lot of functions when to use what functions   appropriately it will be used how to handle it so 
most of the time we will face like that if the we   will ask give the full name then we will give 
the entire thing without checking these things   so just check your output is color if it is wrong 
then you need to use appropriate function how to   fix this these rules you need to know okay 
let's have a look at some other functions at index length different current x okay 
current x is an interesting function so now i want to find where this art indicates 
some people will ask some you assume there is   some feedback given and some people say like 
this particular string i want to find some   bird words are some things from negative 
reviews there and where it was there i mean   which what character it was there something 
with it uh you need to find some iphone or some   special characters that where it exists okay you 
need to find one so i use this where this at exist so for that car index character index input comma expression expression means 
you give the email address   maybe i'm not sure it can be before and 
after i mean either you should uh specify the   which character you are searching 
for i want to search for that   and uh it says like you need to find the syntax 
i i'm not sure about the syntax i can't remember   just lc expression expression and start location   you can start looking from uh fifth character 
you can start looking from first character   let's say like uh for john 1 2 3 4 see this guy 
it is at right one two three four five and it   should return six for this guy it should return 
more than 10 or 20. say i will put one here index it is other way around if it is not coming 
like this then quickly i will change so first   character is what to church next uh oh sorry this 
is this should not be a course it should be okay   let us try column this is the column input okay 
yes so i have this sixth character here and here   it is a ninth character and eighth character 
when i say like uh starts stretching from uh   10th character or here or maybe eight characters 
when i change it to eight these two will return   zero i mean this will return zero this will return 
one uh maybe let us see how the how it works see this doesn't find at all because i'm saying   start the search from the a characters so from 
here that is not symbol so here it is start from   eight but it returns nine only so eight and 
immediately it finds next character it's nine   okay so these are the scenarios that will come in 
your uh work life so where you need to appropriate   functions when to search so skip for five 
characters then start searching from the tenth   character so all these things you no need to write 
your big logics and all everything is predefined   you need to go and search here find appropriate 
functions uh what are the different functions   available then you will do it that's all 
okay so let's start with some of the um um functions that uh finally gave this indx 
right index uh just analyzing okay okay fine   so just an example if say email address 
i just want to drive only the at wherever   for this email letter spacing if suppose if 
anything uh we have some unique uh data yeah   and some of the rows which doesn't have the unique 
data in those cases i need to retrieve only those   unique data and whenever the it's not available 
it can be zero or whatever number or something   in those cases how to try no can you can you 
refine your question i mean you mean address we   can say at is uniq okay so i need to retrieve only 
that wherever it's available i mean you say you're   saying i want to uh retrieve only that symbol 
uh over here right you need to write combination   of functions okay so let me uh write that query 
uh it will take uh um maybe at least 30 seconds   okay so you tell me uh the logic how to find 
so in this case you are saying some some   uh in some cases you have that 
symbol at physics position okay   you are having the symbol of this 
expression you can able to find the   position of the uh symbol using this current index 
now i want that particular character okay in this   position so this should be the input of another 
function similarly what we did here substring is   input to the length function so now i need a 
character index of this particular hat and i   need the character in that particular position 
okay it is again we can use substring here i think so string off this will return the 
sixth position right so this is the starting   position of the substring okay so searching what 
it will do is so in this position you need to give   this input and how many characters 
you want only one character yes   that's the thing so it's just a 
programmatic approach how you work okay okay okay so use we need to use a substring   substring combination it depends uh based on 
the scenario how we was done you recommend your   requirement is now i want add symbol and using 
this if i use two characters three characters i   mean three characters from that symbol i can get 
a next three characters okay is there any like yeah i don't know whether it's in a microsoft sql or not so similarly we used 
to give right like equal to this yeah like   like percentage yeah yeah i'll come to 
that uh in that condition we can use   those things so it's like it's not like 
a like here like it's used for something   else i will come to that uh condition now so 
i just i want to cover some more functions in   integer then i will go to like and where 
conditions what are the other combinations so i don't think um okay math functions 
so all the functions where any programming   language whatever programming languages 
you you use those things will automatically   applicable here so what i'm trying to tell you 
is let us save this guy as string functions scripts string function may be functions i'll say okay so everything you can work only with your table 
so there is no way of working any anything else   you will have a plsq there you can have a 
little bit of programming i don't have any   decimal values here going back to 
our module here because we have some decimal values here no no way why 28 comma decimal numeric i'll 
find try to fix that one let's have a okay so let's let's have a some addition you 
want to add these two just this column plus   this column you can add it like this so if it is 
a string to string then concatenation will happen   then if it is a numeric then 
your addition will happen so this is one comma one also known as like 
this should not be summed up we don't know   just i'm saying so so this will return only the 
values after addition so just you need to ensure   it's correct or not so keep those columns before 
uh doing the calculated column computed column   so square one plus zero is zero one plus one 
is two so you are returning a correct values so   simple addition subtraction arithmetic operations 
using a row over row you can use this one okay uh so all other mathematical 
functions also you can compute wait logical function choose and are not required these are not for us okay now let's focus on 
where condition you said like so now you have um here 
select star from dim customer   you asked like where condition so 
when it starts from so if you say like where english education equal to you 
need to desperately specify batch list   then you need to specify uh equal to symbol 
here but most of the time we are not sure   what is the spelling over here whether it 
contains proper value you need to search   in appropriate approximation so in that case 
you can choose like like it starts with b b   then you need to say percentage percentage means 
it can have any values after that so whichever   starts with b all the tones will come let me 
put distinct here as we seen yesterday distinct english education bachelors only so when we say c no english education starts with c let us see   now you have partial high school and partial 
college so when i put here that starts with p   partial okay both the things will come 
okay my spelling is correct wrong partial only these two will come so when i say like 
little bit further i want only starts with c   it can be a college or high 
school only c will come   take some time only c is coming i'm excluding 
the h so this is the way how it works now   i want in between the text with uh the 
common okay that contains o in any of the   values i mean in between any of the text 
like what i'm trying to say is i want   the english education where it 
contains a text like oh anywhere   oh so you need to put percentage before percentage 
after so oh wherever it is it will pick it up so it excluded some other 
part like if you see here   and graduate degree doesn't have 
o so it excluded it it brought me   four cases so this is very uh important uh 
function like like condition that we use okay   yesterday we saw about r i mean uh yesterday our 
previous classes i mean unconditioned let's say   like i have a male uh gender and who is having a 
salary of eight thousand and what about uh when i   have a male or he can be married or unmarried 
you should use our condition also so whatever   functions you use and and or you you understand 
the difference between under or right if say like m and s so it should be m equal to s and 
m and s should be there in this both the columns   and if you say m r s here m and r s means it will 
pick up all the m's here all the s's here in this   case let me take excel the difference between 
and r i don't think you need to work both on this let's say male female here and use have yes and t   values so the possible combination of these 
two is nothing but your i will repeat this guy twice okay here also yes also t and t okay so 
unconditioned means i say like m and s only this   row is returned when i say m r yes okay here it's 
gender it says like state as you consider status   when i say gender and gender equal to m and 
status equal to yes then this will return only   this row okay m and s and means it should 
match this also should match if i say like m r yes gender equal to m so 
this will return this record   because of this is true and this will 
return this record because this is true then   it comes with it checks status is yes and 
obviously if this is true because of this reason   and this reason and this will also return this 
record so it will return one two three records   so this is the difference between r 
and n so you need to be very careful   while choosing and condition and or condition okay 
so for each column it will keep on adding a true   or false based on that either one of the true then 
it will go it's generic i mean we have studied in   some trigonometry or mathematics 
it's mathematics rules okay i hope you got the point let us try one equal to jump i'll put r maritime status equal to yes so this brought me uh both m and 
yes see now you see like here   i have brought f also why because this becomes 
true this is m i want male gender only but   this for this condition it becomes true 
and for this also true and if i say and so all the records the records 
drastically increase 4085 okay   got the point this so this is the crucial thing 
where in bad condition you can have multiple com   combination you always go for and 
rr equal to and any greater symbol   even you can have this functions care index of 
this functions you say like what it will return   it will return at right so you say like 
uh see see guys what i'm trying to say is why so here you have a trait   same function also i can have i mean 
you can write a function also over here let it be like this and i want whichever character having at   if you say like you find some other characters 
that character alone you want then you can get so   same four zero eight five if i change the symbol 
to something else like star or eight star input it will not return any of my record okay so 
it's like how you each row it will go and check   whether this condition is fast this condition is 
passed and after returning whether this condition   is passed so either you can use the functions in 
select class are in the backlash it doesn't matter okay this i'll stop here anything so we have a customer information and as i said if 
we need to get some information we always need to   work on select queries that is dql queries 
so based on the requirement people will ask   different queries and using our select statement 
using what condition will filter the records   we will use a different condition and our 
combination to get the results so we saw about   these operators equal to greater than 
less than these things are used in um   numerical values greater than 100 less than 100 
are greater than or equal to like this less than   or equal to like this and there is some cases 
you need to filter with the range like uh date   of birth whoever born between 1970 till 1980s 
so you need to get the between the range okay   so for that cases you used between is the keyword 
or operator vc so let me have that query where   now the scenario is you need to get the list 
of customers who has born between 1970s till   1980 okay so for that case you can write different 
one of the easiest way is like writing birthdate you need to mention two days 2000 sorry 1970 0 1 0 1 then and so if you 
use between then you need to use and obviously so 19 uh what you need to both the dates are included 
okay so you need to write 19 80 tour 31   so this jail also included this 
data center when you use this one so there are seven thousand five customers 
was born between this decade seventies   you can see quickly 79 79 75 those things 
okay only it's between this range see even 80   april so this is the about 
between keyword or operator   now there are certain things like uh earlier 
we used to query using a equal to operator that filters only one 
particular case like if i want   only the bachelor's customer or as a 
bachelor then english education equal to i mean whoever did bachelor's degree it's   it tells about your education so 
i will filter using batch list now imagine a situation like 
i need a bachelor's as well as bachelor's as well as i need something 
like who did the partial highest secondary   so i need both the cases so in this case 
there are different ways to write either   you can use r condition where english 
education equal to bachelor's are again see the see the syntax guys so you cannot 
put english education batches or the value   so once you're done with the single column 
and value column and value you are done with   your one condition then another condition 
you need to specify the column name again   so english education again equal to okay so this 
will give me both so if i run this one it gives me   five thousand five three five 
six so let me put in another way next so if you keep writing like this i'm saying 
the count i'm trying to take the count so that it   it gives you the proper output 1 8 1 5 
8 1 so this partial high score is one   five eight one you can see the record cons 
here one five one now i'm running only the   bachelor's i'm not running the partial high 
school so bachelors is five three five six five three five six okay so let me copy this guy and put it here so now i am putting both cases   so it is addition of these two one five 
eight one and five three five six if you put   r so it should return me something around six nine 
three seven so this is the correct results okay six nine three seven so uh we have 
different ways that is one highlighted   this is one way of writing then what happens 
if my lists keep on increasing like i have a 10   members in that list i need to put it in a filter 
okay so for that instead of putting like this   i can put it here in in condition so the list 
here it is not a list so it is like in condition   you can put multiple values over 
here it will return multiple values so this query this query will 
return same so this has written 6937   you see here this one also written 6937   6937 so now to summarize so we have a between 
operator to filter out using a range and we have   in condition to filter a list list of values okay 
now the same thing i can write in another format   maybe in select statement also we can use 
in a sub query what i'm trying to say is   this uh assume you have a one query 
that returns these two distinct values you can have you can have a select class   inside this one also that's what i'm saying 
so for that let me prepare that query first and occupation equal to english 
observation equal to profession see uh let us see what are the distinct values 
we are getting in english education for the   occupation equal to proportion testing so we get so all the professionals have did   all the five categories okay so 
even you can mention this one here i'm just moving it forward so that um i mean 
towards the right okay so you see the query   so this will return my customers and it says 
like whoever did the english education and   english education in this will this should written 
list of only those values english education i mean   some values over this should written only single 
column this should not return multiple columns if   i say like uh english occupation it will throw 
me at code this is nothing but your sub queries only one expression can be specified in the 
select list when the sub query is not introduced   with exist forget about this it says like only 
one column it is expecting okay if you specify   multiple columns it will throw error so basically 
either you can specify it in a list of values are   you can specify a query okay that will return list 
of values so that it will automatically picks up   you got it so that is what working with basic sub 
queries it's as simple as that you got it guys hello i've been listening operators that's good good 
good so uh i hope i am clear with the inoperator   when to use so inoperator to filter list of values 
you see like you cannot have our condition here so   you might have thought like instead of r 
i used incondition so in condition is used   so this and this will return same if you have a 
single values that you whatever values you know   you can put it like this but in this you don't 
know what are the list of values it is going   to return english education but this value 
whatever it is going to return it depends upon   the another sub query this query result based on 
the filters so in that case it will be very useful   so you cannot compare these two so when to use so 
if you don't know the prediction of output then   you go for the statement in statement if you know 
the exact values you can keep adding the r and   whatever the values you have so it's the way you 
have to query you need to know when to use this   such a queries okay so with this note we stop 
operators let's uh move on to our next topic   aggregation functions okay so any idea guys 
when when we use this aggregation functions an area no so let me ask this question so how many of 
you used pivot tables in excel favorite table any idea no idea hello table uses used but not much now 
sometime back yeah some time back okay so what is excuse for we can sort out the data according right   it's like it's a number of data with uh like we 
can have the whatever we need in the pivot table   it's like uh okay we getting the whatever 
data we need in short form not searching   short form see you guys know about pivot 
table but you are not coming actual point okay   the thing is let me explain to you guys so 
forget about those things thanks for your   answers and so i copied the customer data 
once again here i'm going to do a pivot now the idea behind the pivot table is like you want 
to see the data in aggregated manner see as a   company executive or managers they want to see the 
data at the higher level say for example you are   running some supermarket so at the end of the day 
each day you want to see the total sales and you   are having different shops say for example three 
shops so you need to know how what is the sales of   these three shops all together in a single day 
so aggregate level you know no need to see in   detail each time okay at the at a given shot in a 
single day you want to say what is my total sales   correct so these are nothing but your aggregates 
total sum so nothing but if you see here assume   this is your customer data i want to see uh 
what is the salary total income okay total   yearly income of all the bachelors i want to see 
what is the total income of the professionals   in my customers our management students in my 
customers total income okay so are how much   they are spending how what is the salary okay i 
assume these are some kind of employees instead of   customer you forget about the customer perspective 
you'll stick to this salary perspective this is   the employee information so employees uh role is 
profession and he did he's a management profession   and he did some cada or education like that okay 
now i want to analyze how much i am spending for   a profession something like that so i have a 
base data here let me search for profession come on it starts with whatever english occupation okay so when i put it it's not sorting 
actually okay someone said it's a sorting   it's not actually it's like grouping so what 
are the distinct values it have against which   what you want to see i want to see the salary 
what is the salary column here uh yearly income so if you see here total yearly income i am 
spending for an employee who is a profession   this is my total yearly income skilled manual 
this is my total income i mean total uh i'm   paying for the skilled manuals and whoever is in 
management for them i'm paying this much this is   the yearly income of it so you are aggregating 
the data assume you have four employees   someone is getting twenty thousand thirty thousand 
fifty thousand you add twenty thirty fifty and   another guy uh twenty so two twenties thirty 
50 with which will be like 110 okay 20 1000 30 000 and you are paying 40 000 
50 000 20 000. so these are your   three employees so what is your total 
employee expense it's like one lakh one lakh ten thousand so if you see 
here unlike twenty thousand sorry   my calculation is so power so one lakh twenty 
thousand i am spending for my employee salary   now assume these guys two guys are your supervisor okay these two guys are supervisors 
and these two guys are cash here assume like that okay so if i want to see how 
much i am spending for a cache here i will sum   these two if i want to spend how i mean i want 
to analyze these two which is 50. so it's like   grouping of certain values certain columns and 
you want to see this summarize results of it   this is what your pivot table does this 
is the main purpose of your pivot table   so what operation it does here some instead of 
that i can go and do the other aggregation value   see summarize value field i can go and check how 
many persons count if i put count it will give me   the count of employees in clerical there are 123 
employees in management 159 employees in manual   90. so it just says aggregate values and 
i want whoever is getting maximum salary   in clerical i'm getting i mean someone is getting 
40 000 he is the maximum let us go and check   how this is correct or not okay let's do some 
research i mean not a research just filter it out   so i i'll go here okay let's 
filter okay i will go and query it employ hey come on what is the 
column name english occasion english occupation uh english occupation equal to clerical okay i'll just i filtered the data clerical and i will try 
to i'm saying the maximum salary in clerical   is 40 000. whether it's true or not how 
can i find i can put like this order by   yearly income descending as 
earning descending there you go so 40. so there are a lot of people who get 
40 so it doesn't give me a ranking basis   which is whichever is maximum in that column for 
clerical it will give me 40 that is what you got   40 here so let me change it to management 177 that is what you are getting here okay and now 
i will slightly change the query like uh i will   remove this guy see now what happens i put max 
i'll remove this guy so what happens it will pick   me who this is the guy who is getting the maximum 
salary across entire department irrespective of   the department so let us see without this 
fair condition this is what it's happening   so this is the maximum salary you got it guys 
so these two guys are getting maximum salary   so basically a pivot table will give you the 
aggregated results the high level information to   group based on particular column and you need to 
do what aggregations you want to perform so basic   level of aggregation sum average minimum maximum 
count these are the phi aggregation functions you   can perform some count average minimum max okay 
uh these are all uh belong to excel so in um   in sql we will perform these three so all these 
things are a conventional one whatever you see   in excel that will be applicable here how 
you work in sql that's we are going to see so same results i want to get it now here what 
i am seeing here so just choose value field   sum it becomes same results i am going to get 
it now so now instead of filtering to management   all those things so if i filter through one 
particular category it will give me all the   results i cannot analyze using the 5 000 records 
as 6000 records just i want to use group by   group by what column english occupation that you 
need to specify the column name okay and whatever   column name you are specifying here in the group 
by you need to put it in the select statement   okay if the star won't work out 
if you see i can put it like this   it will throw me error if i put like this 
then fine then okay now this is incomplete   what aggregation i want to perform i want 
to perform some on based on yearly income as you see like this is the 
derived column i'm using some uh   i mean i'm using a function here similarly we use 
the string functions yesterday is now something   same thing your place so you need to give a 
alice name so i will say occupation income now forget about this so it is not ordered ordered by 
order by should come at the end   critical clerical same results it's not showing 
us the same results sum of yearly income   since i i may not copy the 
entire content let's see so how many ah yeah see basically it contains 
only the top thousand records case i copied   only 1000 records here i did i had queried 
for all the records so let me do it for that   you gotta write the difference okay if you want i will copy and put it here see eighteen thousand and based on 
this i will create another pivot table english occupation so so 892 and 
you have a same results here 892   82839 here two eight three 
nine okay eight management guys so this is what uh it is basically does so 
basically if you want to group based on a certain   column you use group by then aggregate function 
what are the aggregate functions it can have   you can have some count how many rows in that 
particular column you can specify any column here   no need to specify count of uh early column if 
it is if it is a count you can specify any column if it is sum what column you want to sum yearly max max of uh yearly income you can put   multiple uh cases it's just 
like deriving a new column here okay now so this is cnt this is maximum occupation occupation and minimum occupation okay so now you see like for clerical this is this 
total amount i'm spending and in this two nine two   eight employees are there and in clerical someone 
is getting forty thousand someone is getting ten   thousand so as an aggregated level i can see in 
a single report as summarized report here okay so   basically this grouper is very essential part when 
you take reports now this is fine so what about   like now based on the computer results from 
this i want to filter certain things like   whoever is getting maximum salary in in any of 
this group the salary greater than thirty thousand   okay or fifty thousand say for example fifty 
thousand some scenarios will come you just   choose the maximum salary and from that whoever 
is getting the 50 000 filter those groups alone   okay like that scenario will come so here 
you can't use the where condition over here   where uh salary maxims they are asking 
only the maximum salary is greater than 50   000 okay so after computation you want 
to filter means you need to have having same that's having sum of 
yearly income okay greater than 50 000. now what happens you computed the result 
okay then this will exclude this guy and this guy   because these two records doesn't have great 
this condition failure because of this rule   the salary or the maximum salary should be 
greater than 50 000 so these two will be neglected oh am i wrong okay sorry this is not a yearly see   early say i put having sum of yearly 
income sum of yearly income is this column   which is greater than 50 000 so only come i need 
to put this condition that is max of yearly income so you need to choose appropriate 
function now filtered out okay   any confusion here now i'm going to start 
a interesting part guys about joins okay so now i'm going to start a interesting part   guys about the joins okay can you go for join 
join is nothing but you will join two tables so when you will go for it no answers okay fine let me not only comparison there might 
be a situation we need to compare also we need to uh we need to use the joints 
right with the common column name from that we can   combine the table and get the data yeah you 
we saw about primary key and foreign key   so in that case you need to get the product 
information the purchase you remember the customer   constraint or customer master and customer 
purchase so in order to retrieve so you need some   information from other tables you need to join 
okay this is the thumb rule so in after joining   you want to apply some condition as 
praveen highlighted yes you need to do it   that is fine so basically join is required because 
you need to get information from another table   that is why you are joining that is a 
thing as simple as that okay with this note let me open joins so i have got uh two tables here one 
is uh customer and another one is   customer info okay these are two tables i 
highlighted in yellow and another one highlighted   in blue these are two tables okay now basically 
i want uh location information for the customers   that's why i need to join in this 
table to get the customer location   now what is left join in a join right join full 
auto join let us see in this picture so left join   means i use this one as the base table and this 
is my table so this will include all the records   okay all the records from the left hand 
side table then whatever is matching that is   for 1 is from chennai for 2 is from delhi for 
3 there is no matching record so the result set   is null and for four you have bangalore fine 
what about these two guys i mean five and six   since it is left join this will include only 
all the records from the left hand side table   it will ignore what are the extra records in your 
right hand side table it doesn't matter to it   so this is your left join will perform okay and inner join or join people will say like when 
you do yeah how do we classify which one is left   now you try to understand lift joint 
inner joint right join and we need to   use appropriately when you understand the 
electron right and inner join okay then   you need to query while querying you will decide 
which join to use whether it should be you   we need to use inner join whether we need to 
use left join that you will decide okay okay   but if now i you try to understand what is 
left join what is in a joint what is right   join for now then while uh querying we will see 
you will understand when to use this one okay okay please note in a join so in a join 
like it should match both the sides the   record should exist on both the sides 
so that data will come here you see like   for 1 it is there for 2 it is there and for 3 
there is no record exist here so it will skip   this record itself okay now for four you have 
bangalore so this is your record so these two   columns from this table and these two columns from 
this table i mean these two columns from this trip   so this is your inner join 
so both tables should match right join like um asset it will include all the 
records from your right hand side table   and matching records from your left table that is   for 1 2 and 4 only five and six there is no 
records here so it will populate null there is no   for three me is scripted here since it's the 
right join right join means it will include   all the records only matching records 
from left table this is your right join then a scenario like full outer join 
full letter join which includes both   whatever in your left hand side table 
everything four records and whatever in   your right hand side table five records 
so if it is not matching it will throw   i mean it will have null values for this it is 
having uh not matching left so it will have null   values this is your full outer join this is about 
joints guys any questions in this it's clear now hello can you explain the full outer join yes so all i did not understand anything oh who is this i mean pk from web one ravine private okay fine you change the 
name okay fine first i'll explain the full   auto join and i will explain uh the other things 
once again so full outer join so basically as   i said forget about this thing guys okay 
forget about this i can't hide it hold on i'll hide it here okay now you see this is your tables 
okay customer and customer info   so now you tell me what is the location of gunaan location of guna hello guys 
you can unmute one at a time it's chennai but daniel it's delhi so this is 
what you want basically you want a location   means you have to go and join the customer info 
to get the location whoever has a location they   will get based on the match if they don't have a 
location then they have a null so basically null sorry okay this is what you are expecting for a join as i said join is required only when 
you need to get information from some other table   now i need a location information so i will go 
and pick it up and i will fetch it as a result now   how to do that you can do multiple joins okay   what happens i need all the employees i mean 
all the customers okay only having a location i mean to say if the if we contains null values 
don't show him then i need to use the inner join   what inner join will do it will 
go and check here if it is there   these two guys will come and this guy will also 
come i mean to say these two guys will come and this guy will come because 
it doesn't have a location okay so you skip the record if there is no matching 
record you need to skip if the question is like   that if the request is i need those customers 
who is having a location okay then you need   to do in a join what is the inner join here 
if you see now i bring the inner join first okay so in a join as expected one abi chennai 
to daniel delhi for gonna bangalore so these   three records ask him when i ask i need only 
the customers having a location so then you   need to perform inner join okay now people ask 
a question like i need all the customers whether   if they have a location bring them if they 
don't have a location show them a null or   default it's something else whatever they can 
ask okay i need all the customers but if they   have a location bring them if they don't have 
show me null okay if the question is like this   then i will show all the guys 
and along with the location if   it doesn't have it will show 
null then i need to use left join so what happened here i brought all the 
customers okay what happened here i introduced about all the customers 
then whose location is here and customer location is null for me but i 
need to have all the customers i i should   not lose my customer information because not 
having a location i need to count if i count   this is my query output if i count this 
one it will give me proper customer count   for count if i count this one i will skip the 
customer count i will show only the three count   but it is which is not correct but if the question 
is like that then you need to use inner join   it is always safer to use left 
joint but based on the situation   you need to choose between the joints either 
you need to use inner join or left join okay if there are too many data then we can decide 
them we can use left join or not because some uh   customer ready will not have 
another location doesn't matter   see data doesn't you are saying uh here you want   too many data or multiple records or too many 
data means which you mean multiple columns no no the left join the customer id3 as emi and 
location is null so uh we're not sure uh whatever   uh the data is having now so you know data is 
not null is not null there is no data at all see   simple as that they are asking i 
need locations for all customers   where you are storing your location you are 
storing it here so what you do you go here   and pick up all the locations based on the 
join but the location for amy is not there   it can be a scenario like amy does not provided 
you the location she has given only her name she   didn't provide a relocation that is fine it is a 
valid business case based on your database design   she refused to give her location so there won't be 
entry here so she didn't provide you the location okay so uh what's your question in this okay yeah yeah that is what so it is not mandatory 
that you need to have a location or something   it's based on the business name this table can 
be anything for simple understanding of this   this is the thumb rule used for any complex 
uh joints i mean complex tables also okay fine so right join is same as like that so it will include all the columns mostly 
mostly 99 percentage you will use only these two   right john won't be the case for most of the cases 
because either you will use all the records to be   fetched from your left hand table and you need 
any other further information you go for join   that is the thumb rule usually for joints okay 
you use lift joint or inner join and right join is   typical case it's good to know like you need all 
the locations to be there and whichever customers   you map something like this you got the point 
it is vice versa okay if you have this guy here   i mean this swap if you use this one as a left 
table then this is nothing but your left join   let me explain that later now already already 
got confused so i don't want to confuse again full outer join on our contrast you will have 
both the information all the elements in your   left hand table will be there whatever matching it 
will come and whatever you have here i mean right   and say table everything will be displayed i mean 
in your query and with your null values whatever   matching in the left side that is your full 
outer choice this is the case guys okay let us   try to query it with our customer and customer 
constraint purchase table how it works so here again we have two piece of 
information whether we have created um   i think we have created 
this one right what happened so primary key for nk right yeah all 
right we don't have any uh not since c   this scenario will not happen for me okay you 
have entry there won't be any cases this is   fine this is fine absolutely fine yeah uh okay 
what i'm trying to say is for four there is no   entry okay when we do the left join now i 
will say like how to do all these things   i want what are the items now you see guys 
i explained only with one example for abby i   want only the location okay here i want what 
are the things he purchased john purchase   biscuit paste bottle so i need customer id john 
it will repeat three times now let me show that select start from let's join see now i take this particular customer 
master customer constraint as my base table base   table okay and i'm using it as a left hand side 
table left join with customer purchase table okay as i said i can give   alice name to make it otherwise i need to use the 
three naming convention schema name table name   and column name to join okay instead 
i will give alice name as master and this one is transaction let join on okay this is the 
syntax so this is my first table   left to join with the right hand side table and 
giving my alice name based on what i want to join   from master table customer id and in 
transaction table again a customer id okay now see always a result of a join is again 
a table so you have a table here separately you   have a sample name separately that is why i 
put a combined together once you have a join   here both the tables will combine once you link 
these two both tables will combine and give you   another table so from here you can do any where 
condition i want only daily means so i want only   the daily customers then do the join then filter 
with delhi so it will first evaluate this result   then it will filter only this guy this is 
how it works now let's see that one now   uh when i do this so from here the columns are 
conflicting i mean here also customer id the here   also customer id you need to specify which column 
to specify here in order master dot customer id   i want uh master dot customer name comma here this is enough i want uh these two 
guys i mean here customer id and customer name   and whatever he purchased biscuit 
paste and bottle that is what i want   so that that data exists transaction dot product that's all so i want these guys that's all you are done left join customer id 
and whatever columns you want you get it here   so john has got multiple things let's see why yeah he has purchased once again in bottom and 
we have entered another two records so totally   he has got four or five purchases let us see 
all three together then you get a good idea all right sorry yeah so here you see the three records for john 
and another two records over here so for john   biscuit paste portal these three records then 
biscuit paste again these three records instead   of that to distinguish what is this what is this 
record you need to have this row id to clarify transaction dot okay you see here for john this 9 10 11 and your 
1920 1920. so john has purchased these things   now you got the entire thing abdullah 
chocolate biscuits now in this   you have a left joint which says like i 
included all the records all the customers   so i got one two four and five and 
whatever the matching records in my   transaction table right hand side table all the 
matching records for this guy it will be repeated   so i it's not a duplicate you cannot say it's a 
duplicate it is actual typical requirement because   what are the purchases made by john john has 
purchased biscuit paste bottle biscuit paste again   and based on this transaction id i have brought 
everything this is not you say it as a duplicate   this is actual thing the purchase flow okay this 
is the purchase of the bill you consider like that   now you see the null record here why 
he is a customer but he didn't have   any purchase record over here that is why 
you don't find any records in this table   so it turns to be null this is your left join 
so which includes all the matching records   now in case i do the inner join what it will do 
whatever is matched those things only it will   pick it up this is your output table so this 
one this one particular record will be skipped   let us try that one so nothing to do 
any much changes here just put in a join   replace let's keep this one let's copy let's do it as inner let's do all together we'll see everything so this is your first table 
this is your transaction table   left join gives me another record 
for him and uh here you see   only eight records the fourth record 
got missed okay this is your inner join so this is the purpose of join guys hello there and you say right join here same result it will include all the records whatever is match 
you will get all the records since i imposed   a foreign key constraint you cannot 
have a record without having that case   okay that is why you don't find anything 
else but it will have a matching case here you focus on left join and inner 
join that's more than enough   don't confuse with other 
joints but it's good to know any clarification required guys joins is fine you 
got it very clear until you practice you it will   it will be really difficult to understand you 
need to figure it out oh this is what it is   okay you need to ensure that one now let's take one table uh which 
is having uh multiple joints   so that we can go forward for that i need some table here so just have a look at this data so this is nothing but your internet sales what 
it has is like um you have order number then you   have a unit price how much it is and our quantity 
quantity is one two or three something like that   okay then what is the product everything 
now this is typically which is a customer   as a as we created um primary foreign key we 
already discussed that one now you see here i will go to our table first then i'll show you 
how it looks like the keys what we have created so customer constraint is our master table the 
primary key will look as a golden color okay   gold and color key this is your primary key if you 
guys forgot about the syntax i'm in the structure   definition of it just have a look right click 
everything is right click and you see new so this   is the structure customer id i created here so it 
will create like this if you the proper definition   primary key cluster custard customer id okay this 
is your primary key customer id now i have created   foreign key foreign key will look in a silver 
okay silver color primary key golden color foreign identification so customer id here they set   alter table with check add 
will check see i told you once a check foreign so that is what it said we 
will check add foreign key customer id in   the purchase table okay references 
this particular customer constraint   this is the way it will be created 
now moving on to our example here to explain the joints i want to take 
internet sales fact internet sales   this table has this indicates the 
silver key indicates a foreign key   and these two combination will make you we already 
discussed primary key can be a combination of   columns so these two indicates your uh primary see 
guys you have uh from the column name itself you   can identify sales order number okay people 
will have order number or bill number and   in each bill you have a line number if i go to 
supermarket i will purchase at least 10 items   so say for example number 120 bill number 120 will 
have 10 items so bill number 120 will be repeating   here so that's why i add line number also 
line number will be all those 10 items will be   unique so you have both the things together to 
make it unique that is why you have a time making   so this is your fact internet sales and you as we 
defined earlier what is the purpose of foreign key   you have a product information stored in your 
master table product master so you no need to   repeat those information again here so just 
refer the product key in your sales transaction   so all other information can be fetched 
from here so product t is a primary key here   so these are the product information i have what is the product name 
yeah here adjustable raise   channing ground raise something like 
that okay everything will be here now i have a product product sub category where is that product and sub 
category it's not okay fine okay now the question uh based on the 
different question we'll try to answer using   our sql joins now i just explain the table 
structure now let's have some uh questions   that needs to be answered okay now i have this 
sales transaction i have a customer let's go   for a customer let's see some field here okay i 
need uh um customers who are purchased over 1970s   or 1970 period whatever period we have the 
sales date is like 2010 so we will consider the   2010 date in 2010 december i need those 
customer names this is for question what you need to do now you need to 
understand what are the different tables you   going to work on i need customer 
name correct so either i can use but   the question is says like i need a customer name 
during whoever purchased december 2010 now in this   you tell me guys what are the tables 
involved one is fact internet sales correct now in this which one to use left join   and which one to use right i need 
these two tables now i given a clue any yes it's there just because you have only two options which one you use left which one to 
use right i need list of customer name hello there you need to use right right no no i'm 
asking i need customers during december 2010   that's all simple as that okay you i 
need to tell me which one i need to use   i need to use join because the condition says if 
they ask only the customer list of names i need   list of customer names then i will copy only this 
table okay but they asked me whoever purchased   during december 2010 they asked only the customer 
name i will get the distinct values of this name   that's fine only one table is enough but they 
ask me whoever purchased during december 2010 so i'm asking i need to use a join here i need 
line so inner join left join and if it is a left   join which one i need to use first whether i need 
to use a dim customer table inner and inner join like this r and i need to use like this 
option one or option two option one option two option two option two and one are same if i 
use in a join so you can either   use either of the cases if you use inner 
join the problem comes only with the left join you need to understand the 
difference forget about now i will go   for option two as raheel island because 
he worked most on uh these problems so so i need to filter the dates so first of all fact 
internet sales i will keep it as a transaction   and this one is customer and i use so this will 
include all the records from this table so first   have a count of records here this will be 
little confusing for you guys query like this so the total count is sixty thousand three 
ninety eight this includes all the records from   the this table now let's join on transaction dot 
customer key equal to customer dot customer key   again when i select star you 
look at the account 60 398. that takes some time mute okay again 60 000 398 this is fine so there is no 
duplication now you have joined both the tables   what will be the output now what is happening here 
like you consider this is your transaction table   and this is your customer table so you are trying 
to do the left join now so this is your output   you have got so is there any increase in the data 
it is same because you have six records you have   got all the six records since you use slip join 
so i'm trying to plan with the small examples   if you work with the large data it is same now 
what happened you combine these two table data   like this so once you make a join this star 
indicates all the columns from your internet sales   all the columns from dim customer has combined 
here so if you see here what is the last column   only i'm selecting the fat internet sales   ship date is your last column 
if i select along with this you see after shift date is that guy   yeah after shift date the customer key started 
customer key is from dim customer table okay so this is your output now whichever 
has a map that will have a mapping record   if some customer information is 
missing in the master you will have   null records here this is not the null you 
need to you should not look at null means   this null always whatever you are joining with 
this column customer key should not be null okay okay there is no null columns because all 
the customers exist here forget about that   okay guys now back to our question now i need 
only the name where the name exists customer   dot let's make it simple as like first name 
alone then this is your requirement then i   didn't filter it so i need to filter where 
transaction dot sales date or order date some other function as well okay here or a date okay order date equal to or i can use between 2012 0 1. and 2010 to 31 okay this answered 
so i need list of customers   who was brought the items during december 2010 so only 14 customers okay has 
brought the items during this month   this is same like corona who whoever came from 
immigration they will find a query like this only   so after some period whoever came and along 
with their address i want so just put address   address line one so they will come up with 
you after having address that's all okay   this is how you will query it during the 
list of customers based on different periods   whatever period you want you will need to put 
it in a bad condition so basically we started   the select statement with wire condition in a 
single table don't confuse with the condition   with joints when you use what columns to use 
once you have a joint you output is nothing but   another new table new table so from this 
you are going to query that's all okay i hope i'm clear guys now let us see this example okay like i want 
to filter out when i do a f join   i want to filter out who are whose 
customer information is missing   in this thing okay you can do it in multiple ways 
i can do it in the left join but not to do that let us take a simple case customer key whatever six zero three nine eight all the customers oh only this question what 
happened oh this is the transaction count   what i'm trying to check is whether all customers 
exist here or not that's what i want to check i want to delete one particular customer 
key from this record let us take this guy delete from this table the 
customer key equal to this what happen incorrect syntax 
now i think this is not prepared see it says conflicted with 
the reference constraint i there is some other uh direction 
called the reference constraint   packed internal cells not sure maybe give me a minute i'm trying to give you a scenario 
where you can understand very better   uh let us delete this guy delete customer 
key what reference constraints just not sure okay let me delete this if i'm not able to 
delete i don't want to fix this one right now   let us focus on something else sales order number now okay i'm moving back to our example i want these two tables now so i want you to understand the joints as 
much as possible then only sql will work out okay now you see here guys so one two 
one five and we have 4 is missing here   so when i do a inner join select star from join customer purchase i will keep the allies name as a for time being 
i will put a and b a dot um study equal to so what i want actually i want 
only aid at cast id and i want aged one more time yeah s is nothing 
but your uh alternate name see   when i you need to instruct this join 
this column i mean from this table this   particular column customer id when i use 
i need to explicitly specify like this   the big uh table name so once you give the alias 
name once you start giving the list name then you   can refer using that alias name instead of 
giving this table name just i'll put a dot for praveen we are calling chin to right 
so same thing applies going forward we   will refer into uh instead of calling him 
praveen same thing alice name short name   like that i mean not a short 
name it is like uh aliyah's name like nickname exactly so nickname uh in 
technically it is like alias okay so you are   keeping a and for this b going forward i can refer 
using a wherever i say a in this query only okay   not other queries only in this query the scope 
is within this query so it had customer id beta   customer id so b indicates this table a indicates 
this table okay now what i'm trying to say is so   it will skip the fifth record i mean uh therefore 
kumar since the customer id does not exist   now what i want you to see here is 
when i do the left join what happens sometimes there is some cases so this is the i 
will if you see the output like this you can't   get it so always run along with your base 
tables and the result i mean the query so   this is your base table a and b and you are using 
a left join so it includes all the records here   left all the records in the sense all the members 
then if it can't the right side table it contains   multiple records it is repeated okay so if 
i have a row id then you will understand b dot row id so beta draw id is nothing but you have 
distinct records here uh 9 10 11 19 20 9 10 11   19 20 for customer id now there is some cases 
like um we have a customer and people will ask   whoever doesn't purchase retal we have customers 
or we have one product that doesn't sold   in our list okay something like 
that you consider this as a product   and this is your transaction then there will 
be some cases like you there people will ask   whichever has not sold at 
all then this is the case   so this particular product okay our customer who 
has not purchased at all but he is a our customer   then how to filter it so you got the result 
here then what you need to do just put where where this column exists row id right row 
id or product anything any column you need   to specify so these two columns are from b 
table so you put b dot row id is null because   where condition uh we have seen about equal to 
greater than less than less than equal to between   like in all those things okay so for in 
order to filter a null value we cannot   specify equal to null this will not work 
out this is not this will return false only   so for null values to filter is null okay 
now you see i will have that condition i'll have all the outputs together so when you select you can comment it out now you see the output guys so this is your first table second table 
when i do the left join it includes all the   products from the left table and whatever 
appeared then the next query i approved   this is like whichever customer 
who doesn't purchased at all so   we can get the results like this okay so 
this is how they will try to analyze and   business will ask lot of questions most of 
them are adapt questions so these kind of   stuffs you keep it ready these queries you will 
run that one you will get that queries answered   okay this is the main important thing so you just 
know you just not use the joins only for joining   as i said joins is used for looking information 
in another table that is absolutely correct   but uh in this case you are looking information 
for another table that is not exist the doesn't   purchase then you need to look up then only you 
know that he doesn't purchase so obviously you   are looking up information then only you know that 
is not purchased so you got this answer okay guys this is what very important when you use joins 
when to use where to use so there is no uh thumb   rule like which one to use which table to use 
as left or right it depends upon the scenario   let me show you guys so now you have a count 
of records four records now and this one have something around eight or ten records eight records okay so when you run together   four and eight so when you use this one with this 
you are increasing the records okay when you use   inner join i mean this one totally you will get 
maximum of uh eight records how come it's nine   okay this one has uh left join it included all okay so inner join always will have only the 
matching records okay left join will give you   different results so there is no count you 
cannot make based on the data value only   you are saying it now it increase to nine records 
how many records you have in your table that   doesn't decide you how many requests you will 
get there is no duplication nothing you can say   this contents eight so final result 
should be eight not like that okay okay no no uh the point i want to make here is you 
see like um here four records here eight records   but when you use this one as your base 
table okay you will get always eight records   so here i will swap this guy the customer purchase over here why as i swapped it becomes a table 
and this guy will become b table okay now you see the difference between these two   when i when use customer control as a base 
table customer purchase second table and   customer purchase base table and customer 
control in the second table i mean lift now see the results this contain 
four this contain eight so your customer control when you use as a base 
table it gives me nine records but when you use   customer purchase as your base table it gives 
me eight records because it uses a left join it   all includes all the records records in the 
sense all the values it should include all   the values that values is based on this 
particular joining column so it records   and this one since it included all the unique 
values from your customer control that is four   this guy also included that is why 
one extra record is coming in this   customer control when you use 
customer control as your base table okay guys i think uh taken more 
time in joints since this is very   important concept in any skill 
once you have familiar with joints   then you are done you are expert in skill so 
this so left and right doesn't matter you use   use instead of using right join you swap the 
tables and use okay pull join we already seen uh we have one more join called a cell join 
all these things are recovered full join   union outer joins outer join is nothing 
but left outer join right outer chain   join any idea so sir join is nothing but you 
join the same table again for some purpose   okay usually it will be like 
you have i will go to excel when you will use employee id you 
have name you have a manager id   okay this is again a important 
interview question in cts 101 one zero two one zero three one zero four one zero five i have um okay these are employee names assume like that see so each employee has a id and manager id is 
nothing but b's manager i mean b's manager is a   if it is null he is the top most no one has 
above him maybe he is a ceo something like that   so again a can be a c um b okay so if the data maintain 
like this so what it indicates is like   so these two information it's easy to understand 
so or not one is employee his name is a b c d and   the same information the manager id okay manager 
id is nothing but maybe name uh insured i need to   use ide right so it should be one not one and here 
it should be again one not one here it should be   like one or three here it should be one or two 
okay so manager id means so for b a is the manager   for c a is the manager for d c is the manager 
for e b is a manager in this case i want name of a manager i mean i i want this result like this name and manager name okay so he doesn't have a manager and for b   it is nothing but a here so a and for d 
it is c and for e it is b you got it guys so this should be the result how you will get 
this result you need to do the join of same table   again okay i mean you need to use the left join 
of uh you will use select start from employee   lift join with select star from employee again and 
you will give a different alice name then you will   get this results okay let me have a let me insert 
this record okay then i will uh try to code it in   you you got this guy this output right this is 
why this is what the expected output you need a   employee id name and manager name but you have 
idea so you need to do this subjoin of the same   table to get the respective description that is 
why you know there is a concept called self join so this is the scenario it is not only 
you should have manager id surf id there   can be a chances any other column you 
want to create i mean you need to fetch   so that the same information available in the 
uh same table so you will do the self join so time now okay i'll try 
to create in five minutes okay create table employee any doubt 
guys in this employee id name   and manager id sorry i didn't 
specify the data type integer back here of 10 and manage your id again integer okay i created then insert values i'm going to do some trick here i don't 
think the trick will work okay it's working okay this is value and here okay be with me guys uh insert into values so i'm   inserting these records as we saw 
in the previous example indexer now okay so you have uh a b c d as an employee okay whose manager ids 
are available here now i want what i want i   want the manager name for b i need to get a here 
for c i need to get a here for d i need to get   c here for e i need to get b here that is the 
output i want now this is the only table i   have so how to do that so consider this 
as a table as left join so now you see   this should be my output column for this sky only 
i need a b c d i don't want anything with this   so from this base table identify this is my a 
table okay left join again with the employee table what i want from the a table you do the 
manage id live join on a dot manager id and from the a table okay what what it does is 
basically if you do the join you have a table   and have a b table so from a table you 
take this column manager id join with   b table this column so obviously 
you will get a b c d against here a   a c and b so this is your a table otherwise first 
table left left table and this is your b table   that is what i am putting a and b okay 
so a dot manager id b dot and employee id okay you see a dot star first you see the output 
then you will get to know b right star uh correct right left join i put only left left 
join on this right now you see so these three   columns from a table and these three columns as 
as i indicated before join will give you a table   format whatever you use the left table for that it 
will add some more columns based on the join you   used left join link there is no one not one i mean 
for him null so there is no records for 101 so   it had these two records repeated here this 
is again this is okay now what you want   so you see guys here employee name manager 
id again employee name manager id so this   name you are giving alice name as manager name 
that's all so let it be a manager id here i want   output b dot name make it as manager name so this 
is like giving allies making it as manager name you see the source data then only you can understand better so understand it guys for uh b employee b 101 is the manager whose name 
is a so a a 103 for d 103 1 r 3 name is c so c   for e 1 2 1 2 is b b here so 
you got to manage your name okay guys so your crucial part in understanding 
sql is understanding your joins if you are   familiar with this class i mean if you 
are confident in this class left join   inner join forget about right join strap 
it this conference will now be recorded so i just want to have a couple of minutes again 
in joints because um people have always have a   confusion and only if you know joints then you can 
say you are expert in sk so yesterday we saw about   left joints i mean i mean we need to use join for 
the purpose of in order to get information from   some other table so let us have a 
refresher session now so you got two tables   now you are doing a left join here to get the 
related information this product whatever he   purchased so is there any rules like how many 
tables we need to join so we we've got here a transaction table fact internet says okay this guy contains all the references like 
customer key and what is the sales territory   key territory is nothing but your region 
so this guy has got only the references   the values are available here so say 
for example i want to get i want to know   this customer what are the products he brought 
and in which location he has brought okay   so this column this column and this column so 
in order to get this particular customer name   and what are the products he has brought and what 
is this location physical location he has brought   so now to get this one i need to join three tables 
to get this information okay so how to do that so obviously we will select 
all those tables here we'll   list down all those tables so this is the 
first table as i said i want a customer i want product i want sales territory okay select star from so usually in order to sense 
the data i mean what data it contains so just put   select top 10 rows atop two rows for now 
to get what are the information we need   so people will ask i want a customer 
information and what products he has brought and   from which location like this only people will ask 
you need to see what information we can provide   some cases it will be specific they will 
provide exact column names what they want   i need customer name i need customer location and 
i need this product category something like that   in some cases they won't provide anything 
you need to grasp all the information okay so this is what you have in this table 
so this is your transaction table the customer   product and what what is the purchase price of 
it and is there any discount amount discount   price percentage product standard cost all those 
things are available here and when it got ordered   when it goes shipped all this information 
is present here this is your transaction   then this is your customer information customer 
information have a name birth date email address   what is this income all those things 
then product product code is there   what is the description of it then sales territory 
it contains the uh country name and group   let us have our in our report we will have a 
customer name and his email address then from   product i need a product name and from region i 
will have a country so these are the things i need   from this transaction for this customer okay first 
of all if the if the people ask like for john v   young i need uh all those information or they 
can ask from united states who are the customers   from uh this particular product adjustable 
rates who are brought so if they ask like   this you need to join all this possible company 
you need to ensure that so back to our question   so for this customer two one seven six eight they 
will not ask like two one seven six eight maybe   we need to find for one particular customer 
what is the two one nine six eight where customer key equal to you can put it in quotes or integer i mean if 
it's indicated no need to put so people will   ask like go for cold air person can you give 
me all this list okay something like this they   will ask a question like this so let us do it in 
inquiry so first of all i need to have this table then join there can be any order this there 
is no specific order here because i want   all the transactions first so i will put all the 
transactions will be included then i do the left of customer so first i will put fact internet 
sales i'll put fct for customer i'll put   cus so i hope you remember what is 
this this is alias name left join on fact sorry fct dot customer key dot customer key now what this will result i i will get a 
transaction details after doing this join   output will be another new table that will 
have all the columns in the fact internal sales   and what are the customer 
attributes of it so customer dot plus dot maybe i will put the customer information first first name middle name last name okay let's keep it like 
this so when i select this one got everything because i i have all the data 
here i didn't filter for this particular customer   when i want to filter with this guy okay 
customer colleague watson i need to split   instead of julia watson i can use the customer 
key and i have already find the customer key here   so i can use that one where customer key equal to this one so now instead of see here it's showing 
error because i got a customer key from fact table   also from customer table so from which 
table you are referring that you need to   say otherwise it will say ambiguous column name 
so you can specify either of them i'll go for customer.customer key equal to this so this guy has purchased only two 
times i mean it's not purchase okay   he purchased twice only two times see the order number it starts with four three   three six and five six two so two times and 
you see the odd date also it is different   2010 he had one entry in 2010 13 only he returned 
back now what are the products he purchased   can you able to get it from here no where that 
information available you have a product key and you have a fact dot territory sales territory so whether you can get those information 
from here i minimize the table um columns   whatever we are focusing on so this guy 
has brought two products and he belongs   to this region so we not to get what is 
this country belongs to first we will go   for product what are these products he has 
brought that information is available in dim product so get these two guys i mean this particular table left 
join so your output table joining with   your output table this is your output 
table join with this product okay left join product on so where is this key 
product key that priority exist in fact product key equal to product dot product key now once you join this one 
what will be the output you see here   product dot star i put all the columns i 
have brought all the columns from product y dot product key oh sorry see i have to filter i mean 
i use i need to use where condition okay now you see for this product key 
this is uh till this it's from fact table   after joining you got for 310 and 600 product what 
is its attributes you got it in a table this is   your left join see left join here will take all 
the inputs from here okay all the inputs what is   the output of this two i mean when you have our 
condition here okay you need to have a condition what happen okay this table doesn't 
include it now see that is the   purpose of your left joint 
so this is your output okay   for these two products okay what is my data so 
you can have multiple data here in your left table   you have only two records but in your right table 
right table is nothing but your product table left table you have only two records in your 
right table you have 600 records it doesn't matter   once you do the join okay it will give you 
the results this is your wire condition see   without this wire condition it does for all 
the records i mean uh all the 60 000 records   for this fact table this bad condition filters 
it if you see if i put this where condition here you got my point what i'm trying to convey is typically this first query is giving 
me 60 000 records all the records   bad condition is filtering for only 
john and the second product table if   i join without wire condition it is 
returning for all the 60 000 records   when you use this where condition it is filtering 
only customer key that is what is happening left join okay now obviously 
you need to have this guy now i got product information i don't 
want anything else except the product   english name so just keep product english name again you run now this is fine so what 
about the territory key territory key is six   again you need to do left join data key is in this table on fct dot sales territory key see let us 
go one step back cell static key is 6 so in   this record in step six what values you need 
you need the country what is the value for   sales state track is equal to c six we will 
see that one sales territory key equal to six so sales territory is six what is the country name 
canada okay canada i am expecting in this output create a dot sales directory key now i didn't see once you join it it 
will not obviously come you need to   select what columns you need okay 
you need to explicitly specify   but internally it has created 
another table with those columns country now you need to query like 
this so now you got canada here   so you use this product keys as a joining 
column once you got the desired output you   can remove those keys keys doesn't 
have any meaningful information okay now this is your final output if they ask for 
cole watson he has purchased these two products   he from the location canada this is your outfit 
so joints there is no restriction that number   of joints you can make it's not only two tables 
from a single table whatever columns it refers   you need to get the missing information in another 
table i mean if the information is missing in the   same table it is in available in another table you 
find the link then you use appropriate choice see   this condition from here fact dot customer 
key customer dot customer key and from here   fact dot product key in dim product dot product 
key from here you have a sales territory key   and dim sales director key this is again a simple 
example for using multiple tables in a joints okay any doubts guys oh great important concept in any skill once 
you have familiar with joints then you are   done you are expert in skill so this so left 
and right doesn't matter you use use instead   of using right join you swap the tables and use 
okay pull join we already seen then we'll see something in self join union all those things okay guys now you see uh customer one and two 
john abdullah all those things now i want to   combine the results of these two okay uh instead 
of this i will have another record inserted insert into one the query maybe 
quickly i will do that things so i'm not specifying the column name here i 
mean instead i will directly put the values so i i taught you about values 
instead you can also have a select one   comma instead of one let's say three another you can specify like this also okay   now what i'm trying to do is like you got 
a customer information uh in two tables   uh table one and table two this kind of 
scenarios will come you have multiple branches   some people will have a branches wise information 
they if their application is legacy system   they use i mean they have information scattered 
in different places at the end they want to match   informations okay now i want to combine and 
see both the customers and there can be chances   like i have a duplication also these two customers 
over here these two customers over here but i want   a unique values are just first of all we will 
see how to combine these two results so you   cannot do the join join means this information 
okay will come to your right side this side this information will come to your 
right side as an attachment to the   existing records it it will again pick you a 
table okay result set but it is attribute it   becomes attribute of this particular column 
if you do the join but when we want to   get the same results as one two four five and 
it should result as three i mean concatenate   the results i i want to add a row i don't 
want to add a column extra column okay   for that you need to use set operations 
like union union so let us do union all so you need to execute as a whole then only 
you will get exact output expected output   so what is the result guys so you have a table one   and this is your table two the combined results 
is nothing but you match the records rows   okay not as a column and again this will result 
to a new table so this is your union all operation   okay and there are some cases like 
i don't want the duplicates so this   5 and 6 and 1 and 2 is exact duplicate in that 
case i don't want duplicate means just you do the   union remove this all condition that will give me the unique values now you see this is union all it combined three 
plus four plus three seven records so seven   and union what happened it skipped the 
duplicates one two one two here it skipped it   and it gave me only the unique records so how 
it skipped all those things this union will   take care the union program has written 
i mean this program is already written   so this is your union and union 
all and there are some cases like you have a customer here and 
you have a customer over here   i want to identify those are not exist 
in b table so i want four and five okay in that case stick to 
this guy i just put accept so what happens from the table one   i i will compare with table two i want those 
who are not existing table two so i got   four and five and if you do the vice 
versa so one and i mean to say i want uh   those who are does not exist from table one i 
mean table what i'm saying is i will use i want   this result from table 2 i want the customer who 
does not exist in table 1 then just stop the table i'll run together so first result is   table one acceptable to second result i mean 
this result is nothing but four and five and   the next query i have written uh table two except 
table one so this resulted me three now go back okay union intersect accept yeah intersected 
in tell you so now we saw about union   union all union all union and accept that is 
something like so it's like a set operation guys   you already understand about set operation you 
have a circle here you have a circle over here   then in between what is a common factor in between 
same thing whatever we have a set operation that   is what is happening in sql how you approach it 
in table level now final thing is like intersect intersect any guesses what it will do without i will not execute 
intersect what is intersect will do hello i'm asking because you guys are watching you guys 
are listening or not so intersect any idea guys no idea so uh earlier we saw like whichever not exist 
in this or either in the table one or table two   uh and we need to combine all those things 
there is sometimes like we need to find   what are the common items in this   two tables so one and two is your common 
items okay so that is what intersect will do so one and two is your result okay this is your intersect okay so let us start sometime querying let's focus 
on some security aspects of it okay now um there   is something like always if we see here this 
is table what about this guys we have something   like before that uh some object is there some 
references there this is nothing but a schema so   schema definition is like um it's like a container 
or a grouping of objects okay so you create a   schema say for example you create a database for a 
college and your college has multiple departments   and you want to store options for each 
department separately or you want to categorize   database tables based on the departments 
so you create schema for each department   and you will add three tables in one department 
or schema you add 10 tables in another department   of schema based on the organization structure okay 
you will segregate the groups underneath you will   create the tables so that is what schema is schema 
is nothing but you are acting as a container to   refer the tables so how to create it so it comes 
under security no it comes under database schema yes so under the database you have 
this is your database security and   schemas if you see here by default you have these 
many schemas okay dbo so all objects if you so   you can ask me so always i should have a schema uh 
yes by default if you are not specifying a schema   if you see our earlier examples of creation of 
scripts just now created some db table scripts   so we didn't specify anything like this okay now 
i have saved from the database even if you are   not specifying all the tables by default it will 
go and sit in your schema so always it follows   three naming convention one is your database name   if if you want to refer your table you 
need to refer using three naming convention   that is your database name schema 
and table name okay this is the order now how to create your user defined 
schemas so if you are not specifying schema   then it will store in dbo and 
you can create your own schema   say for example this is corona i will 
create a schema as virus okay schema owner   uh i'm not sure whom to add let us have 
the peace security admin of over okay so i have a schema called virus 
okay if you want to create a table in this create table virus dot customer so here you already have a script 
right i can take the same script instead of dbo i can create it like um in 
another schema so you can have a same table name okay virus okay let me run this one so when i run 
this one it will say that is already object name   customer control in the database okay when 
you have the same object in the same schema   it will throw error but you can create virus dot 
customer table i hope you can create let us see   yes it does so if you see here in 
the tables now go and check it here refresh it so dbo dot customer db or db 
or dbo now i have created another schema   customer.customer constraint with the same name   so as i said this can be one department 
dbo and virus can be another department customer um i can say severity i want to track   virus severity how many what is the level 
or something like that level level id level id is integer i i'll say just like a level 
name or stage 1 stage 2 this is i'll say stage id stage description now we are in stage 2 in 
india so like that i'm saying so stage one   stage two what is stage two means those 
those information i can maintain it here   i'm creating uh data so refresh it you 
can see a new table okay this is just   easy for us to maintain the tables organize matter 
similarly how you maintain in a folders like   here i maintain this is my recording this is 
my data this is my script under the database   you have tables but you have everything in the 
same schema you need to organize as a folder   so consider you you can refer it as a folder or it 
can be a group something like that okay so schemas   in database perspective it is a schema so all 
other operations is same just it's a schema okay   you you can insert delete all those things with 
these schema name but if you what happens if i   say for example when i try to 
insert without a schema insert into scripts here so without a schema obviously 
it will go and insert in your default schema data i don't think it will have a lot 
of numbers we have added already   okay that's fine so i can insert it now i didn't mention the schema now which table 
it got inserted it got inserted into this 67   john london okay if i want to mention 
explicitly in this table i want to insert   now you select the virus table there 
is no entry i am going to insert it now you need to specify virus dot sorry is dot now i check the virus table now got that entry so 
it's same as any other table so i'm not going to   uh there is no difference in um if you have a 
schema in same table nothing is going to differ   just you need to specify this key 
money okay this is one thing i want to   tell you now another important aspect is like you 
want to secure the tables i want to give access   to only certain people whoever logs in say 
for example i have to give access only to   certain tables uh dim account currency and 
customer okay only these three tables i want   to give access to some users how to do that 
for that i need to have a login created okay new login and he is something 
like account accounts accounts manager our accounts team lead okay accounts 
team lead kind of role i want to give   given as sql authentication so sql authentication 
i give some password keep it secret okay i don't want the password 
explanation so just creating a login here now fine account team lead is your 
login so you need to create a login   this is to using this account only i can 
login into my server this is your server   okay now i need to go to database in this 
database okay i need to create a user username can be same as login 
so a sql user with login okay   username can be account user okay and 
i need to choose that particular login account stimulate okay and for him 
what are the access i want to give hold on no own schemas it's not 
securables okay in securables   you need to add specific objects as i said 
i want to give those objects only tables   you can give any of them only three 
tables are views whatever you want to give   so you choose tables then browse as i said 
i want to give say for example three tables three tables and then press ok then what 
access you want i want to select access i   want only select okay let us see only select 
these three tables i'm giving only select that's all okay account user   let us login using see this login is using my 
admin access i'm going to connect using the the newly created login that 
is account underscore team lead team leader team lead i forgot the name let us see good so here is the login logged in now you 
can see you can still see the database i   need to fix that one now but when it 
tries to expand the other database   it doesn't have access he tries to 
expand it the account team lead okay but   when he tries to expand this one i have given 
the rights he can see only these three tables   this account is my admin account i can 
see all the tables in this adventure works but using this i mean for account team 
lead you can see only the three tables   and even he can only select the tables 
he can select the tables when he tries to   insert or delete the record it will throw 
an error let us try that one delete from dim account see guys when you once you are querying it it is 
taking the uh here you can see the username who is   executing these queries okay so those things 
also is taken into account it's just not   running the query who is running all those 
things so when you try to delete it delete   permission was denied on the object schema 
okay he he doesn't have access to delete the   records he has only have access to select the 
records so this level of this granular level   of access control you are providing so that any 
banking applications like crucial applications   correct so you cannot update your balance sum and 
balance so people will have only access to read   only very crucial people will access to updation 
or correction sometimes we need to manually   correct the name or update the user information 
so this is what they implement the security   so these kind of things you cannot impose it in 
a file system earlier conventional file system   this is very important things to consider okay i 
hope i'm clear guys so you imagine whatever other   roles you can create let's see that one like each 
thing over here as defined schemas has its own i   mean to say ddl you see we saw about ddl right so 
if you give ddl admin he can able to create the   tables he can able to alter the column definition 
those kind of rules so these roles are predefined   by sql server so some like deny data reader deny 
data writer so you cannot insert or update right   means it's not only insert insert update so these 
are different access or roles already created by   a sql server db owner means he has access to all 
i mean db owner can create or modify all the sql   uh tasks he can do but he's not a system admin 
security admin there are certain things even   i'm not sure what are the things these things are 
dba activities as a developer it is good to know   just to highlight some something if you 
find like i don't have access what to do   so you should know they have restricted your 
access okay this is about schemas users and   security so i hope you guys know about your roles 
roles are nothing but again a group you give   some roles of i mean in you create a role and same 
security whatever security restrictions you want   to have you give it for role then you map those 
users because if you create a user for each user   you need to give this security restriction this 
table this table instead if you create a role   you can give whatever access objects 
you need to provide it in a role   just map 10 users into that role it's again 
like a grouping role-based security okay so with this node then what i want to cover is import export   when we start the session someone asked me whether 
we can import data from excel into database   yes we can too that is what i'm going to show 
but for now what i'm trying to do is like   there is a issue in importing an excel 
in my laptop for time being i will import   dot csv file so i have created already a 
purchase csv file here let us have a look it   is nothing but our customer purchase table only 
so same thing maybe i will replicate some data to have a huge records so this contains um 
almost 25 records okay 1918 records including the   18 records excluding the header okay so 
this purchase csv file or excel file in   the procedure is same how to import into a 
database it can be a huge file 1gb file or   whatever can be the thing it should 
be in a table format how to do that so you have a database choose 
where you want to import here you already have customer purchase let us 
do it in virus.customer purchase okay so click   on the database right click okay right click on 
the database you have a task then import data and click on next everything is simple guys 
microsoft has done very good   gui for you you don't need to do any coding all 
those steps just choose then your job is simple choose this guys and uh screen server 
data um choose all files purchase.csv   okay so this is what you have see now this is your 
flat file once you choose that csv it so you all   already understand about the road delimiters 
and column daily road delimiters is the new row   column delimiter what was there in the csv file 
is like csv csv means comma it will be comma   comma comma separated so tabs or commas usually it 
will take and it has created a new table for you   this is the structure row id customer you 
remember i copied and pasted multiple times so 19   it showed you the preview okay so this is your 
source file just showing your preview this is   what you're going to get because there will be 
some issues sometimes you need you can fix it   this column might come here this might 
went there so just ensuring it's correct now what is your target target is my database 
microsoft odp provider for sql server and   this is my server name you i can go for windows 
authentication since i choose the database already   and right click from there so it is showing 
me the correct database then you click on next   so it suggests some name based on the file name 
okay i don't want this name just go and do it in   purchase now virus or schema and purchase import 
and name it as input so now we don't have any   tables you know this point guys okay i mean what 
i'm trying to say is here i don't have any target   table so either you can have a table created 
by you manually so that you can map otherwise   this will create you a table for you okay 
now you can see the edit mappings here   edit sql here so this is the structure it's 
going to create wireless dot purchase import   row id customer id product quantity price 
based on the metadata you didn't provide   anything there see it will sense the data 
so how it created the data type you didn't   provide anything so it by default it 
created with our care of 50 5050 okay simple as that if you have a data in file or 
excel just import it that will be very simple   any doubts in this guy's case if we have a live database okay office okay 
when we import those data do we restrict   that no it's not be done by everybody um no 
what's yeah yeah that is what see that is what see   importing is one part okay you imported you 
created a physical table as an admin you should   have access to it now you can restrict this is the 
table right you can restrict to some users so not   all users can login and direct data that's what 
i told in the previous point you can create the   read access only to this and you do not show this 
table at all you don't give rights to read or   write anything okay so those users have that right 
only can see it well if the user can if the users   have had the data in excel if they're adding 
importing will they do or we can restrict the importing the data to be done 
only with the respective users now you are saying who can import the 
data that's correct right so it it's again   whoever has access let us try with this guy 
he don't have an import access i think anyways uh so using him i can't do let us try quickly he 
can't do it it will throw error for him okay   look my answer let us quickly check what 
happens for him i'm using another user purchase csv next i'll go quickly next next next 
okay first time for time being i put everything it's executed oh i'm sorry then something 
has some security rights are given to him   that is why it got executed okay 
that user so you can restrict   but it has written somewhere else maybe 
it created from something else not here so   the rights i have created has not given him 
a right to see the table you still see here   it has created a table here but he can see that in 
adventure works he has created he can see this one that that is doable to answer your question simply 
it is duplicate you got a purchase table here so   yeah that is based on the security 
rates okay uh this is one thing   then linker server i especially put here to make 
you to understand what is link service yeah when   you import the data will this also include the 
column name or because it's inside whatever we   have included in according to which it's split 
into a column wise so the column uh names will they choose or yeah see it that is a built-in 
functionality so column names you have given as a   top order in the top okay you should have a 
top column and you will specify like first   column as uh row i mean first row as a column 
name some options will be there to specify so   based on the tab delimiter here you have tab 
delimited that is it picked up automatically   you can even correct it sometimes it 
will be like this or sometimes the   separator will be like this so you need 
to specify you can specify that one okay okay so based on your data you can edit it so this is about your import and link server i 
have created because see linked server concept   is very simple you have a server here you 
have a database you can talk with different   databases between this i mean in the same server 
i can query a table from here in this database   like here i have select star see here i have 
adventure works database i'm querying the table in another database okay so i can query using three 
naming convention database name and what about if you have a   database or table to be accessed from different 
server say for example you have a server i mean   deepak has installed the uh his own uh system 
i mean sql server that as i said dbm must   sql server was a dbms he yes in his laptop i'm 
having this table i want to combine a table from   deepak's laptop into my laptop i want to query 
it i can i want to see it so what i will do is so this is again some rare cases 
you will create a new linked server   i will give the deepak server name and both 
should talk okay there should not be any firewall   or other issues so your system should enable 
to read my system to accept the server request   so those things you can mention it here 
server name then it's like again you can   use instead of this database name you also have 
another dot like you have a link server name   i don't have another server here i can't 
talk to the server so link server name dot   database you got it right so just a link 
server is nothing but you have a database in   another servers you want to access in 
your environment you need to create   a link server okay then only you can 
able to access it this is what okay   so this is about your link server 
then one important aspect i want to   cover is like a profiler it's very crucial 
guys most of them won't use it very important   concept to learn so what is a profiler 
so profiler is a separate tool   data profiler now it's not a data profiler it's 
your sql server profiler sql server profile so what it will do is like as the name indicates 
is the part of dbms and it will give all your   activities inside the dbms you see like in a 
windows profiler you have logs whoever logs in   whoever logs out and what activities you did you 
created a table and you created a file you watched   a movie some windows player has went those logs 
will be tracked similarly if you run your profiler   only if you run it okay all the activities happen 
in the database will be logged here so you can   see that things so whoever has deleted 
some records you have deleted which user   has deleted which user has modified so that you 
can easily track you can identify that person   what is this thing track so 
basically for all purpose sql server profiler yeah yeah so you see if 
you enable it it will log but you can see   what is happening here what queries it 
is fired in the runtime when you hit   some applications what queries it came from 
the client application what queries it has   written the results those things will come 
here so just you need to see all the events   in database level all those things let us see 
what important here is i think uh database   let's see okay i'll choose all columns 
all uh things just keep it like this okay   now you have uh everything 
over here just i run this query so that will be available over here so i have 
run that query sql batch completed select start   from link server since this doesn't have any link 
server so i throw it error now i run that query   you see here without that   link so it has written so what queries are 
keep on firing whoever logs in if i log in the activity also will be tracked 
system admin edition what skills   or all those things who are logged in adm 
connection edition so this is the events   which will tell you something is going wrong 
someone has goes and deleted and which user has   deleted it will keep track so login name who has 
logged in who has done the changes we can pack it   so people can't say i have deleted no i don't 
know who did that so this is very important tool   to identify okay so people will see don't share 
your logins all those things like this is because   of this someone has logged in in your user and 
deleted that will become a very tedious problem   so this is main purpose so i hope uh i always 
tell to raheel we need a profiler because they ask   some application so all these commands whatever 
commands coming from the applications front-end   applications your client so since it's a client 
my application also will be a client my web it   can be a web page it can be windows forms 
anything will fire query whatever queries   it fires it will be captured here so we can see 
what does what i mean what queries it is firing   based on that we can easily point out which table 
it is referring to i i will be don't know what   tables it is referring so i can see from this 
profiler what tables it's referring so i can   see system configurations it's referring 
my username so i can go and check in that   table so it is as simple as that when 
you have a profiler in place we can   easily find what tables so it is used 
for troubleshooting basically and also   it's used for to know the whoever logged 
in which database the query is firing   what queries are firing frequently those things 
will be tracked this is one of the main important any questions in this sql profiler okay one last thing i want to show it to you 
so i have uh something like this i want to   take a backup or once i have taken a backup i 
want to restore the database what i need to do   go here restore database already taken a backup 
of it so from device if it's stored and add something over here software venture works so these database files will be stored in stored when you take a backup 
of a database it will show it as   bi key so it will be showed once you 
choose that one press ok then press ok database restored successfully so earlier we 
have dw now you have another database here   which is nothing but works 2014. 
the tables are entirely different   here you see with the schema human resource 
person person entity all those things okay   and taking a backup of database is so simple right 
click um task backup that's all okay just choose   the path let it be in uh same path just press ok 
that's all okay once you want to restore right   click and create so this database does not exist 
earlier so usually you can go and check i want   that bak files to work on so just download it 
then import it it is as simple as that you no   need to create tables all those things the tables 
everything it is not only the schemas or i mean   uh only the structure it will also have a data 
once you take a backup it will also have the data all the datas are there okay okay guys i'm on time i've completed anything in this session 
any clarifications required okay guys that's good let's stop it today 
this conference will now be recorded so let's let's have a quick overview what we have discussed 
yesterday so yesterday we saw about uh schemas   and uh schemas is nothing but a group of grouping 
of tables that is used for your giving security   rights so only those peoples having pertaining 
to certain departments they can access   and there is a main purpose and we have created 
some users and role-based security how to do that   and the purpose of security so yesterday we 
saw about giving one particular user giving   only the three tables having a select access when 
we try to delete it it doesn't allow him since he   the user has only select access so these kind of 
things we can't do it in file management system   that is where we there is a main advantage 
of going for a database management system   that point we have highlighted and 
we just imported one of the file   export is same operation whatever you 
see here hello who joined deepak okay   so hello so just we are discussing about what we 
have saw yesterday so we just saw about uh import   of our table and how we need to do an export you 
see some data over here you joined some queries   and you got some table information here so 
this query can be a simple query as like this select star from table or whatever queries you 
have did yesterday or previous days using multiple   joints this is your output assume like that then 
you can save these results as there's not adjuster   and export see this will also give you the results 
that's saved in a csv file comma separated file   so just returning this result and click on this 
corner left top corner then you can right click   it you can save the results so this is kind 
of export but this is not the actual expo   this will give you only the one file if you 
want to export multiple files how to do that   so click on the database task so these many 
tasks you can do backup restore measuring   all other steps so export data similarly we saw 
yesterday about import data so let us have export choose a data source again data 
sources server sql server only so same server this is the database and choose what you want where to 
export i will export it to a flat file   i need to choose file over here 
let me choose payroll.txt whatever   next copy data from one or more tables 
or views okay so i can copy multiple   data table into one file or i can create 
uh one file per table something like that   those things you can specify here so 
this is my source table account table then run immediately so same thing will happen the 
purchase or those file will return some records   okay so this is the kind of exporting your   table then we discussed about link server as we do 
not have another server in place we can't able to   practically see how it works so it's as i 
said earlier we need to refer the link server   and database name followed by a schema name 
and a table name so we not access the table   and the profiler is a tool used to track 
your changes or whatever changes you do   all the events will be captured 
there it's used for it okay okay views what it is used for any idea anyone aware of it hello obviously yes so can 
you tell these people so that they can understand   i have to collect the data 
from multiple tables okay yeah   okay great so what what is the 
purpose of it when you create multiple   tables when you want the data from multiple 
tables you will always acquire it i mean um   yesterday query i'm trying to take 
let's take this joints example okay so this is the table we have taken yesterday so this contains a joint okay so when you want to   have a join multiple tables okay we need to use 
left join energy and whatever can be so um right   here i will ask one question so if we have a 
one table do we not no need to create a view i come again i mean you said like uh if we 
want to join multiple tables then you need   to create a view so what about if i have only one 
table even with that i can create a view or not   yeah you can create a view with one table 
also yeah so basically it doesn't matter   you how many tables you want to have 
basically you want to store this query   in the database object that is the main purpose so 
if you definition says like it's a virtual table   now you can see like this is the result when 
you execute this query whatever you see here   so this result is not stored whereas this query 
can be stored somewhere in database so that is   the purpose of creating a blue create view view 
name view name is like customer product purchase okay so you always end up with having this 
kind of queries frequently okay you need   to join multiple tables and if you forgot this 
query somewhere then it becomes very complex so   what you need to do is whatever 
query result you want to have   you write that query and put it 
in a view so this will create   a virtual table let me show it to you guys so when 
you select this query you are getting these four   columns and with 10 rows so when you create 
a view with this query what it will do is   instead of selecting this particular 
statement i can select this particular view select star from this one okay so you see the difference even 
you can select this query if i remove this one   so this particular view is stored now you see here you have the same result even if you 
select the view or the query okay   so basically your cookie will be stored in 
the view okay and the results won't be stored   so view won't store the data it will store 
only the query that is the main purpose of view   let me show it to you so here it is the query 
i mean the view is stored here customer product   purchase so as rahil pointed out in order to have 
multiple joints okay so people will forget or they   use different joints sometimes once you use left 
joiner in engine so this query will be stored and   if you use only one table okay and you use some 
work conditions where gender equal to male are   kind of i want to have some constraints 
to be defined someone has some question commonly used queries uh where we every time 
we will run again on a daily basis sometime so   those queries if we can save it it will be easy to 
retrieve right yeah so there are multiple purpose   so it is not you cannot store those 
queries whatever you regularly use uh   for that even this is used for a 
security purpose as well the views um the thing is like instead of 
giving access to the table   you cannot i mean you can give access to the 
views okay so as we discussed yesterday giving uh   object level security only the what objects you 
need to get only three tables are given for hr   manager role or someone has a different username 
so you can give access to the views so he cannot   able to do any operations in the view only the 
deletion or insertion can happen in the table   2 is just a query so that is main purpose of it 
it is not only the common that is also one of the   purpose but you say like you use a 100 to i mean 
10 to 15 coins usually you cannot store it as a   view just that that query will be having 
written some useful information always   like this so i want customer product 
information then you store it okay and that is main purpose then 
you have something like security   security purpose instead of providing a 
table access you give access to the view that is a two important purpose of creating a view so in the 
view what you can do whether you can do a delete   or insert as i said earlier it will create 
only the virtual table you can have only the work and it i mean select statement 
inside so what about order by class create view customer purchase this is customer purchase 
i have a customer purchase select star from even you can create like this so this is used for   encapsulation some kind of concept like you have 
a customer table customer purpose and you don't   want to expose this table name instead you want 
to give access to customer purchase so you are   this is used to hide the base table information 
there are multiple purpose for creating a view   so when i create a view like this only with this 
table information select star from based on order i think it should not allow order by pro id i don't think it will create see 
this is another important thing   you cannot specify order by class inside 
the views inline function derived table sub   queries all those things common table 
expressions all other stuffs because it will store only the result whatever order 
it is fetching you cannot specify it here   but once you create the view okay 
then you can specify the order select   i'll comment it out so that you 
can understand select star from i'm selecting from the view okay then order by pro id this is simple i mean it is as 
usual you can specify the other part okay   because it it is storing only the structure okay 
or it will not store what order you need to store   so that is where it is restricting these are 
certain limits limitations and using a view   but it doesn't make any difference 
for you guys okay with this note   let us focus on another topic common 
table expression so i have said like   we have created a view here okay and what about 
i need some results to be stored temporarily for that we have a concept 
called common table expression okay let us have one example here so you have a customer john and biscuit everything okay 
i can i want to store i want to filter out   whoever borrowed biscuits okay   so what i will do i want to use some biscuit 
and chocolate these two conditions so these   two things i will try to get it in another 
table i want to put it in in condition here select star from i can do like this assume you you need to create some temporary table   and those results you need to 
filter it over here okay our product in with 10 product s so this is a way to create some 
temporary results okay select star from   see see here if i select this statement 
it will throw me error because whereas when you create a view after creation 
of the view this is object created in the   database i can able to go and select it okay 
without choosing that one creation is like   your object is created the metadata is created 
but it's a common table expression i have this   one here okay even i do like this okay 
it will throw error because it should   have the width statement should follow 
with the select statement you see here i need to select both with and select 
statement the width should followed by a   i mean the select statement 
okay so this is the thing like   i have created some template results i want 
to store it so this is nothing but your common   table expression which will hold some stem results 
this can have any table information okay for   simplicity i have created two rows and which is 
having only one column product okay so this result   what i am going to do this should be acting 
as a filters in this particular table i want biscuit and chocolates 
so select where product in   you guys know about uh temporary tables i mean 
uh sub queries select prod from this table so once i select this i need to comment it as i 
said this scope of this table this common table   expression is within the next select statement 
so i should not use this select statement   i need to use the select statement i got whoever purchased biscuits and chocolates   okay this this column i mean 
this you can mention it here also okay biscuits and chocolates something 
like that but assume you have   you don't know how many records it's going 
to fetch whatever query it's going to   fetch here you remember some queries like whoever 
has this degree and the employees whoever has this   designation those employees should be 
filtered something like that so in those cases   if we don't predict the account have a 
discrete values the result set will be   based on the conditions over here in those cases 
you can use such a common table expression okay so the view and common table 
expression is different   this will exist only with this query 
if i use the same table reference after the select statement if i run along after the 
select statement this will not   execute invalid object name temp 
prod okay so that is the scope scope   you understand i think scope statement scope 
of any statement how long it will exist   whether it's a global or it will last for the 
session all those things someone has a question this union is uh will combine both 
the select statement right data union   you include red select biscuit broad 
union so this union will combine both the   queries yes yes get the data yes yes it 
will uh uh append the rows among the rows   this is row one this row two maybe 
you prefer confusion i'll put it as id yesterday i think union and 
all i taken last session so so this is first and second forget about the union part just uh i mean uh you 
you still have confusion with union how it works   no no just uh the application just asked okay 
so now the focus should be on the common table   expression this is uh with okay the view 
definition you just try to um compare it   with a view and a common table expression view 
is permanently stored in the database whereas   common table expression the scope is within the 
next select statement even if you use here this   won't work but whereas if it is a view you can 
create it as a view if i change this one as a view now you have seen like this result you got 
result for this query you got error for   this select statement error over here okay what 
happens if i create it as a view create view okay even you can do like this view first you need to create you cannot take your along with this just execute 
with that two select statements now you got the   output okay this is the main purpose when to 
use when not to use okay now there is something   like uh common table expression similar to 
that you have something like temp tables temp tables okay there are two types i think for now i think 
you can stick to two uh hash table hashes table hash table is nothing but local tim table and 
hash table is nothing but a global temptable global temp so what is those so all these things guys uh 
the temp table purpose is to store your results   temporarily and one while the purpose of the 
table is met then you can drop the tables that   is the main purpose so till now we have seen like 
this can be stored in a view this can be stored in cte now i am going to store 
this result in temp table so say for example it is like create table the temper table is same as your normal table 
creation but you need to prefix with the hash id and you say product integer 
let's have a care of 20. okay i can i am going to create another table i'll say global temp product and prefix with hashes so this is the one now let us 
insert these two records i have a template cable insert into okay it is as simple as that let 
us insert for global table as well okay so what is the difference why when 
to use when you should not use global   when to use local those 
things i will explain shortly they both have data okay here now i will 
take this guy this local template table   and put it in a new session that is see whatever 
you create a new query here okay that will have   id if you can see at right end bottom when i 
highlight there is a number after my name 54.   then over here it is 53 this is nothing but 53 54 
under session ids okay so you have created this   local temporary variable in session 53 you cannot 
go and access this temporary table in another   session but you can access within the same session 
so the scope of local temporary variable is within   same session whereas hashes table i created here 
in session 53 i can go and access in a new session okay so this temporary table and 
global temporary table once you drop   wherever you are created once you close this 
guy okay this session then these template   tables will be drop automatically so i can 
drop it manually also drop table like this table so the all other operations altering a table 
whatever operations you performed in the table   those operations you can do it in this table 
the only purpose is to store your results   temporarily okay and sometimes so where you will 
use okay basically let me answer this question   so basically you have next next i'm going to talk 
about the stored procedure where you keep calling   one procedure from another procedure and sometimes 
what happens based on different applications you   you call some data called in one session should 
be accessed in another session okay and in the   in those cases and that results should be stored 
temporarily so in those cases you will use global   and some cases like within the procedure 
or within the execution of the batch okay   all these things when i go and execute as a 
whole query it is called batch running when i run   the batch starts from go when you have a go 
statement from this go statement whatever   statements you execute it is as a batch 
okay in procedures you use go statement so   within that course statement it's running as a 
batch that will create one session so your scope   should exist within that batch or 
session then you use local variable   and your data should reside for other sessions 
i mean should be available for other sessions   then you need to use global temporary variable 
mostly we will use this one because our logics   is not so that complex so this is good to know and 
what is the purpose of a common table expression   that is used to store small results basically 
there is a memory logic behind all these three   local global and this is your cte okay there are some memory requirements this temporary 
product on temporary tables is stored in your   system databases stem dbs i think it will have 
somewhere over here uh temporary tables see   global temp prod global temp prod so it will 
be stored in your as i mentioned earlier what   are the system database you have a master model 
msdb temp db so when you create a temp db here it   will create a temporary tables here so physically 
physical table is created okay whereas in cte you   don't create a physical table anywhere in the 
database that is the main difference so you might   ask why i need to use template tables instead 
i can show the results in cte within the scope   so usually if the volume is huge that requires 
some storage go for local temporary variable   otherwise if you run it on the cte it will be 
stored in ram so whichever doesn't stored in   a database physically these things will be stored 
in ram so better about it your system performance   will reduce say for example if you are storing 
more than one million record don't go for city   instead you should show for template tables such 
cases you need to take a call based on that okay   and if your template table should be accessed by 
different sessions go for global temporary tables alright guys any doubts in this no fine let me proceed to start procedure so we've seen about these tables views the purpose 
of use your all your predefined queries and used   for security purposes as well now let's go little 
on programming part like stored procedures and   functions all those things let's start with the 
stored procedure first so similarly you have your   queries written okay in the views you have only 
select statement what happens when i have some   data querying or data manipulation language i 
need to frequently update one particular record   customer information okay whenever i receive 
in the forms you have like as we discussed   earlier how the data will get into a 
database from business perspective you have   forms in front end they create a customer 
they press button insert or i mean submit   you will get insert into statement into the 
table similarly sometimes like when i want to do   a change in my customer information so what we 
need to do we need to do the update correct so   update each time you cannot run one um code i mean 
uh that stupid i mean that piece of code is by   default what you need to pass usually people will 
update a phone number people will update address   so what information you need to update phone 
number or address based on what you need to update   customer id so this is a predefined structure and 
i am going to repeat for n number of customers   if i write a code once based on passing a 
parameters then customer information will   be updated just passing a parameter so these kind 
of scenarios you create that code in a procedure   okay that is what one of the main purpose you 
go for a procedure repeated task you want to do   that code to be executed every time 
some operation happens then you go   for a procedure let's have the same example 
now i'm going to update customer information sql training corona customer master okay here what i'm going to do 
i give a customer id okay i i will pass   customer address and phone number okay when i 
change any of this information my information   should get updated so how to update usually you 
write update query right update customer master set customer address for simplicity i will go for 
customer address update for now   okay and we can focus on another parameter 
later customer address i will say like um i uh bangalore i moved to chennai where customer id equal to 
three so what it does it does   like for naga you update the customer 
address to chennai let us try that one why i am not in a correct database okay this is the thing now you 
see the same information now   from naga it's moved to chennai now you 
have got it right earlier it was bangalore   now you updated to chennai now now this 
is a repeated task people will keep   updating the location phone number all those 
things so this is the statement i want to   execute each time when there is an update 
okay so such a scenarios what i will do create procedure customer update okay and the procedure if you can have any 
without any parameters also okay if you keep   like this it doesn't get any information 
about the customer or what values to update   so you need to create a parameter here at customer id okay so remember the symbol 
that indicates a viewer variable okay   at customer id comma at address you need to define um the data type of 
obviously okay what is the data type of master keep same as whatever you mention okay so the procedure create procedure 
procedure name with parameters   then begin okay begin should be the thing then end okay guys so now i have given these two things now 
here then whatever values i'm getting it over here   should be updated here okay that is what replacing 
the hardcoded value with whatever you pass got it guys so yeah see if i have a hard coded value here 
okay let us see like the main purpose of   creating a procedure is like there are number 
of customers over here okay uh maybe i will take someone has huge data six to seven records okay here you have uh five 
records this is for better i'll take this table see you assume you have we 
have a customer data you have thousands of ten   thousands of customers okay so basically we want 
to update phone number customer address frequently   so how you will do it people enter 
in the screen in the gui front end   then you capture those value whatever you want 
to modify you will capture that value and for   you whom you want to apply for that particular 
customer so obviously in a customer table only   you want to apply so you need to get these two 
information what information you need to update   that is for now it's an address and for whom you 
want to update for whom is customer id so these   two things are very crucial things that you need 
to capture from the input system okay that will   update it okay based on that only you will 
update so earlier what i did here is for   customer id 3 when i want to update for now 
there is no three when i want to update for kumar   now he is in chennai when i want to he is 
changed to bangalore i need to write bangalore   so assume like you keep on storing this 
information what you want to update then you   are not going to update it manually you should not 
do it because you have 10 000 customers you cannot   have it one by one okay instead what we are doing 
we have written a procedure programmatic approach   where you get those information customer id and 
address and in this place you replace those values   instead of force see now first i will 
update for kumar i will update to bangalore so how i can do it programmatically i will pass 
4 and bangalore here okay in this customer id   in bangalore so this should update me that 
bangalore information now you see he already   changed to bangalore now i say he moved to delhi 
kumar moved to delhi so i i should not make it   dynamically sure should you have to make 
it dynamically for any customer i change i   should not hard code it so just replace these 
two values the hard coded values wherever you   miss and whatever values you are getting as input 
you put it here now i create this procedure okay now you see the value here now one two three one 
two four five seven now i want to update deepak   from chennai to delhi i can use this procedure execute you give a values like 
you need to give the value 5 comma deepak i want to change him to delhi now i am not running the update 
scriptment i am running this procedure now done so you see deepak was in 
chennai now he got updated to   delhi now you want to do it for abdullah he 
is in quite i will move him to abdullah s2 i will move him to somewhere 
else i will say afrika you see guys abdullah isn't quite i'm 
just passing it here but how it get   this is not referring any table i'm just 
calling this procedure to africa the logic   whatever i've written here that updates 
the abdullah to africa you got it guys so this is this is how you need to create this 
is the main purpose you go for a procedure   any kind of operations that will perform your 
data manipulation language updates deletes inserts   regular inserts so into a table those 
things you store it in a procedure so all   applications your windows forms web 
forms will access to this procedure   they will pass their parameters like customer 
id or customer name whatever the key attribute   that will pass in this parameters so they will 
capture it here then it will be passed here this   is the thing guys so you can do any operations 
here even i can use the same statement here   for logging also so it is not only one statement 
insert into customer master whoever i am passing here i can do a log so multiple statements you can do insert into select what are the columns only a name 
is not the one is that no so i have only   this information here one i mean customer id comma address so how i so now i have created the procedure 
earlier now i'm changing some logic inside   this this is the logic change earlier i have only 
update so now i'm changing a little logic so it's   the command is as usual you are changing 
the structure just create i mean change   the create to alt alter procedure procedure 
name same thing just use this one now you see   i have our two tables now select star 
from customer control customer master okay now i got these two tables now i'll say 
for john 67 i'm changing him to london too 67 first i pass 67 to london to i'll say uae now 
what happens earlier whatever we did changes there   is no entry here now i have made a logic 
to insert entry into custom mass transfer   customer master only two columns will be inserted 
id and address there won't be any names okay just   for your understanding it's not a proper way 
but still so for 67 uae will be inserted first   then for john uae will be available here that 
is the expected output let us execute this   you see one draw affected one row effector 
inside what rows affected it will be   duplicated in your result 
set now is select the data so now you see here another entry in customer 
master table 67 uae and for john we have changed   to the address is changed okay so this is 
the thing guys uh about uh procedure it's   very simple as that and something like we can 
have a set no count set row count on something row count on off selector there is some function that will 
say like no count or something   this is the this is useful like no count off 
no count on so this is useful when you have so there is a cast involved 
when you run this query i mean earlier you see like row cones on 
i mean one was affected one was affected   message was displaying so this itself will take 
some time so this is people say like this is one   of the performance improvement factor so in 
order to avoid the such messages you say like   test it no count on off something like that 
okay just for your understanding i'll mention okay yes so when i executed again so honorary was 
there so there is no changes in your data here so this is about your procedures 
any doubts in this procedures views hello hello let me explain this 
again this uh effect on yeah so when i have this one removed you see like 
halter procedure like this when i update uae   you get rows affected rose affected based on the 
insert statement here this message is displayed   based on the update statement here the second 
message is displayed sometimes what happens to   avoid there will be number of statements you 
you keep on executing so that will have a lot   of messages like this so to avoid these messages 
to be displayed you need to enable this option okay so i'm altering again now you try to run this woman 
i will make him to woman sorry sorry now you now you see like i said uh oman   there is no messages now one rose 
affected one was affected you got it yeah that is the main purpose okay so this is the thing and uh similarly you 
have one last thing about today's session   we have a procedure we have something like 
functions this conference will now be recorded so i added some more points here it was only a 
views and uh views were there i will add triggers   and curses okay fine so i i'm jumping between 
the topics i'm not going in this flow   i mean australia we saw about views then 
the order over here i need to revamp   so forget about that so we start working on stored 
procedures and functions so yesterday we saw about   short procedures i will cover some more in that 
and today we will start with the functions okay and moreover what are the difference 
between functions and stored predictions   that we will see once i create some 
function example then we'll go for it okay so functions it is uh again a same kind of 
thing yesterday we created a stored procedure and   stored procedure what it will do it will do the 
update let me check whether i showed that script triggers functions right operations no 
i think i don't have uh that one today   was 31st of us and some other mode i didn't see 
okay so yesterday we saw about uh stored procedure   that used to update that will get two parameters 
no need to worry we already have this one here   customer update so one as i said these are 
the objects so your table is your object   your view is your object you see here these 
are the physical structure it will create it   so tables and we have created views those things 
are created as an object here then you have a   store twitter this is also an object so these 
are the things it has created now you can see the   script over here so what it does it gives two 
parameters one is customer id and address then   it does its job just it will insert into a table 
and update the address both the things it will do   so like this operations if you want to 
perform you use procedures whereas functions create function okay let me take some table here customer master or customer purchase just want to see what it's taking 
okay price into quantity perfect i'll take the quantity at price integer again and this is nothing but purchase value there is a function name called purchase value   and which takes two input and the syntax 
is it should return a value return at net price something like that   okay this is the syntax of it i just 
found something over here give me a minute functions table valued function scalar valued function see basically a function should return a 
value over here if you see a create function   that will take parameters that should 
return a value okay returns date time   maybe we will say written integer okay as begin declare okay fine it should say returns i'll take the syntax from 
references returns integer okay there is a problem   here you don't see anything so what it does is see 
similar to a programming language you can declare   a variable i hope everyone familiar with c or what 
basic languages you can declare a variable price   okay and declare it as integer then 
what you can do is set you need to   if you want to assign value to this variable 
you can say like set okay set price equal to   quantity into or i will say 
net price quantity into price this is as simple as that okay then what it will 
actually do once it calculates just return me the   value return net price this is simple 
programming okay that you understand this one it gets two input variable ones quantity and 
price it will multiply and return the results   if you give two and three here it will return six 
so this is what you written a program or i hope   everyone has written some programs if not this 
is the way you have to write so you need to store   these results in some place that is the variable 
i have created here this is the way to create   your variable declare is a statement to create a 
variable that will hold temporary results so i'm   setting the value i mean the calculation of this 
will be stored in net price and i'm returning this   value over here okay this is the definition 
of your function then i just execute it okay then how to call them so i can use select off purchase value and i need to specify 2 comma something like that 
so i hope everyone knows the multiplication just   i will execute 2 into 9 is 18 i'm getting this 
value okay so what is the main difference over   here is like so you guys understand right these 
kind of calculations you will create okay and you   can use this function to compute some values 
it is as simple as that you just imagine you   are finding the uh tan theta i mean some average 
values or you are passing some calculations like   average for that month any calculations you can do 
over here okay you pass that value to input values   then you can execute you can pass those two 
values here then you get the results over here   okay this is your function   net price i think even you can execute you cannot 
execute function like this let me check that one so you cannot execute a function okay you 
can select a function like this only okay   so that is the main difference between your store 
procedure and functions what i'm trying to say is   you have here a create procedure over here 
okay create procedure procedure name and   in order to do a call to this procedure you use 
execute procedure name you pass some id 3 comma   some bank load or chennai whatever like 
this you will pass you are you are executing without parameter i think okay now you got the value similarly here i 
think you can do it let me check that one execute will not work here okay this is executing but you 
are not getting the results   now to get the result you need 
to put it like this select you you no need to use the select if you select   then this is enough you can get 
that value in the select statement i'll use both the kinds together so in order to get the values you need to use 
select statement to run the query now this is   the value i'm passing it over here 2 comma 9. 
what happens if i run this function for a table   you can do that by passing this function so here 
i found one data this table i want to multiply   this quantity into price i want the result 40 
to be displayed in a new column this i want to   do programmatically i don't want to write the code 
even i can write like this the same thing quantity   into price okay this i can do it here itself 
i'll get the results i got this result 40 60   something like that instead of that in this place 
i can call that function passing quantity comma   price that will calculate this 40 60 70. let us 
show let me show that one what i'm trying to say so this is a table and i'm having 
without function thought function then i'm using this function i'm calling 
this function okay here you see in the   select statement i'm calling this function 
this is the function name purchase value   instead of 2 comma 9 i need 
to pass this quantity here this price over here so 2 comma 9 gave me 18   so this one and this one should 
return me the same using function so this is without function this is using a 
function both written me as same 5 into 10 is 50   5 into 10 15. so using a function this returns 
this is without a function in the direct column so   i have written it like this because some 
calculations you cannot do it in a simple   calculation like this okay some calculations 
you will pass these two values and in your logic   you compute lot of things over here you write 
hundreds of codes over here then final results   should be passed into this column based on the two 
input values so such a things you go for function   and the main difference now you got about what is 
a function used for and the stored procedure also   you can do it the same way but you cannot use 
it in the select statement the stored procedure   you cannot use it in the select statement 
say for example what i'm trying to say is   so since i said like um i can pass uh parameters 
here so this customer id and address also i can   pass right you might have asked so this 
is the stored procedure customer update   since the store project requires 
execute statement explicitly mentioned   okay you cannot have a select statement 
on the execute statement over here so you   cannot use a stored procedure in your select 
statement okay that is the thing but whereas   you can have your function in your search 
statement that will execute for each row i hope i am clear with this let me show you uh base difference between these two stored pressures and functions the difference 
is this the basic difference and the function   must return a value but store pressure it is an 
optional so this is the core difference between   your function under stored procedure you remember 
our stored procedure that was inserted and updated   that did not return any value written in the sense 
you give some input that will return that value   and you show it whereas that function you gave 
these two inputs it returned you a value called 18   when you execute this procedure 
that does not return any value this does not return any value just it has 
it has done his operation whatever you do   okay if you want some operations to written 
some value by default you go for function okay   then store pusher can also return a value it is 
not mandatory like it should not return it's uh   they said like it's an optional okay 
but short pressure it is an optional   but when you want something to be 
returned then you go for a function okay so that is what they mentioned even as 
procedure stored procedure can return zero or   n values that is any that can return 
values there is a core difference okay   next point has function can have only input 
parameters for its whereas approaches can   have input or output parameters so it 
is same i mean more or less so function   should have input parameters can have only 
input parameters only input parameters means   whatever you pass and procedures instead 
of written value they say it has output   parameters okay the parameters matters 
whatever you pass here you can specify i will tell you later functions can be called from   a procedure whereas a process cannot 
be called from a function so it's like some people will have a comment from here to the 
there to that it is not possible vice versa is not   possible meaning like inside a procedure okay 
inside a procedure you can call the function   but from a function you cannot call a procedure 
that is what it mentioned let us have that one   these two points clarified and just altering 
this procedure create function function name   and saying alter so as you show you 
guys this the ddl operation applicables   although means you are modifying something 
what they are saying is i have this function   if i say like i want to call something inside 
this function i'm calling this procedure okay you execute it okay now it see   it has compiled compiled means this 
code is saved but when you run this one only functions and some extended shortcuts 
can be executed from within a function so it   says like only functions can be executed another 
function you can call you cannot call a stored   procedure inside your function okay in such a 
cases you should avoid it basically guys people   will confuse which one i want to use i want to use 
function or short procedure when you want to call   us another stored procedure inside your code then 
you go for stored printer so store procedure can   call another stored procedure fine but you want to 
do some simple calculations such a kind of things   or any other complex calculation that returns a 
value single value or multi-value whatever then   you go for functions this is the simplest way to 
understand about functions and stored predictions   and the other things are there projects 
allows the stored pressure see people   always say procedures in sql world they will 
not say with the short procedure it's procedure   procedure allows dml insert update delete whereas 
function allows only select statement okay these   are the things you need to consider what to choose 
whether you go for short procedure or function if   you want to do insert delete update inside that 
so always you need to go for stored procedure this is the point i highlighted procedures 
cannot be utilized in a select statement   we cannot call a procedure in a 
select statement as we did before   the price into quantity whereas functions can be 
embedded in a select statement so they use some   technical words don't confuse in the select 
statement you can call a function then short   process cannot be used in sql statements it's 
simple either in a scale or select both are same   and functions can be used since it's used in 
select you can use it in where condition whatever   place okay these are the things you just keep it 
for your reference anyway i'm going to share this   presentation only syllabus i have shared and keep 
updating this um slide so once it is done tomorrow   or day after tomorrow i will share this 
both the things along with the recordings now i'm going to have another session i mean another topic triggers and curses so before heading to explaining about 
triggers technically let me tell you   when you want to use triggers when you 
want to use cursors okay so triggers   as the name indicates it will trigger something 
some other operation if something is happened   and it should initiate some other operation so 
this is what a trigger is this is when you use   trigger so for example when i want to create 
a product okay and i want to intimate this to   my manager or any new request comes 
i want to intimate to someone else so   assume there is new product entered then 
that will insert into a product information   then what it will have to inform this like 
it has to send some email to a manager   or it has to insert in the log table or it has 
to intimate some other operations trigger some   other operations so these kind of things how will 
you do you cannot keep on monitoring these things   like once the product got inserted what has to be 
done something has to happen automatically once   some operations happen so these cases you create 
a trigger and say that what has happened what   should happen whether some insert should happen 
or some select is happening or delete is happening   in a table or object someone is logged in so 
those kind of things something has happened   what should happen that you need to mention 
in the code so this is what trigger is okay   let us discuss later about the 
cursors with this note let us focus on   trigger example technically so what i'm going 
to do let me explain that first i'm going to   create an employee and employer added as i said 
so in this example whenever a insert happen in   this employee table or not only insert insert or 
delete or update happens in this employee table   that should insert automatically in this table 
so this is a simple example i'm going to explain so let us have this table employees employ edit then i'm i'm inserting into employees okay now this is the definition of 
the trigger let us go one by one   line by line so the definition of trigger 
is says like that similarly how you create   the procedure views it is syntax is somewhat 
similar in procedure you say create procedure   procedure name create view view name that is 
create what object you are going to create   then object name similarly here create trigger 
trigger name that trigger on which table as i said   i want to insert into a whatever operations happen 
in employee it should trigger some other operation   so i'm creating a trigger on this table and for 
what for these operations insert update and delete   so if this three operation happens i want to 
initiate a trigger and that trigger what it   has to do it has to do this logic what it is 
doing this is inserting into employee audit just as simple as that okay let me create this definition of this trigger 
before that i want to explain another table um okay guys so now this is the definition of your trigger so so we have seen the top part two lines   if something happens this operation happens 
in this table then do this operation let me   quickly explain what is happening so it is just 
getting the login names all those things then see there is some concept like deleted 
inserted of this table basically when you   do an insert in this table employees dbo dot 
employees okay and what has happening here is it is not getting from the employees information 
let us spark these two this deleted command this   one insertion okay it is not picking up from 
the employees table and inserting into audit   instead there is something like inserted okay 
what is this called so in sql basically during   the transaction happening once you do a insert 
into any table or any other operation there is   a temporary table it is created okay a virtual or 
it is a physical table during the time only this   will have that value once you have inserted 
so this will have uh the value at that time   so using that value when it is inserted you 
are inserting into this employee's audit table   okay this is the one insert into 
employee table were inserted   okay similarly if there is any delete or update 
happens that will be stored in your deleted table   so from that you are inserting into 
audit table if you have a delete   then you are getting that value deleted okay 
and inserting into audit value so basically   we are getting we are not getting the data from 
the base table this is from employees because   you can ask once you delete the record that is 
gone how you will get that data and you will   store it in a temporary table or audit table you 
are running one query delete into this table once   you're deleted that's all that is gone then you 
need to store it into your audit table so before   deletion you need to copy and delete this is the 
one way instead you can use this kind of temporary   tables okay that is internally stored use that 
one too for audit purpose let us have a look   with an example okay so i have created the trigger 
that explains it will insert into a audit table   irrespective of whatever operations you do so now 
let us see what is there here i have four records four records and one record here what i 
am doing first of all i'm doing a update   so it's roll backing transaction 
okay let me explain that one also okay guys now you see here what has happened you will see the query first so 
first select statement this statement is written   one mark smith then i am updating the mark smith 
see the data here before updation mark smith   what i am updating employee name employee name 
is mark smith i am updating the employee smith   to triple set this is the one okay 
then i am selecting this record   i mean updation won't give you any record 
this result okay this result has given you   i mean this select statement has given you this 
result then i'm selecting from the employee audit   table i didn't do anything in the employee 
audit table because earlier you see only one   four records i have created for mark smith i'll 
change it to triple set what has inserted here   audit id one employee id one mark 
smith mark smith was the old value   and added a update okay mark smith 
was updated this is the thing next i'm going to do see the magic guys here i didn't say about transaction let 
me explain that one along with this   see if i do along with all other stuffs like 
this this begin transaction will make you to have   the batch execution whatever statement 
followed by this begin transaction   which run in a full batch so after 
this transaction you say commit commit here then only all operations whatever it 
performed will be updated in the respective tables   now you see like i we executed this command i mean 
along with the begin transaction and transaction   so this employee doesn't got updated to triple set 
he still has mark smith what i'm trying to say is one we saw like he has got 
updated triple set okay why   it is not being updated here in this employees 
table because we have rolled back the transaction   so all these things are roll backed it will not 
happen in the actual table once i say commit okay whatever operations so when i run update 
here see when i do only the selection of this   query alone i mean update alone it will 
auto commit there is no begin transaction   in transaction commit a rollback transaction 
so this is another important factor here   so what i'm trying to convey is like now instead of roll backing i will update this 
guy for one i'm going to run begin transaction to   commit then this time when i execute this employee 
for one it will update two to two triple visit okay now again it is saying the same now you see triple z that is for uh instead of 
mark smith you have triple z now so   rollback transaction is like whatever 
you have a code between begin transaction   and this transaction all the statements 
will be rolled back that will be nullified   it will be uh ignored all those comments okay 
that is the main purpose of rollback transaction on again when you roll back you need to doing 
including the table name right employees audit   no no no see rollback means begin transaction 
so it says rollback means all this operation   irrespective of the tables or whatever operations 
you do everything will be stored until you say   rollback commit you say commit all the things 
will be committed it is not for the table   transaction means batch irrespective of 
the tables or procedures whatever you call   okay okay so when i begin see whenever say i'm i have doubt when 
you say rollback transaction   will just roll back only for 
whatever we have done today if you do update here that will not be rolled 
back if you say here if you put some update   here that will not be rolled back you need to 
execute as a batch like this if you execute   within this it will it will update 
or it will roll back okay okay yeah   this is what i said batch you run it as a batch 
so all that usually in uh stored procedure   they will write like this create procedure 
begin transaction and transaction begin should   be at the beginning end roll back our end 
should be if some failure happens they will   call it as a rollback transaction if something 
everything goes smooth then they will commit it   so these three statements is very important if 
everything is good then commit it if something   goes wrong roll back it okay forget about that 
uh let me update again maybe took it directly mark smith okay okay now so you got it right 
guys so now you see again the audit table now   i did many times okay these are two times 
i did and it logs me modified who user   because who has done that that is why it is 
getting in the first of your trigger first   line are few lines of the trigger now here 
what i am doing i am trying to insert see   again union all all these things people are using 
again here i'm doing the rollback let me check so here what i'm doing i inserted these two 
records is that is that marcus rabbis and   here it is trying to insert in the audit also 
i'm getting the operation what operation i did   i'm not doing anything here but it automatically does some job   here you have only two records since it 
is rolled back those two records are gone   okay guys so this is about the triggers i hope 
you got it you no need to do something certain   things that should trigger some other operation 
what it has to do that has defined in your trigger logic so   i need to initiate trigger on this table for these 
operations insert delete update or select also   okay and what it has to do it will do insert or 
delete into based on the logics so this i have   explained some temporary tables it will keep 
based on the insertion happened so using that   it is inserting into another table so this is 
your trigger guys here you can send as as usually   will send the emails uh that is why i know i 
have pointed out if something happens say for   example someone has deposited huge amount then you 
can write some logic there in that you can send   emails to your managers alerts all those things 
okay for those purposes we will use triggers okay with this note let's move on to courses so just now we discussed about triggers 
let's move on to causes cursors   when we use so there are certain 
cases like um all these operations select statement or functions or stored procedures 
these things you are running as a set operation   set operation means for a table okay for a entire 
row you are selecting entire column you are   selecting as a set operation but what happens i 
want some operations to be performed for each row   one by one like looping okay you basically it's 
kind of a looping operation okay those kind of   stuffs you go for courses so causes if you have 
a ten thousand um records in your table you want   to look through all the 10 000 records to 
do some operation let us give one example so say for example like today's corona case like 
these are the guys who has identified as having a   corona and i want to identify first each customer 
who whomever ea has met those kind of stuffs okay   that information you have it in some 
other table so you need to pass this guy   okay in some other table and you need to fetch 
those information whomever he met something like   that okay so each row each customer you need to 
pass this will be acting as a parameter and for   each row you are finding something else and 
this procedure should run for multiple values   row by row operations it's like a looping 
that looping can be anything it can be a   thousand rows or ten thousand rows such 
kind of operations if you want to perform   then you go for courses let's have a quick look 
at an example then you will understand much better so here what they're doing is like in this example   they're taking a backup okay we are going to 
take a backup of the system databases over here   automatically you have uh four databases 
backup okay i mean these things to be uh   taken automatically when i run this code 
single piece of code that will take my backup   automatically that is the main purpose let us see 
uh the code so here so these are the variables as   i said before these are the variables to store 
some temporary results okay and the code for   recursive starts from here so cursor declare 
cursor okay i mean uh here it follows the name   before it's like a variable only guys so declare 
cursor name here you see declare variable name   and data type so similarly declare cursor 
name and your cursor as a keyword for for see these are the things it will have as a 
list like if you have multiple values or in my in   our previous example i quoted all the customers 
you want to loop so that list you need to keep   it here your query should return whom to loot or 
what to loop thousand records a thousand customers   those customer list it should written here okay 
so that information is stored in your cursor then   what you are doing then you are opening a cursor 
for each row for fetch next from this cursor   and store in that variable so i hope you guys 
remember you worked in any programming language   you need to loop means for each loop you get a 
value as 0 to 1 10 times you one to ten you need   to print means you will specify initial value 
one and the end value is ten and each value   you loop means each value you will print one and 
you will assign the value to variable to calculate   something and you will assign then you will look 
through the increment the value then you look   through same logic here so first value you are 
getting i mean uh you assume uh these will you   stick to this example so four values are stored 
in this uh cursor it is fetching the first value   okay master and stored it here then that master it 
will keep looping through using a well statement   because at first stages if you declare a 
cursor and at that phase status meaning whether   the cursor has a value or not when 
you say fetch next from a cursor   it fetch one value when you say again here 
which next from cursor the cursor will point to   next value i will explain that little better in 
excel now stick to this example master is stored   here it will check this condition is true then 
what will happen this is the code whatever logics   here only you need to write your logic in the part 
whatever logic as i said for thousand customers   we need to take whoever he has met so those 
information you can write here okay so in this   case for master it will generate the path then 
this backup database query will be fired then that   will take a backup okay then what happens once 
it has taken a backup it will go and check model   second value fetch next from db cursor into 
name what it will do it will take model   it will the while condition is true then it will 
take model backup again this condition will say   for msdp it will check here this is also true this 
will take backup for msdb it keep on going once   tempdb is taken back up fetch next from db cursor 
into name this will return zero or null value okay   it start a null while uttered first state is equal 
to zero then it will exit this is not true first   status will become null empty once the four things 
are fetched similarly for thousand customers   corona case all the thousand corona cases has 
retrieved then it will go and check the while loop   okay then it will return false after thousand 
customers return and it will fail okay basically   it's a looping concept guys you need to use the 
cursor nothing but it will hold the list of values   for those list of values one by one you will need 
to process okay one after the other then you will   use for each value what operations you need to 
perform that operation you need to specify it   is as simple as that let us have uh execute 
this one i didn't tried i need to have um   the column ironing trial naga maybe 
training will we will take backup over here   because sometimes the space in 
the file name will throw error okay i want to take backup 
in decolon training naga   let us see whether it's there nothing 
was there let's try to execute i'm running it for the first time i hope it should work there you go oh my god just taken 
back up for all other things okay   i think inside each thing it has taken uh 
master database backup process file input server   okay okay okay fine guys see the code is not uh 
in it is saying it's not these four conditions   it is not in not in means whatever names it has 
selected don't uh take the these four database   you take all other database so 
that's why it taken all these things   our example is correct only so adventure works so 
there are seven databases we have okay this list   they have taken one two three 
four five six seven okay you got it guys now you you see the practical 
example of it because is how it works   so it will be really confusing for you guys 
when to use procedures functions and you have   a triggers cursors okay you all came through 
it i mean once you have experienced this one   different scenarios will come into place 
at that time you need to be in a position   to choose between either of them either we need 
to go for triggers or we need to go for cursors   which one fits in that scenario okay at that 
time you will you have to decide but you need   to know what are the different things what is the 
purpose of procedure function triggers and curses got it guys any doubts no okay if you guys uh having no doubt 
then i will explain the joints part   today's session i'm fine i mean i'm done with 
today's session let's focus sometime on joints   or you want to take it tomorrow as a 
beginning today is at the end of the class you   guys are very feel bored mother 
yeah i'm having a call okay i'm working on that yeah yeah good 
so guys uh what do you think guys uh   can we have our joints now uh tomorrow hello no suggestions tomorrow i think two options 
tomorrow then we can have tomorrow   because we will start fresh then it will be easy   for you guys to understand okay let me summarize 
uh today's session then so we started with uh functions and a little bit of short procedures 
what are the difference between uh these two when   to use okay these are the combinations you should 
not confuse with stored question triggers causes   short projects or functions either of them which 
one to choose okay then we worked on triggers   so triggers is used to trigger some of the 
operations based on certain operations that happen   in any of the object okay cursors when you want to 
look through or you want to go roberto operations   okay in that case you need to go for courses and 
i hope i covered everything creating executing   modifying so these things it is very simple it's 
one liner like we had a function procedure here so yesterday itself we saw this so create 
procedure instead if i say alter okay this is   i i say like i want to comment some code here 
so i have modified something whatever it can   be so it's modifying okay it's as simple as 
that i don't want this procedure means drop so drop procedure procedure name even uh you can delete it um 
this is the code drop procedure procedure name   so once i do that you see here you have customer 
update it will be gone you won't find it   i can recreate that will be useful 
because no need to store this content once you have a procedure or view defined 
no need to store physically as a script   you just need to have it in your database 
keep your database safe take backups regularly   i got my procedure back so these 
are the things guys any object   you go for create procedure alter procedure in 
this place you can have view or table whatever   then use that appropriate objects 
this is what okay so about that then this conference will now be recorded okay so guys so this is our syllabus 
we have seen from the beginning   and um the topics almost i have covered 
just we will quickly go through it   so that you guys will remember what other things 
we have shown so basics of database concepts   like we see about what is the purpose of database 
what are the disadvantages of your file systems or   other stuffs we have seen in this and introduction 
to sql server and here in this module we have seen   about rdbms relational database management system 
what is the purpose of it each table is a relation   and management studio how to login to your 
client how server client is architected   then in this module is about the purpose of sql 
the structured query language this is the language   used to communicate between you are   always and hello deepak i'm just going 
through the syllabus whatever we saw so that   we are in sync what are the topics we have 
covered it's just a refresher session so   we learned about yeah we learned about databases 
and i hope veron also joined warren didn't shine let me see not sure why he didn't join that's fine 
let's continue so we saw about sql the purpose of   sql sql is a co-structured query language that 
is used to query your dbms database and it will   return the results to your client applications 
and we have a ddl statements dml statements   ddl data definition language that is to create 
alter modify drop your tables dml you need to manipulation language like insert all other steps   and you have a dql data querying language it 
should be coming here we have covered that one   so these are these different statements we have 
seen then constraints to have data integrity   constraints you guys remember like we had a null 
constraint not null constraint unique constraint   primary key foreign key so these are the 
constraints check constraint to ensure   that the h should not be greater than 18 or any 
combination so those kind of constraint to define   your data integrity then we saw about aggregate 
functions sum average max you need to use group by   when you want to aggregate you need to use group 
by and we saw what joints joints in order to get   information available in another table you need 
to use joins i'm going to cover this right now   and use uses security and schemas so 
we have created a user and it is not   all the users who logs into the database we nee 
can access the table we need to create certain   tables i mean users and give respective rights to 
him so we see like one of the user we have created   who has access only to three 
tables he can able to select and we saw about user security and schema 
schemas grouping of objects you know   you can create a schema schema as 
nothing but your like a functional area   for human resource you create one schema all of 
the objects you create there you can map it there   it's like a folder then views we have covered 
views purpose is a virtual table the data won't   be stored there it's like you can combine multiple 
tables as a query and show it there the data won't   be stored there just a query will be stored 
another purpose of use is to give your security   like people should not access to the tables 
instead you give multiple tables in a query then   you can access i mean people can access the view 
instead instructor tables so both the purpose we   use views we didn't start about index so these are 
the two topics i'm going to cover today joins and   indexing yesterday we saw about stored procedures 
and functions along with the cursors triggers   or other stuffs so store procedures in order to do 
certain operations repeatedly like getting update   you want to create one user you want to update 
some information you pass parameters based on that   you will write write your logic inside your 
procedure that will do the respective task   functions any calculations so yesterday we 
saw deep difference between show closure   and functions i'm going to share those 
this ppt about the ppt's which i have   this contains the syllabus and another vpt 
contains some of the key concepts like this so these are the things we have covered so today's 
focus is mainly very good topic indexes so any   idea before starting index what is the purpose of 
index here it says how to create all those things   so what is index what is the purpose of it any idea no idea okay fine that's okay 
i hope everyone is familiar with the   books while we are reading if you guys remember 
this one index in your books in college   it's the same concept like at the end of your 
book you will have some index like working group   which is available in this particular page 
number this 4266 if you see 201 232 233 234   if you want to study about active scanning then 
you need to go to this particular page then you   can refer that one okay some topics alphabetically 
it guys arranged like adapt network 206 common use   i mean basic services something like that so it's 
like a searching criteria where your records are   stored so this is the concept behind the index the 
same logic applies in your database level as well   so here is the definition an index is associated 
with a table or view that speeds up retrieval of   rows from a table or view okay it is basically 
you can create index for a table and rows which   helps you to retrial very fastly okay that is 
the purpose of your index an index contains   keys built from one or more columns in the table 
or view it is same i mean you can create index   for more than one column okay that is what 
it mentioned how it is stored it showed in a   b3 structure so forget about this it will make you 
complex to understand basically index is used for   quality travel faster so how it will be fast say 
for example i am storing i want to store customer   one to ten thousand are now you see facebook users 
all the users you have millions of users okay so   as soon as you log in you are one in one 
million so it has to get your information fastly   from that one million records okay so 
how it gets it should be very quick okay   so it has to navigate as soon as sees your name 
or you see your password when you hit that button   it should navigate directly to that 
particular place where it is stored so the logic behind this is like this you 
assume you have 80 ids okay now out of   that 1 million this is like that i mean now in in 
our example here you have ids 80 users 1 to 80.   so 1 to 50 there will be a reference it is 
shown in page 1 so here it will go 1 to 50.   so here in this page 1 you see like 
1 to 10 okay in page four i mean   you see the difference over here i mean the one 
two nine is in page four and from ten onwards   it's in page five so it will goes like this say 
for example uh id number 56 okay so it will come   and search here that is 56 56 is in second page 
second page is here so 56 is uh from 55 so 55 is   here so it will navigate to this particular point 
easily then fetches the results and gives to you   so this is what index does okay so ids are stored 
at the bottom level so even you create and primary   key okay so that will create a clustered index 
where your datas are stored at this level at the   bottom level over here so it will create an index 
structure like this then your datas are stored in   this last leaf node let me show it to you so 
this is clear guys i think this is very simple   when you have your ids ids are nothing but 
customer id login id unique values so those   unique values will have a value like this 
then those informations are stored here okay so cluster index so you have something like ids 
stored so where from a to uh say for example a   to g a to g is stored here so a to g from there 
you have values over here so this node you have   from values from a to g are not from a to g a to 
before g what is that abcdef g h abcdef till a to   f your values are stored here from g to is that j 
i mean g to z the values are stored here from m to   r values are stored here from yes to is it it is 
stored here so you when someone ask my name naga   then it will go and check this particular mn 
so it will be stored here some something so   it will navigate this path instead 
of going searching all the things   okay so if the index is not there what will happen 
okay it will go and check in each and every record   uh it will if i my name is naga whatever 
data is showed from the order it is stored   you ask deepak i mean a lot of times how it 
is fetching how it is retrieving the data   so this is the answer when you create an 
index it will store in alphabetical order   whatever column you have created the data are 
stored here it will be fetched from the page   one this is page one page two page three page 
four it is switched from this order okay always   okay when you are not creating an index it 
will be insert a random order based on the   page availability if these are concept behind the 
databases i mean how it is internally stored okay   so when you are not creating index the datas are 
stored random order whatever there will be like   storage concept whether the space is available 
here then insert it whether swim space is   available inside it so if there is no index naga 
can be stored here or here or any other places   it based on the space availability that system 
will decide there is a huge algorithm behind that   okay so again focusing on index so when you 
create an index the datas are sorted based on the   the column you have created index and 
it will be stored in the least level   this is your cluster index okay let us stop 
this one before going to non-clustered index   let us focus on cluster index when you create an 
index and without an index how it performs okay so we have a data over here now when i select 
this table i have a index here whether index is   used now or not let us see that one so using 
execution plan as we said before we can see   so clustered index scan okay when you are 
not using when you are not using your index   column in your bar condition it will always use 
a scan scan is nothing but the entire table from   one two three four all the things it will scan 
and pick up the results scan is nothing but row   by row each row it will go and fetch the results 
but whereas when i say customer id okay equal to 4   you see the execution plan here guys 
index scan i will create a new page so when i filter using customer id equal to 4 
include execution plan what it does is clustered   index seek seek is nothing but you are this flow 
i've filtered 4 so here it is stored with name so   for means naga assume like naga so it will go in 
this path and just pick up the seeking seeking the   appropriate value so difference is here seek then 
scan so when you're not using your index in the   back condition as i said before indexing is useful 
only when you are retrieving the value it is not   used for any other purpose basically when you are 
quoting the 10 000 records or 1 million records   the response time should be faster okay so 
when you create an index you need to use   it in the bad condition then it will be effective 
okay this is your cluster index now let me see if   i put instead of 4 when i see instead of index 
column i'm not putting the index column in our   condition i'm i am putting non-index column 
kumar when i search with kumar what it shows even i am not familiar with this thing let us see 
definitely it will not do index seek let us see so include execution plan okay see now the first query is using a primary 
key column the primary column in the bar condition   the second query customer name customer name 
in the wire condition first query it is seeking   that is finding the path the second query 
it is scan so there is no use at all   okay i mean even you create an index it is not 
that you create an index and use other columns in   a bad condition that will work out whatever column 
you create in an index that particular column   you need to use explicitly okay then only 
it will work otherwise it is normal even uh   some other even if you select 
without this one it is same   first what it will do now it will fetch this 
results first from this it will pick up kumar what this query will do it will not fetch the 
results i mean the all the records first then   it will filter instead it will go and check where 
is this four exist it will pick up only the record   fourth record as a whole it will be resulting 
only one uh one one input output operation only   this is the thing guys so this is about 
your cluster index why because your data is   stored in the same order as i said the cluster 
index when you have in a single table i mean as   a table single table can have only one cluster 
index because your data all the columns okay   it is not only ids your name address everything 
will be stored along with your clustered index   in this last leaf node this is your cluster index   and i said like there are multiple 
non-cluster index you can create what is that so here you have like non-cluster index it is 
same example so say for example naga after mn   it should be showed here maybe we say ota only 
so ota so ota means after m it comes after m so   it will go here and before yes so it will go here 
so ota and what happens this is the leaf node here   the data for ota will not be stored as we see 
in this example the entire row for other that is   address phone number everything is 
stored here so easily we can pick up   instead what happens for him it will have 
one reference for this row id where the other   informations are stored for rota it is 470702 
so here 470702 only the reference is stored   so based on the cluster index it can say 
a table can have only a cluster index   a table can have only the non-cluster index if 
it is a non-clustered index datas are stored in   random order okay i mean assume there is no index 
at all in a table you are creating a non-clustered   index then while you are inserting data stored 
in a random order only here in this data pages   then the non-clustered column it will have that 
reference where that reference is so at least   when you query with this it will go and fetch the 
water and the reference number it will pick it up   and show it to you so somewhat better than your 
previous because it is stored for a column for   ota it is only 470702 okay you can have another 
non cluster index so that particular reference   also will point to this row say for example 
you are creating up for a phone number so   this column in this water you will have a phone 
number phone number will have 470702 that will   have a same reference so this is what your 
non-cluster index okay let's see how it behaves let's create one non-clustered 
index for a phone number here create index cluster index on let us google it forget 
about that the syntax always sql server come on there should be some simple tips yes there you go there is very big things over here okay create without space   see these syntaxes are very pathetic index uh 
i'll put some index name okay test phone number phone number on the table name for 
the column okay the phone number that's all i think now what order it should be we are in some other database that's right here okay now you see here see you cannot see all these 
things how it is stored or all of the purpose okay now i'm searching using a 
non-clustered index column let us have it is doing a clustered index 
scan something new i mean if you run this guy this one returned you the cluster index seek 
clustered index scan okay clustered index scan   whereas here clustered index scan 
again so if you use that one i mean   non-clustered index column it will give 
you the cluster index scan only okay so that is the thing guys so the main 
purpose you got it right the main purpose   behind this clustered index and non-clustered 
index is that cluster index can be a only one   per table that is using your primary key 
uh if you want it to be a single i mean a   unique identifier for that column go for cluster 
key then a non-clustered column is like your any   frequently used work condition like address the 
location whichever you want the multiple columns   location can be in the customer then another 
thing is like what is his salary you can have   a numeric value also usually people will call you 
what is the salary of it what is the salary range   something like that and phone 
number obviously even multiple uh you have some addresses so these kind of 
things whichever you use in where condition   so you can have multiple non-clustered 
index so this is the code difference between   your clustered and non-clustered 
index this is about your indexing okay guys now let us see without i will drop this index how 
to drop this one and query this one how it works indexes test phone number non-clustered 
non-unique i can't drop it drop see here everything we can get drop index index on i think if you have your cluster index 
on then using even if you drop it   it results the same so what i'm saying is if 
you have your non-cluster index in place that   alone will give you some differences if this table 
contains both your cluster index and non-cluster   index just now we drop but we're created okay 
but core logic behind this is this one only   i mean it will have your data stored in separate 
pages only the references will be referred here okay guys with this note i am done i hope you have 
got something out of the sessions the sql class any doubts guys hello okay guys fine i hope we have utilized somewhat 
better in learning sql thanks for participation when there is an application has been 
created okay and those application data   has been stored in the database so these 
uh index okay at which point time they will   create this index after all the completion 
of application completely yeah so basically   uh when you when you as soon as you log in or 
whatever the transaction is going to have okay so   indexing basically we have some idea initially we 
thought we will be in a position like we will use   phone number other number based on our 
assumption we will create the index   but going forward okay after some time people will 
lost some other things also so you can add some   more indexes on that so initially we will based on 
our assumption we will create while creating the   database structure itself okay after your ass 
you asked after application evolves after few   months six months or one year people will change 
the application and change the columns also   at that time if they use those 
columns we can amend the indexing   and based on the user queries we can do that so 
it is not the fixed one once you have there is no   general rule right you need to create before you 
need to create after something like that usually   we will create and based on our assumption this 
will be the things but as you ask the application   whoever queries in some application they will 
query phone number in some application they   query the location based on the application it 
varies so based on that we will decide and keep   on creating the index the non-cluster index 
but the cluster index we need to create one okay okay okay fine guys i think uh i'm done   almost everything covered we did it in 10 days 
only because you guys are not so responding in case you didn't ask much 
questions usually it will be like   2 on 4th when i keep continuing the 
session people will stop me and you   will ask questions so that will take some time 
but now it is not in this batch so that's fine okay you can reach out to me anytime and 
i would suggest uh maybe if i can create   a form just give me a feedback otherwise 
just give me your feedback in uh what's up   okay and try to practice otherwise you can't learn 
definitely will forget in within few days okay okay guys thank you thank

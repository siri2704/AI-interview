hello all I'm Nishant in my YouTube channel I'll be teaching computer science courses along with aptitude resume preparation tips based on the demand further machine learning topics will be given additional importance so to start with I'll be teaching uh dbms course from the basics dbms stands for database Management Systems so before knowing uh much more about database Management Systems let us first know what is data data on a layman term we can just think of it as some fact or some information but these words cannot be used interchangeably in dbms particularly each word has its own significance so data is nothing but a raw and unorganized fact which is usually not useful to derive meaningful insights when I give you some random data you cannot uh you know derive some significance or you cannot draw a line between them to understand its meaning that is called as data for example I have given on red and 24 as sample data so what can you infer from this very well you can infer that arand is a name and red is a color and 24 is a number but is there anything any significance or can you draw some line connecting these examples I hope no red maybe uh the color of the cap that arand is wearing red maybe the color of the shirt AR might be varing and 24 I don't have any idea about 24 so moving on to information so what is information information refers to the organized and structured data which is usually the processed data that is used to take well defined decisions so information means process data so the data is cleaned organized and given in a structural format to help the users understand the meaning of the data so this process data is usually called as the information can you see the example Anand is 22y old man wearing red shirt so here you can derive some meaning from the information that is given here than the previous one so you could visualize Anand as a boy who is a 20 22y old man and who is wearing a red shirt as well moving on to database management system database is a collection of interrelated data uh the data can be organized in the form of a table and it can be retrieved inserted and deleted as we know any industry or any field that we consider they definitely require data to operate and to uh run their system uh let it be a college or university and Hospital a factory an airline system anywhere we any field that we consider they definitely require data and they also have a dedicated database management system to maintain the data so database management system is not only about maintaining data it is also about easier retrieval easier access and much easier deleting process so one popular example of a database could be a hospital database so it usually contains the patient details uh such as the patient age patients address their phone number and even uh the previous uh history of you know the admission to the hospital Etc we could also consider a college or university database that contains the name of the student their phone number their age the gender the courses that they have took the current year uh they are studying so dbms database management system is a system so which is popularly a software or a program this software is used to retrieve insert and delete data from the database so we use uh many tools we use many tools such as post ress SQL light MySQL and a lot more so a small difference between a database and dbms is that database is just the collection of data so database is collection of tables but dbms is a software that can be used to retrieve insert and delete data from those tables so dbms acts as a tool for the users to access the uh database table whereas a database is a static collection of tables that just stores the data so this is an example of a database table so here I have presented you with a university table this is just for illustration it's a sample table so this table has five columns and seven rows we have the following columns RO number name subject Mark grade and corresponding entries are given in the row so each student has a particular subject corresponding Mark and the grade that he has obtained in the particular subject

hello and welcome to this session on sql server tutorial today we are going to talk about sql server what benefit it provides and some queries and some sql syntaxes which will help you understand how to use sql queries now let's see what's in it for us today we will discuss what is sql server the usage of sql server different sql server editions and the differences between them and then what are the advantages of sql server instances and after that i'll show you execution of some queries some insert statements on the sql server instance which i have installed now what is sql server in any application development today in any computer application which we develop database sql server plays a very important and pivotal role sql servers are used for persistence of information in your database which can be retrieved mined data mined or you can query it at a later point of time the benefit of having any sql server is that data is persisted in a structured efficient manner so that it can be retrieved later quickly and meaningfully so sql server is a relational database management system in which you can create tables two-dimensional tables and connect them using referential integrity like primary key foreign key and other kind of integrity constraints you can maintain in this relational database sql server is developed and marketed by microsoft so this is a microsoft product but it is compatible with all the technologies which you want which you might be using or you might want to use like node.js java etc where you want to connect your middleware application server with microsoft sql server now what is the usage of sql server apart from the definition which i just shared with you for maintaining and building databases persistent databases there are other usages also which i'll explain you now the first one is sql server analysis service which is used to analyze data now the sql server analysis service or ssas is a multi-dimensional analysis tool that features online analytical processing provide powerful data mining capabilities and deeper dimensions to business information within a relational database multi-dimensional analysis is an online analytical processing technique olap technique that produces the ability to analyze large quantities of data by storing data in access and cells instead of traditional relational two-dimensional view in rows and columns ssas places predictive analytic capabilities in the hands of information workers by creating an instant connection to backend data using familiar applications such as microsoft excel sharepoint etc for analysis visual representation and collaboration the next is sql server reporting services which is used to generate reports now ssrs is a framework of reporting mechanisms such as the report builder report designer report manager and report server that work together through a web interface to enable the development of concise interactive reporting solutions in print or web format report builder and report designer are two ssrs components for generating reports report builder is a simple solution for the information worker or business user to create quick reports without the need to understand the core structure of the data the report designer is a tool for developers because it adds complexity to custom reports development and you create data models in it using this tool requires an understanding of the business intelligence development studio shell in visual studio and the underlying structure of the data so you have to be aware of it thoroughly according to microsoft the report server is the core process engine in ssrs that manages the processing and delivery of reports using processors the report manager is an administrative tool that controls reporting services through a web interface now let's talk about another important component which is sql server integration services ssis which is being used to perform atl operations extract transform load now ssis is the data warehousing arm of the sql server equipped with superior extract transform and load capabilities etl it provides the vehicle for moving data from different data sources to another and changing the data if necessary the three components in the ssis platform for starting the data integration process are the import and export wizard ssis designer and ssis api programming the import and export wizard simply transfer data from source to destination but does not include data transformation capabilities it's the ssis designer is an integrated component of the business intelligence development studio used for the development and maintenance of integration service packages ssis api programming module allows you to code ssis packages using any number of programming languages so there are a lot of features which are available to you in order to manage your data create your data pipeline structure it build visualization reports perform etl operations etc so it's an entire solution enterprise solution now let's see what are the different kind of sql server editions microsoft provides five additions with various tools and services and pricing options as per the needs so enough two editions of sql server which are free of charge are sql server developer and sql server express now the developer sql server edition works and function exactly like an enterprise sql edition the only difference is the license is used for testing and development purpose only this addition is generally used by developers to build and test applications on top of the sql server but they can't take it to the production sql server express edition now is the free entry level database version and is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data driven applications but not meant for any serious computation while also having incredibly limited features now the other additions are used for commercial purposes sql server web edition it is a low total cost of ownership option for web hosts and web value ad providers to provide scalability affordability and manageability capabilities for small to large scale web properties as the sql server enterprise edition delivers comprehensive high-end data center capabilities with blazing fast performance unlimited virtualization and end-to-end business intelligence enabling high service levels for mission critical workloads and end user access to data insights this version has all the features required for big data now sql server standard edition this delivers basic data management and business intelligent database for departments and small organizations to run their applications and support common development tools for on premise and cloud enabling effective data management with minimal i.t resources now let's look at some advantages of sql server instances its installation is of different versions on one machine you can maintain different installations the maintenance of production development and test environments can be done separately you can maintain a standby server so installation is streamlined it can be installed via setup wizard and the prerequisites updates are detected and downloaded by the installer automatically the complexity of the installing the software is minimized significantly because of automatic installation of updates other components such as analytical and database services can be installed separately afterwards automatic updation also reduces maintenance costs quite significantly sql server 2008 uses policy management to detect security policies that are not compliant so this feature allows only authorized personal access to the database security audits and events can be written automatically to log files ms sql server has built-in transparent data compression feature also along with encryption users don't need to modify programs in order to encrypt the data the ms sql server has access controlled coupled with efficient permission management tools further it offers an enhanced performance when it comes to data collection okay and coming to the cost reduction so it has lower cost of ownership sql server includes effective data management and data mining tools along with disk partitioning your server's optimum maintenance can be ensured by following effective data management practices these practices also help you ensure the availability and recoverability of data choose from over 300 in-demand skills and get access to 1 000 plus hours of video content for free visit scale up by simply learn click on the link in the description to know more now let's move on to creating a database in sql server so i have installed the default sql express on my machine and now i'm gonna create a database called sql tutorial so let's create a database called sql underscore tutorial okay now i will write certain queries on top of it first i'll create a table customers let's create a table customers which has columns customer id which is its primary key the name which has where care customer id is in age which is an integer gender male female will notified with one character address which is generally a large num string value so we'll keeping it back at 20 item which is varchar 15 and price okay so let's create this table okay so now if you see this table has been created dbo dot customers now all the relevant columns which i created here has been present now i have prepared a script to insert some sample values so that we can query this so i have inserted around about 20 values so let's just check whether my data is present i'll do a select star from my customer table and you can see now the 20 rows with the customer id customer name age gender address the item which the customer has purchased and the price at which he has purchased now let me show some variations of the queries which we can perform now select star means you have selected all the columns i only want to select some selective columns like customer name and gender so i can also do that you just need to give the name of the customer and the gender column next query i want to check what is the distinct values of the gender in my customer table so i will only get two values which is male and female so there is no other value apart from m and f in my customer table next i have a query where i want to find which all are the customers who have purchased an item who all are the customers who have purchased an item which is having price greater than 250 rupees okay great so out of 20 only 12 other customers who have purchased a price item which is greater than 250 and you can see all the items which are listed over here are greater than 250. next okay i want the customers who are living in new york okay fine i just have to change the where clause where instead of the price i am now looking at the address which is in new york now it is also possible that you can apply another filter okay people living in new york but age is greater than 28 perfect i only have two customers who are living in new york but having age greater than 28 or i want the female customers who are purchasing items greater than 380 rupees okay only one out of 20 okay elena now we saw examples of and condition there is also possibility that okay you want female customers or customers who are greater than age 30 so you will get both the records age greater than 30 or female customers both the records will come or customers who are in chicago or purchasing items greater than 420. so these are the examples of or conditions now let's take another example of not now i want that the customers who are not purchasing price less than 650 the reverse right greater than 650 so i'll get this answer or i want the customers who are not living in new york apart from new york any other address so all these customers are there okay so now these are the examples which i showed you are the examples where you can play around you can filter data applying the where clause now let's take another example of aggregated functions in sql now amongst the list of customers the data set of customers which i have i want to know what is the minimum age of my customer well minimum age is 18 years so one the minimum age amongst the all the customers is 18 and the maximum is i can just change it to max is 61. so the age range of my customers who are purchasing are from 18 to 61. okay now another example hypothetical example i want the average age of my customers where customer id is greater than 105 okay so if you see select star where customer id is greater than 105 i have 15 customers and amongst these my average age of my customers is 35. similarly instead of average i can take the sum total of the age above 105 which is 539 sum total okay now i'll show you an example of like i want the name i want the customers list where addresses which consist of e letter e in their address it anywhere in the string beginning in the middle because i have like is a keyword like percentage first e percentage means e can come in any part of the string okay and if i just change this example i remove the percentage from here it means that i want the customers whose addresses end with e so only pune will come into the picture okay so so this is the difference now coming select star from customers where age which between 20 and 30 so i want all the customers which have belong to age between age 20 and 30 inclusive so 20 and 30 both are inclusive so it means the customers which with age 20 and all 30 will also come in this result set next example i want the count of total customers in my uh data set which is 20 i inserted 20 so i know now i have 20 i want the count of male customers oh out of 20 19 are male okay great and if i group by now let's see an example of group by so i want the count of customers grouped by address so how many are living in boston how many in chicago detroit miami new york and pune so i have a customer wise total count total bases the address group by okay so it's a very important concept you can group by any column and then you can do a measure count account or sum an average you can do any aggregated calculation basis the other columns which are not in the group by unlike another example i want an average age per address so in boston the average age of my customer is 34 who are purchasing items chicago 35 pune 43. so like that you can do some analysis this is all data analytics now let's see another example i want to i want to filter data now after doing a group by it's not so please note this is different from where clause in where clause means filtering data before grouping having clauses used once you want to filter data after grouping so you are doing group by address count of customers and then only those cities should come where count is greater than two okay so the customers the only those addresses are listed where customers count is greater than two okay now this is an example of inner queries you want group by customer name and age only those customers having age greater than the average age of overall okay so my average age if i say my average age from customers is 36 so overall all the customers which are more than 36 should come over here listed over here and that's what has happened okay now let's talk about order by it's like sorting you want to order by address so it has ordered by by default b c d m n p which is ascending and if you apply keyword descending so it will do the reverse way similarly i can order by age which is descending higher stage first lowest below or you can do order by multiple columns where order by address descending and then same address within the same address the customers should be ascending so addresses are descending but within the address the customer names are sorted in ascending fashion a first bcd like that now there is an inbuilt function in sql server reverse if you see this has reversed the name of the customers it's in reverse fashion okay the characters are reversed another example is where you are now this is not on the table this is just a sample query where you are replacing vegetable with fruit so orange is a fruit so you have replaced vegetable with the fruit it is just uh you don't need a table you can just also write such queries where you don't need a table okay then there is a function called ltrim which is which will remove all the blanks from the left hand side r trim which will remove the blanks from the right hand side okay let me read an r trim it will remove the blanks from the right hand side and then there is trim function which will remove from both the sides left and right now let's take an example of update command i want to update the name of my customer whose customer id is 103. first let's check what's the name the customer name right now is ripple i want to change it to smith and if i read query it is changed to smith okay so this is an example of update now if i want to delete let me check who is at 101 i want to delete customer101 joseph i will delete it and now if i want to check okay there is no customer at one zero one okay now let's take one other example this is like another example of inbuilt function as sky it will give you the ascii code of the character ascii a sky 4 etc etc right so there is n number of possibilities there is n number of queries which you can write but this is just a glimpse and basic understanding of for you to get started with sql queries on sql server i hope you all had a great learning session and i hope to meet you in my next session thank you [Music] hi there if you like this video subscribe to the simply learn youtube channel and click here to watch similar videos turn

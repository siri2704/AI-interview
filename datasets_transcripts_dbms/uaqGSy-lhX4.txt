hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channel I am RTI and I'm back with another lecture in the dbms series so in the last video we learned about boys code normal form in this particular video we would be learning about fourth normal form that is 4nf so without any further Ado let's get started now what is fourth normal form so a relation is set to be in fourth normal form if it satisfies the following condition so the first condition is it should be in bcnf that is boys code normal form second is it shouldn't have any multivalue dependency now what is this multivalue dependency so multivalued dependency X determines y x determines Zed in a relation R XY Z implies that for each value of x there are a set of values of Y and set of values of Z that are independent of each other so according to multivalue dependency if x is having a multivalue dependency on y so for every value of x there would be multiple values of Y or if x is having a multivalue dependency on Z so for every value of x there would be multiple value of Z so let's understand from an example consider that there is a relation student which is having student ID student course and student phone number now one particular student can have multiple course one particular student can also have multiple phone numbers so let's see from this relation so here you can see that the student ID is one but the course he has taken is maths and the phone number is 123 again the student ID is one the course he has taken is science and the phone number is 123 now again coming to the student ID as one the course he has taken is maths but now the phone number is 345 so we can see for a student ID 1 the course is maths and Science and the phone number is 1 2 3 and 345 so you can see for a given student ID we are providing four entries now again coming to student 2 so student two has taken Hindi and English and the phone numbers are 678 and 910 so here you can see that there is so much of redent dat so let's see that how we can decompose the table and get rid of this redudant data so this was our base table or original table now it has been split into two tables and the common attribute between them is student ID so what we have done is we have split the table into student ID and course and the student ID and phone number now here you can see that student ID is only having two entries and the course is mentioned for that particular student ID and now coming to the second table it has happened in the same way that the student ID is now mentioned only two times and the phone number corresponding to the student ID is mentioned so you can see that the data red dency or data duplicacy is reduced here and since we have decomposed the table we have often normalized the table so this was all about four normal form in this particular video I hope you like this video so if you like this video please hit the like button if you're someone who is new to my channel can go ahead and watch out the tech content first and if you find it useful can go ahead and subscribe also if you have not followed me on my social media handles you can go ahead and follow the links are in the description till then take care keep learning keep growing keep smiling bye all

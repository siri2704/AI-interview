hello friends today we'll be looking into some easy steps to draw a ER diagram so the first step is to identify the entities required that is what are the entities required to draw a particular ER diagram so this step will be represented by a pink color then identify the attributes primary keys that is which are the attributes and primary keys that define the entity that is represented by black color and identify the relationship needed that is what are the relationships needed between the entities in the ER diagram that is represented by a blue color then identify the cardality ratio and participation constraint if you have seen our previous video we have explained about cardinality ratio and participation constraint in that tutorial that will be represented by golden color now let us take a example and see how to draw ER diagram by following these four easy steps so first step is to identify the entities now here I have taken example of ER diagram for bank so what are the entities that define a bank ER diagram so bank first is a bank then its branch then its employee then the customers which will be there for a particular bank and then loan facilities and then account now coming to attributes for bank what are the attributes here I have taken two attributes you can take any number of attributes as it is dependent on your choice here for bank I have taken bank name and code and the primary key I have given as code and for branch I have take branch location and branch name and branch code as the attributes and branch code as the primary key for employee I have taken employee ID designation with the manager clerk etc salary and name and employee ID as the primary key for customer I have taken customer ID customer name address and date of birth and customer ID as the primary key and loan loan number amount and rate and loan number as the primary key account number and type for account I have taken account number as the primary key so now let's see a ER diagram of bank database so here you can see the ER diagram so first step is to identify the entities so here the entities which I had taken where bank branch loan employee customer and account now the relationship so between bank and branch what is the relationship a bank has a branch so here has is relationship between bank and branch so now how will this bank and branch participate in this has relationship so now bank has branch yes bank has n number of branches but a branch belongs to only one bank so the ratio is 1 is to n now coming to participation bank participates totally in the has relationship that a bank will have a branch and a branch will belong to a bank so it is total participation for both the entities now here I have represented the primary key with the underline and the attributes and here also the primary key now coming to the next one that is bank provides loan so provides is the relationship between branch and loan a branch provides any number of loans and a loan is provided by only one bank that is a loan can be provided by different banks but for that particular branch it is provided by that branch so provides a branch can provide any number of loans but a loan belongs to only one bank now coming to the participation constraint branch participates totally in the provides relationship that is a branch will provide a loan and a loan will be provided by a bank so it is total it depends on you also whether you want to make it partial or total it is left to your choice now here I have represented loan number as a primary key so I have underlined it and amount then rate the uh interest at which loan will be given and like this now coming to branch and employee so what is the relationship between branch and employee employee works in a bank sorry branch so here for employee I have used eid as the primary key and here I have used multialued attribute name is divided into first name middle name and last name and designation i have not mentioned salary it is left to you you can write or omit it's uh totally left to you now coming to relationship works in so a employee works in a branch a branch can have n number of employees and a employee works for only one branch so now that is the cardality ratio now coming to participation constraints a employee works in a branch that is employee will work for a particular branch so the participation is total and a branch will have a employee which who works in that so it is total now coming to customer and branch the relationship between customer and branch is contains that is a branch contains customer you can write any name for the relationship it is left to you i have taken contains so now here the customer has C id as is uh uh as its primary key then customer name address and here branch as I said before now a customer sorry a branch contains many customer and a customer belongs to more than one branch a customer can have account in more than one branch also so the relationship is m is to n it can be even any uh one is to n also it is left to you now participation a branch will contain a customer and a customer will belong to a branch so the participation is total for both the entities in the relationship contains now coming to the relationship between branch and account so account has account number as a primary key and type as a attribute so now a branch maintains account so a branch participates totally in the maintenance relationship and the account also participates totally in the maintenance relationship so branch branch can contain any number of account and the account belongs to only one branch now coming to the relationship between customer and account a customer has account so here the participation of customer and account in has relationship is total that is a customer will have a account and account will belong to a customer so here a customer can have n accounts that is it can have more than one account that is if a customer is having a joint account and one more account so it is two accounts so it is represented by n here and a account belongs to more than one customer that is one customer for this account and other account so here I have given m is to n as the constraint now coming to loan and customer loan a customer aails a loan so now here the participation is partial that is a customer if he wants he can avail a loan it is not necessary that he has to avail a loan so it is partial so a loan is not availed by a customer if it is required then only we will avail it so it participation is partial the loan's participation in aail and customer's participation in aail is total that is he may or may not it is left to him so he may avail a loan now here for loan the loan number as I said is the primary key so this is all about this tutorial to explain in brief here first of all we had taken the different entities that is represented in pink then we defined the different attributes and identified the primary keys then we identified the relationship between the different entities then the cardality ratio and the participation constraints so this is all about this video thank you for watching do

ER Diagram on college management system college management system is very wide topic because  in that we have various departments,libraries, courses,exams,subjects,professors etc. but here I am taking only 7 entity sets BOOKS, STUDENTS, COURSES, EXAMS, DEPARTMENTS, SUBJECTS and FACULTY now let,s define the relationship between them relationship between student & books will be STUDENT borrows BOOKS student enrolls in course department handles course faculty teaches students faculty takes subjects faculty belongs to department department conducts exams so these are the relationships which I have defined in these 7 entities now let,s see the cardinality ratio between these entities now lets check for total & partial participation here I am taking total participation, shown by double lines becuase all entities(S1,S2,S3,..)of this entity set SUBJECT will be participating in this relationship there won,t be any subject(S1,S2,S3,..) which is not taken by any faculty.Hence,total participation or you can say all the subjects are allocated to any of the faculty but the other side I am taking partial participation.Now, you would be thinking that  all faculties(F1,F2,..)would be taking any of the subject .So, total participation but I am taking it partial participation because all faculties do not take course subjects, they take   personality development or yoga classes etc.(which are not subjects) & still a part of a college. Hence, there are faculties which wont be taking any course subject but they are for other classes like yoga etc.

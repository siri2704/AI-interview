foreign hello in this video we are going to learn dbms fundamentals and some basic SQL commands I will talk about what is a database what is rdbms rdbms terminology database normalization role of SQL and categories of SQL commands with examples I hope you learned something new in this video let's get started if you want to master dbms and SQL then click subscribe and the bell icon and let's do this together what is a database a database is an organized collection of data that is managed and accessed using software the goal of a database is to provide an efficient way to store retrieve and manipulate data databases can be used for a variety of purposes such as storing customer information tracking inventory or managing Financial records databases can be of many types such as flat file databases for example CSV or txt Excel spreadsheets relational databases distributed databases no SQL databases object-oriented databases Etc what is rdbms the concept of relational database management system was first described around 1970 by Dr EF Court in an IBM research publication called system R4 relational these are the most common types of databases and are used in a wide range of applications in a relational database data is stored in linked two-dimensional tables which are made up of rows and columns The Columns represent the attributes or fields of the data and the rows represent the individual records or tuples a user can draw relationships between multiple tables and present the output as a table again a user of a relational database need not understand the representation of data in order to retrieve it relational databases use SQL to access and manipulate the data there are many rdbms programs available both open source and proprietary including MySQL Oracle database SQL Server postgre SQL or postgres sqlite IBM db2 mariadb Etc rdbms terminology rdbms stores data in tables consisting of rows and columns and enforce relationships between these tables using keys let's briefly discuss about rdbms terminologies understanding these terms is essential for working with relational databases and writing effective SQL queries table a table is a collection of related data that is organized into rows and columns each row represents a single record or Tuple and each column represents a single attribute or field of the table column a column or attribute or field is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table row a row or Tuple or entry or record is a horizontal set of data within a table that represents a single record primary key a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table a key value cannot occur twice in one table it is used to enforce referential Integrity between tables and to ensure that each record is uniquely identified foreign key a foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table it is used to enforce referential Integrity between tables and to establish relationships between tables index and index is a data structure used to improve the performance of queries by providing a quick access path to the data in table view a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query views are used to simplify the complexity of data by hiding the underlying structure of tables transaction a transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single unit of work transactions are used to ensure the consistency and integrity of data in a database what is database normalization normalization is the process where a database is designed in a way that removes redundancies and increases the clarity in organizing data in a database so the goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies that can occur when data is duplicated or when relationships between tables are not properly defined normalization of a database helps in modifying the design at later times and helps in being prepared if a change is required in the database design normalization raises the efficiency of the database in terms of management data storage and scalability now normalization of a database is achieved by following a set of rules called forms in creating the database the most commonly used normal forms are first normal form or 1nf second normal form or 2nf and third normal form or 3nf 1nf in 1 and if each table has a primary key and all data is stored in atomic values this means that each cell in the table should contain only a single value rather than multiple values that are not related 2nf in 2nf each non-primary key attribute is fully dependent on the primary key this means that any attribute that is not part of the primary key should be dependent on the entire key rather than only part of it 3nf in CNF each non-premetic attribute is not transitively dependent on the primary key this means that any attribute that is not part of the primary key should not be dependent on any other non-primary key attribute if such a entity exists move it outside into a new table now if this CNF is achieved the database is considered normalized what is SQL in 1970s IBM researchers created a simple non-procedural language called Structured English query language or SQL this was based on Dr EF Court's design of a relational model for data storage where it described a universal programming language for accessing databases in the late 80s ANSI and ISO the two organizations dealing with standards for a wide variety of things came out with a standardized version called structured query language or SQL there have been several versions of SQL and the latest version is SQL 2016. however most database Management systems do not fully support all of its features yet additionally various database vendors also have their own proprietary extensions and features that are not part of the standard SQL language it is important to check the documentation of the specific database management system that you are working with to understand which SQL features and syntax are supported SQL is the language used to query almost all databases it's simple to learn and appears to do very little but is the heart of a successful database application understanding SQL and using it efficiently is essential in designing an efficient database application the better your understanding of SQL the more versatile you will be in getting information out of databases what can SQL do it can execute queries against database retrieve data from a database insert record in a database update records in a database delete records from a database create new databases create new tables in a database create stored procedures in a database create reviews in a database set permissions on tables procedures views Etc categories of SQL commands SQL commands can be divided into following five categories data definition language or ddl dtl commands are used to create modify and delete database objects such as tables views and indexes some common detail commands include creatable alter table and drop table for example data manipulation language or DML DML commands are used to insert update and delete data in a database some common DML commands include insert update and delete for example data query language or dql dql commands are used to retrieve data from a database the most common dql commands is Select for example data control language or DCL DCL commands in SQL are used to control access to a database and its objects and to maintain the security and integrity of the data the most common DCL commands are Grant and revoke for example transaction control language or TCL TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database the transactions are used to ensure that a group of database operations are performed as a single unit of work some common TCL commands include commit rollback and save point for example if you find this tutorial useful

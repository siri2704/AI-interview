hey everyone welcome to the first episode of our SQL tutorial series if you are new to database or looking to strengthen SQL skills you are in the right place by the end of this video you will learn what a database is and why it's important different types of databases relational versus non-reational what a DBMS is and how it works key differences between DBMS and RDBMS let's get started a database is a structured collection of data that is stored managed and accessed electronically real life examples of databases are your phone contacts an online shopping website storing customer orders a bank managing account transactions in simple terms database helps us store and organize data efficiently so we can retrieve and manipulate it when we need it there are two main types of databases let's break them one relational databases we oftenly call it as RDBMS stores data in tables that is in rows and columns uses SQL sql is nothing but structured query language to manage data examples of RDBMSR MySQL PostReSS SQL SQL Server Oracle think of it like an Excel sheet each table stores related data in an organized way second non- relational databases nosql stores data in documents key value pairs or graphs best for big data flexible schemas example MongoDB Firebase Radius nosql is useful when you don't need structured tables like storing social media posts or user activity locks if your data is highly structured go with RDBMS that is SQL if you need flexibility NoSQL might be better choice now that we have understand databases let's talk about DBMS database management system a DBMS is a software that helps us store retrieve and manage databases efficiently common DBMS features are data storage and retrieval data security and access control data backup and recovery examples are MySQL PostgresSQL SQL Server Oracle etc without a DPMS managing large amount of data would be a nightmare so let's see the difference between DBMS and RDBMS in terms of different feature first one we'll see about data storage so in DBMS it stores data as files but in RDBMS stores data in tables that is rows and columns next is data relationships dbms follows no relationships but RDBMS follows relational model tables linked with keys next see about query language no structured query language is there for DBMS but RDBMS uses SQL so DBMS is used for small scale applications rdbms is used for large complex databases where relationships between data matter since we are focusing on SQL we'll be working with RDBMS in this series before we wrap up let's answer an important question why should we learn SQL because SQL is everywhere used by developers data analysts and even business professionals it's essential for working with databases in web and mobile apps one of the most in demand tech skills today so mastering SQL opens doors to jobs in software development data science and more awesome now you have a solid understanding of databases and DBMS if you found this helpful give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more SQL tutorials if you have any questions drop them in the comments i would love to help see you in the next video and happy learning

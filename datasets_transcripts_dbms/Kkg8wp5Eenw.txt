so hello everyone welcome back to the channel so today we are going to discuss a very important thing about pbms which is database management system so we all know that databases are the backone of modern applications from banking system to social media platforms but you know that choosing the right databases can dramatically affect performance scality and security as well so in today's video uh we will explore everything uh like what is database management system dbms uh types of dbms that is rdbms andq dbms plus we also discuss when to use rdbms and versus no SQL along with real world samples plus we will also be looking into future PLS in databases and how companies handle big data so did you know that Facebook Amazon Netflix do not use traditional data basis uh for everything they rely on noise SP dat scalability stun uh to find out why they rely on nosql databases so we we actually post you know the job updates also on our for channel plus we are you know coming up with a data analy Series in this particular video so don't forget to subscribe to a channel if you want best St in your career so um all right let's get started so first introduction thing is like what is dbms so basically a database management system is a software that enables users to store retrieve update and manage data you can store and R three also and what else you can do update updation also there uh they are like update is one kind of f SQL uh there will be you know like DML command called as update so with the help of that dat dvms software what it software is what it is a software that enables user to store retrieve update and manage data efficiently you can manage it efficiently like where to use how to use when to use so all these things you can do with the help of dbms which is database management system so for example uh let's uh come to let's show you some example so uh for example uh let's see you have stuck in a book store right uh you own this book store entire book store and you need to keep a track of the book in stack right you can see so many books are there right so and also you have to keep track of the customers and the purchases along with the salary revenues of the particular books so without a proper database managing this is going to be Chate uh that's why where dbms comes into picture so it what it will do you know it will store the unorganized data efficiently for example the records of the book the sales the revenues made everything you can store it uh which is not easy or efficient to write it in a you know kind of register or something like that so it will allow the multiple users to access and update data simultaneously it all depends on the access management thing what access you have given to the other people so it all depends on that but not all data database work the same way let's explore the two databases right so first is rdbms which is relational database management system it is relational data right so relational database management system is basically in the form of structur or table so what you'll do here structure table it will be in the form of a table and follows acid principle what is acid principle that I will discuss in next next video but as of now you can just understand that it's basically acid means atomicity consistency isolation and durability it is a it's actually a process of transaction for example I'll give you I will not go that depth into that because I'm going to cover it so we can just understand that for example you are transferring a money to your friend or you are going to pay to some shopkeeper so with the help of this uh process this you know rdms either the process is completed or it is canceled for example either the payment is directed from your mobile I mean from your bank account and going into other this bank account or it is not done at all it won't be like okay money got DED but it didn't reach the you know the receiver but it's not like that right so this is how transaction works I mean the AC property of rdbms this is the actual the process of that and uh uh and adms is basically stores you know the data and structure table with predefined schema so you can think of rdbms like an Excel seat you might have seen Excel seat right so it will store in the form of like table right it will be table some kind of so it will store everything like a table you can enter the number the data for example you can store if you are a teacher the professors or something like that you can store the students data right their marks uh their cgps all that so this thing can be recorded in rows and columns right and each row represents a record we call them record for example a customer right so and each column in database we call uh it it will represent example uh see in database we call column as field right and row as record so field can be anything right for example uh age phone number name so all this can be a field and Records can be the customers or the students if you are scoring up with students so let's understand little bit key features of rdbms so the key features of rdms will be like you know uh it uses SQL uh I think you might have heard about SQL which we call SQL as well and the full form of SQL is structured query language um it's Sur the name structured query language because it is used to fix the structure data right and query language means it's used to write query to fch the data from the database so basically is a this language I will go deep into that and we will solve some problem as well but as of now you just understand this is a query language which is used to Vis this query to face the data from the database uh that's it as of now is fine and uh also one more key feature of dbms is so features you can say first is equal it uses and second is IS F follow acid property follows acid property acid property I already discussed over here right atomac consistency isolation inability isolation basically means your and your if some other person is doing the transaction at the same time so you both your both trans transaction would be isolated from each other to you know because it will give you privacy I mean your details won't get leaked so that is how it works and one more property of of features of rdbm is that it's bested for structure data in comp bested for a structure data so these are the uh three properties or this uh you can say the three features of rdmm and let's understand the examples uh so example of rbms you can see like I I already gave an example of banking system right uh for example of banking system ensure that money transfers are accurate right and if you transfer for example 1,000 rupees from your account to your friend account the database must be accurity to it must display the correct information so that is one real world example of rdbms that money debited from one account and it should createit to your friend's account right how how I gave you an example right so it's you for example and you are sending money to your friend so it should dep deposit to the your friend's account right and if any failure occurs the entire transac is roll back if the for example it's got cancelled by any any external process either the internet connection or some other issues so the entire process should be rolled back I mean the money should come back to your account it should not stuck somewhere else right so this is how our dbms works and it is one of the very good real world example of that so that's where you know rdms signs data consistency and reliability but what about you know applications that need scalability and speed so that's where no SQL comes in because it's more consistent and reliable especially if you need you know uh other datas like the data is if the data is not structured so now let's Deep dive little bit on nosql as well so unlike rdms nosql databases are schema less and designed for handling huge amounts of data at lightening speed um it's known for its speed just uh not down some basic steps I mean basic properties it's it's speed it will you know uh it will handle huge amount of data at lightning speed it can handle very large amount of data and that also with very good speed so for example uh imagine social media platform let's say Instagram Instagram and you are it will receive millions of post right daily and comments as well along with the like every second side so storing this is in a structure table will slow down the system don't you feel so because with how long it will become if you store it in a table like format isn't it that complex process so what they will do we will use uh Instagram for example uses no SQL databases like mongod TV so no SQL database example that we are going to study is mongodb so nowadays it's you might have you guys might have hard about take stack like mon right uh so what does that mean what what stands for M Bongo TV right and E for expresss R fors and fors so these These are so famous nowaday the reason being that it's very fast plus it is very reliable and it can handle the database with lightning speed so this is our and not just that it can even you know uh note down all like for example audio files video files and all that kind of f which is not possible to store in rdbms kind of structure or table like structure so now let's understand little bit key features of uh no bu databases that we discussed over here there in rdvs now we'll discuss for a noise bu database it can handle unstructured and semi structure data right along with highly scalable for Big Data applications it is used for Big Data applications plus uh half speed faster we can say faster and one more thing we can say that schema flexibility like you can change data anytime data can change dynamically you don't have it's not going to be static right you can change it dynamically so this is how it's different and it's features are different from rdbms which is struct strcture database which follows structure it can store both structure and semi structure sorry unstructured and semi structure but rdbms can store only structured databases so that's it about that and let's understand little bit about the types of noq databases uh like there will be like you know document based for example mongodb that I just told and some other are like also that like column family base like Cassandra and all that databases but that's again high level things and we will be going depth into that then we'll discuss all that um now let's come to the real world example of Mong now like how I gave for um rdbms right rdbm is what I get Bank retail transactions right the same way the real world example of we can see for noise is uh for example let's say Netflix right Netflix uses no SQL database called as Center I just mentioned right the stream movies without lag uh if you use for example rdmm is it possible to store so many things like watch history and everything and all no right so they use nois database and uh the database name is cassendra uh so it will it will not lag right lag me you already know what you mean right it will not get Disturbed while playing the music so for example uh it stores the data like uh which episode you watched uh which episode you watch watch History watch history and personalized recommendation like how you get personalized recommendation to which source to watch right on Netflix so these all are done with the help of no SQL databases this is the real master behind that so uh because traditional databases can't handle such a high volume of data workload that I already mentioned right so now let's cck differences we can find uh like you can see on your screen right there are differences between rdbms and noise dbms so data structure rdbms uses structure tables but they support various data format same schema flexibility I told right Rd has a fixed schema it's not Dynamic static it is already fixed and but then you can change this uh with time and with your requirement so that is why it's kind of better scalability maybe you can see that rdb is typically scale vertically no SQL designed for horizontal scale so these are the kind of differences of rdbms and no rdbms use cases you can see here RDM is has for structure data that I already told but that is suitable for web applications and real time you know web application all that so this was all about or that differences now when to use rdbms so for example you have highly structured data structure data then you will use rdbms and for example banking HR and strong data integrity and consistency if you want strong consistency in data banking I already mentioned right you need consistency in that plus complex queries in transactions complex queries is there then you use rdbms and now let's let directly jump to no SQL database so as this one we have completed right when to use structure data data Integrity when data consistent Integrity you required then you'll use RPMs and you have to establish standard like if you want to establish a standard in the database then you will use rdbms now directly come to noq database when to use that so as you can see on your screen right uh when you need a high speed real time of Big Data managing large volume of data uh large volume of data or rapid development means if you need fast right quick iterations and change in data structure needed if you need the work to be done fast you'll use noise sped database plus High through output high speed data processing data processing should be high then you need noise speed databases for example I you just mentioned right the entertainment service like Netflix user because they need high speed data processing uh and flexible data model that you can change anytime accommodate various data formats like if you need various data formats application then you will use that so this is all about when to use nosql and uh ADM databases so now yeah this was all about the about the two different types of databases database management system which was rdbms and nosql database so now many companies combine rdps and noise SP for maximum efficiency hyrid databases like Google spanner and AWS Dynamo are sa in the future to choose the right database depends on your to case scalability needs and performance requirements so that's was all about the this important point and like share and comment below if you what is your thought about this particular uh video and especially the differences between rdbms and no what do you understand the difference between uh these two and if you have some extra point to add that as well so that we all can learn from that and if you have not subscribed to our channel

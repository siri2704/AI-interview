hey guys hope you guys are doing well and this is michael and here we're here to do in this position looking at um sql versus nosql a sequel versus nosql and from this at least from this picture we can find that the sql is more structured whereas okay they're both structured but uh sql is more structured than nosql more data sets and i'm going to div into that just a bit so basically sql is more relational database management system well so basically what happens here is you could have sets of different uh data linked to one another so let's say for instance you've got an order is linked to a product linked to a price and linked to some other piece of information that's necessary um as you can see if you have let's say a couple of tables that just for one or you can imagine having millions of orders how taxing that can be for any system whereas no no sql has basically a key and a value so the key is basically it could be it completes a bar code or some designated number that is specific to a value that now basically gives you let's say in this example would be you click on a key and then it just gives you the the system just knows this is gives you this value which could be that value could be documented this contains basically the price name of product other features so as you can see you can have way more um storage capacity as compared to nosql yeah so i guess from that like that i wasn't prepositioned i was agreement on the fact that rather with the argument that no sequel has been taking over so some of the reasons uh doesn't require him investment like sql databases so simply the fact that you could actually you don't need to you don't need to um once or you don't need to have a strict data set arrangement format means basically uh you don't have to because you don't have to buy you know new servers to put in your data and then have to set up all the servers again to match your specific requirements which that that processor that was expensive from buying to the labor costs and could be also time consuming and will definitely run faster than sql databases simply because it only has two sets of important values as compared to sql you could have this even five um either the developers have better sale yep just two values alone that's it you don't need to have too many things um easily scalable as compared to the scale definitely because you don't you don't have to it's not as time-consuming as sql not to mention you could easily you know um companies i said looking for could easily offer also could easily outsource this this this um this uh it's a database so that's that this is the things like what amazon web services does nowadays and also the company is competing for for um in the market also um can't run well on cloud yeah because you don't need too much data or at least it's not too it's not behaving on any system yeah so those are those are some of the reasons as to why i thought uh nosql would do better than what other will in future replace um sql also not to mention i think uh sql has had probably more time in the market to prove itself while there's no sequel as time goes by we'll continue making improvements and probably uh i suspect that would will okay not sure i would but it would replace some uh mysql so thank you guys this is the end hope you enjoyed the video feel free to correct me if i made a mistake or you can add on anything that you think i have missed

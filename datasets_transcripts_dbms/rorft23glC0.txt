[Music] hello everyone welcome back the most awaited topic of this chapter The Entity relationship diagram which is also called as simply ER diagram let's step into the topics of the day what we are going to learn in this presentation we are going to understand the entity relationship diagram which is the ER diagram and also we are going to understand this ER diagram with the help of the basic structure and components of the ER model while waiting let's step into the topic of the day the ER diagram as I mentioned ER diagram means it is the entity relationship diagram we know what is an entity and we know how relationship is also formed among entities so this diagram is going to basically involve the entities and the relationship among the entities and we also have seen the basic components of the ER model which which are the entity sets the attributes and the relationship sets let's start with the basics of this ER diagram now basically this ER diagram is used to express the overall logical structure of a database we have already seen about the ER model which is mainly used for expressing the overall logical structure of a database and we know ER model is a high level data model and basically this ER diagram is a graphical representation so it is depicted or portrayed as diagrams so er model when it is portrayed as diagrams they are represented as ER diagrams and that is why it is mentioned that this is a graphical representation and as I mentioned a picture is a worth of thousand words so it's easy to understand things with the picture and that to when it involves a lot of complexities instead of having a written or a verbal communication if things are represented with the help of diagrams it has more advantages and hence these are simple and clear while looking at the diagram itself we will be able to understand how many relations are there I mean how many tables are there what are the attributes in the table how relationships are formed among the entities which is a primary key attribute is there any weak relationship Etc and because of its Simplicity and the very clear nature of depicting the things it has a widespread usage in the database deployment areas we are done with the basics of ER diagram let's step into the notations that are used in the ER diagram when we talk about entities The Entity set is actually represented using rectangle and if it is a single rectangle it means it is a strong entity set and when things are represented with double rectangle then it is a weak entity set don't worry about this what is a strong entity set and what is a weak entity set now anyway I'm going to show you some examples shortly that time I will explain you what is strong entity set and what is weak entity set with some examples so this is about the entity set and what about the relationship when we have strong entity set and weak entity set we also do have strong relationship and weak relationship when relationship is expressed with a single Diamond it is strong relationship if it is depicted with two diamonds or a Double Diamond it is a weak relationship anyway when we understand strong entity and weak entity that time I will explain you what is strong relationship and what is weak relationship just recollect what are the basic components of ER diagram or ER model The Entity sets the relationship what is missing attributes and these attributes in ER diagram are represented like this we have already seen about this in the previous presentation single oval it is simple attribute or single valued attribute and composite attribute is represented like this multivalued attribute is represented with double oval and derived attribute is expressed with dotted oval and remember we also have null values in the attribute level so these are the notations that are used in the ER diagram in order to understand things clearly let's see few examples and things will be easy for you to understand let me show you a part of the ER diagram here it is this instructor is an entity student is an entity instructor and student have advice is relationship so in instructor advises student and what are the attributes of instructor relation the instructor ID name and salary what are the attributes of student entity student ID name and credits earned so this is how actually an ER diagram is represented now when you look into this it is a simple rectangle and it is a simple diamond symbol so it means this is a strong entity and this is also a strong entity and if we represent with double I mean double rectangle or Double Diamond then it is a weak entity or weak relationship let's see that shortly there are some conventions that represents ER diagram like this but in this lecture series I'm going to represent the same kind of ER diagram like this can you see here I'm going to represent entity and attributes like this so the first half is the instructor which is the name of the entity set like here and the attributes are represented like this ID name and salary which are the attributes ID name salary here and the same advises relationship here and the equivalent for this entity student is represented like this student with the attributes ID name and credits can you see here ID name and credits and again this is a strong relationship only because it is represented with single Diamond if it is Double Diamond then it is a weak relationship now you may be wondering what is a strong relationship and what is a weak relationship let me explain that now let me take the same a diagram and go to a new page in order to depict this so let me focus on only this part now when you look into this this is an ER diagram that has only two relations or two tables or two entities to be precise instructor entity and student entity and what is the relationship it is advises relationship I mean instructor advises student I'm going to bring in something from the previous lecture can you recollect this we have seen the basic structure and components where the relationship among the entities are depicted if you are directly watching this lecture I request you to watch my previous lecture I mean part two of the ER model in order to understand things better this is the entity set instructor and this is the entity set student and we have advises relationship and the same is here the instructor entity set student entity set and advises relationship now what is additional here the date attribute that gives more information about the relationship when the relationship is formed I mean on what date this instructor is assigned as the adviser for this particular student let me take John John is appointed as the instructor for Jennifer on third of May 2024 now there is an attribute here and what attribute is this it's a date attribute that gives more information about this relationship isn't it how this is represented in ER diagram we are going to use dotted lines with the attribute date in order to tell the relationship attribute what is this relationship and what attribute it is date attribute that tells or gives more information about the association when the instructor is assigned as the adviser to the student so what is this diagram this is the attribute attached to the relationship set what is the relationship set the advises is the relationship set that has an attribute that is attached to this relationship set isn't it so we use dotted lines in order to represent this remember what is a dotted line it is an attribute attached to a relationship set what is this it's a line line means it is used to connect the entity with the relationship set or the relationship set with the entity so two entities are associated with the help of relationship set and lines are used to connect the entity with the relationship set so remember two types of lines are here the dotted line and the straight line so dotted lines are to connect the attribute with the relationship set so attribute attached to the relationship set is represented using dotted line and straight line is used to connect the entity or entity set with the relationship let's see another example and what we are going to see now the strong entity set if you see the relationship is with single Diamond so obviously this is a strong relationship and at the same time if you see here this is also single rectangle only so this is a strong entity set and this is also strong entity set now we need to understand what is a strong entity set when an entity has a primary key attribute then it is a strong entity set because this entity set is not depending on any other entity because it has a primary key attribute which helps in identifying the records uniquely similarly coming to this entity set student we also have a primary key attribute here so the relationship that is formed between two strong entity set is going to be a strong relationship only and that is why this relationship is a strong relationship I hope now you are able to understand what is a strong entity set the entities in the strong entity set are not dependent on other entity also it will have a primary key attribute let's now see the weak entity set here is an example for weak entity can you see here it is represented using Double Diamond so when it is represented with Double Diamond it is a weak relationship and also what are new things here this is a strong entity set but this is a weak entity set the reason is there is no primary key attribute and the attributes are underlined with dashed lines so from this it's clear that there is no primary key attribute like this attribute in this course relation however in section there is no primary key attribute since there is no primary key attribute this is a weak entity set so the relationship formed between a strong entity set and this weak entity set is a weak relationship also we have double light what does it mean this is dealing with the participation whether it is a total participation or an optional participation or partial participation don't worry about this now we have an exclusive lecture that deals with participation so for now just understand double lines deals with with total participation the entities present in the entity set must compulsorily participate in at least one entity in the relationship anyway I will explain more about this later also we have an arrowed line here there are some conventions that uses arrowed line to represent the cardinality ratio or the cardinality number but in this lecture series we are going to represent something different because here the exact numbers cannot be specified anyway in the coming presentation you are going to understand about the mapping cardinalities in diagram for now just understand this is a weak relationship This Is the participation related and this is cardinality related so this example is for a weak entity set because this entity set has no primary key attribute also the attributes are dependent on a strong entity set in order to ensure its existence when we see an example for ER diagram we will be able to know things better since we are going to deal about the participation in the coming presentation I'm going to ignore this for now what about this this is actually the cardinality ratio isn't it so here instructor and student are having a relationship instructor advises student and what is the cardinality ratio this is represented with some numbers here so no worries this is the way to represent the cardinality limits in the next presentation I will tell you the numbers here and how it differs when we give numbers here and here so this is how cardinality limits are represented in the ER diagram let's see the next example here is an example of an instructor entity this instructor entity has ID name address phone number date of birth age and salary as the attributes I request you to pause this video for a while and compare this with the type of attribute that we have seen in the recent lecture I hope you are done from this we can say this is a primary key attribute this is a composite attribute right so name has first name middle name and last name what about the attribute address this is a complex attribute because it has Street and Street has Street number street name and apartment number and what are the other attributes in the street it's city state and zip zip or postal code so remember this is a composite attribute under another composite attribute and what about this phone number we have seen this phone number is a multivalued attribute so multivalued attributes are represented using this flow brackets and what about date of birth this is a single valued attribute this is simply mentioned just like that single valued attribute or even simple attributes what about this age this age is a derived attribute from which attribute this age can be derived from this date of birth attribute and that is why age is represented with parenthesis meaning it is a derived attribute what about salary this is a simple attribute because this is atomic in nature which cannot be decomposed into further components or further values so salary is a simple attribute which is just like that represented so what we understand from here is this is how an entity is represented with different types of attribute now I want to show one more thing here which is this we have only one entity which is course which has course ID as the primary key attribute which has other attributes like title and credits and we also have a relationship and this relationship is a strong relationship only and the relationship is prerequisite is it a binary relationship no a binary relationship is formed between two entity sets but here we have only one entity and we have this relationship achieved with the help of course ID and prerequisite ID then what kind of relationship is it it is recursive relationship I will elaborate about this recursive relationship in the a diagram examples but for now I will just give you only few things let's say there are two courses here course one and course two let's say course two that requires course one as a prerequisite let's say if one student has to undergo course two then course one should have been completed in that case course one and course two are interl so that course two can be complet if and only if course one is completed and that is why these kind of relationship are represented as recursive relationship I'm not articulating more about this because we are going to see that when we see some examples in the ER diagram now let me show you another example just tell me is it an attribute or an entity it is an entity right if it is an attribute we have already seen in this presentation it is connected with a dotted line so that this is a descriptive attribute we have seen date as an example but here this is Project which is an entity set not an attribute like instructor like student and these three are strong entities and that is why we have a strong relationship now what this example is all about this is an example for tary relationship because this relationship is formed between three entities instructor project and student remember the third entity is connected with the help of dotted lines because this exist only when these two exist remember these dotted lines or dashed lines are used to link attributes of a relation to the relationship set or it is used in a tary relationship and that's it guys what are the topics we have seen in this presentation we have seen the entity relationship diagram which is the ER diagram with various notations that are used in the ER diagram and also we have understood the basic structure and components of the ER model with the help of some examples in E diagram I hope the session is informative and thank you for watching [Applause] [Music]

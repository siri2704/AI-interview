hi guys now let's solve some pyqs on the r model so let's take a look at the first pyq which is from gate CSC 2024 so let the specification be instructor teaches courses student register for courses courses are allocated classrooms and instructor guides students okay so which of the following diagrams correctly represent the above specification okay so they have given you four diagrams and now you have to tell which one of this correctly represents the specification that has been given okay so let's see this so the instructor teaches course okay then student registers for the course so let's start looking at one of uh each one of them and see if they fit the description that has been given to us so instructor teaches the course right so this is correct so this is correct relationship the instructor is teaching the course so this is correct student registers for the course so now this registration that they have given right they have given it as a um as an entity right but it should be a relationship between the course and the uh student entity right so also student should be an entity over here right so here this is the flaw right so this is not correct student should not be a relationship it should be a entity right so this is incorrect so this option is incorrect now let's look at the second option so instructor teaches course so this is correct now we have um project registers on course right so this is the relationship that they have given project is an entity registration and course right but student registers for the cods right so here there is no mention of the student entity at all right so this is also incorrect right so this relationship is incorrect because it should have been a relationship between course and the students right the students should register for some course okay so this is incorrect again instructors guide the students so this relationship is also incorrect because instructors are not guiding projects instructor are guiding uh students so these two things these three things are incorrect so this is also incorrect now let's look at the third option so we have instructor teachers course this is fine we have student registers for course this is also fine instructor guide students this is also fine now we have classroom course and allocation right now this is incorrect right this is incorrect because so classroom is allocated course so this should have been like this right classroom and course would have the relationship allocation which is not there so this is also incorrect right so this should be the one which is correct but let's see we'll verify whether this is correct or not then we'll take it so we have instructor teaches course which is fine student registers for the course which is also fine instructor guides the student awesome and then you have classroom allocation and student so course and classroom are allocate are related with the relationship allocation so this is also correct so the answer is fourth one which is the D option so the answer is D fine okay now let's look at the next one from the gate CSC 2024 so in the context of owner and weak entity sets in the ER data model which of the following statements is true okay so they have given you four statements and they're asking you which of the following is true okay so let's see each one of them one by one so the weak entity set must have total participation in the identifying relationship okay so this we know is right right so the weak entity set must have a total participation always right because that weak entity is dependent on the identifying entity or the owner entity for its identification so hence this is correct right so this a statement is correct now they have asked us which of the following statements is true but we should check the other one also so this is McQ but let's check why the other options are incorrect so the owner entity must have total participation in the identifying relationship so this is not correct right owner entity need not participate completely in the identifying relationship for example if you have a relationship between employee and dependent depends on or say there there is a dependent relationship uh employee has dependents right so one of the so this is the owner entity here owner entity here this is the weak entity here right so here what you have is this relationship has and these are two entities over here so an employee cannot have some dependence right so it might happen that some of the employee does not have any dependence for example the uh so there could be reasons why the employee does not have dependence so if that happens then employee need not participate in this relationship any employee right so this uh B option is incorrect so both weak and owner entities must have total participation in the identifying relationship this is incorrect right because we know that owner entity need not participate totally in the identifying relationship and neither weak nor or owner entity must have total participation this is also incorrect because we know that weak entity should have a total participation in the um identifying relationship fine so the answer is a okay fine now let's look at the next question which is from gate CSC 2012 given the basic ER and relational models which of the following is incorrect again this is an McQ question but we will check every option okay okay so based so we have to use e Knowledge from ER model and the relational models so an attribute of an entity can have more than one value right so an attribute of an entity can have more than one value so this is correct right so an entity can have more than one value right so we know that say student is there right so this student can have a multi valued attribute so this is allowed in the ER model so it can have say phone number which is multivalued right so this is allowed an attribute of an entity can be composite this is also fine we have seen this in the ER model so these this is related to ER model this is also related to ER model in a row of a relation table now they are talking about the relational model so they're saying in a row of a relation table an attribute can have more than one value so this we know is false right so in relational data model we cannot have multiple values in a single attribute right so we can't have multiple value attributes in the relation model so that's why this option is incorrect let's take a take a look at D option in a row of relation table an attribute can exact can have exactly one value or a null value so this is correct right so based on the domain we can either have exactly one value or the null value so this is correct so the only option which is incorrect is C option fine so the answer is C okay now let's take a look at the last pyq so gat 2008 uh they asking us consider the following ER diagram they have given you a very nice ER diagram you have to find the minimum number of tables that are needed to represent m n p R1 R2 okay so you have m p and N there are three entities you have two relations okay so let's see so this is a strong entity okay so this is a strong entity so we are definitely going to have one relation for this so this let's say I'll have I'll say one relation for so we'll have definitely have one relation for M right M will have relation right now this m relation does not have any multivalued attributes or any uh multiv Val attributes so we don't need not break it down so M will have one relation okay now let's take a look at this P entity okay so p is also a strong entity because it has a primary key right so this P entity will also have one relation fine so this is relation two now let's take a look at n entity so an N entity is a weak entity how do we know it's a weak entity because it's in a double square also it's connected to a double rhombus or a diamond right so this is a weak relationship or this is called identifying relationship identifying relationship right so this is identifying relationship and we have seen how to we convert this to a relation model what we'll do is we'll have the table for this P entity we'll have the table for this n entity and we'll add the primary key of this P entity into this we entity and as a foreign key and that will help us in identifying the relationship right we'll have a composite key of N1 N1 is basically the partial key partial key of this we entity and so we have to create one table for this as well so we'll create one table for this as well so we have relation three right so this R2 relation it does not need a table does not does not need explicit table table right another thing that you should ensure is that the weak entity should be in total participation it is right so this is correct now the only thing that we have to worry about is R1 right so R1 R2 doesn't need an explicit table so does R1 needs an explicit table so let's try to understand this so this is in total participation right so this is in total participation and this is in uh partial participation so this is the many side right so this is n right and this is one so this is many to one relationship right so now for the many to one relationship if you are going to convert this we'll put the uh primary key the foreign key in the uh manyu side right so what we can do is if you have this m table we'll have M where we'll have M1 M2 M3 right M3 so here we have this P table right which has P1 P2 so we'll make this P1 here we'll get this P1 here on the many side anyways this is in total participation so we will get this and this will reference this particular uh primary key right so this is the primary key and this is a foreign key so this will reference this right so we can do this we have seen this in um many to so this is many to one relationship so we always put the primary key or sorry the foreign key on the mini side so we'll put it here so this relationship R1 also doesn't need an explicit relation right and they're asking us about the minimum right so uh there can be null values in this so we don't care anyways this is in total participation so there will be no null values over here so um this R1 doesn't need doesn't need explicit table okay so how many tables do we need we need three tables one for m one for p and 1 for n and obviously We'll add some foreign key constraints to represent R1 and R2 so the answer is B B okay so the answer for this particular question is B okay

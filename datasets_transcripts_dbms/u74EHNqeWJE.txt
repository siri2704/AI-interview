in this video I want to introduce you to Chats 2D it's an innovative open- source AI SQL client that allows users to interact with databases using natural language it supports both SQL and NoSQL databases and has gained over 21,000 GitHub stars in recent updates in version 3 it has greatly enhanced its AI capabilities making it even more powerful for addressing the challenges data professionals face daily so now let's set the stage today teams working with data often need to use multiple database tools each with its own interface and capabilities across connections working with queries debugging issues data analysis and visualization and performance tuning this constant switching frustrates developers and slows down work chat2db 3.0 provides a comprehensive set of AI capabilities to help with support for over 30 databases and integration with the top AI models like Cloud 3.7 Sonnet and Deepseek you can work with one or more databases at the same time and with the same consistent user experience for all the powerful AI capabilities let's see these capabilities in action the first step is downloading a client uh you can select from Windows Mac or Linux i'm on Windows so I've downloaded the client installed locally and I've signed into my trial pro account so after downloading I've started the client and I'm going to create a new database connection so I'm going to go to here new connection as you can see there are many different kinds of databases that I can connect to so for this example I'm just going to start with my progress SQL database i'll select that and I'm going to enter different parameters i'll just select a test environment and the host I'm going to use user password and the user name is this i'll type in my password and then postress database and I'm going to now connect to it all right I'll test the connection and the test connection is successful and I'll save it all right so after I connect to it I can see the tables in my database so I'll expand you can see the tables i have several tables uh customer analytics customer behaviors purchases so I'll go ahead and open up my SQL copilot and start a new session and I'm going to connect to my database so I'll go here and connect there all right I'm going to do some uh data discovery so the question I'm going to ask is what are some questions I can ask to discover uh data insights all right I'll select that all right so it's taken a look at all the tables I have and started to suggest some questions based on the tables all right i'll ask the question which customers have the highest lifetime value so it's analyzing the input matching it to the tables and then genu generating a SQL query and then providing you with the information and a visualization i can go to the settings and change the theme color change things like uh order by and then save it and I can also pin this to a dashboard so I created a dashboard called business insights and add that into my dashboard so that it appears here and as I add more things I can have a custom dashboard that refreshes as my data refreshes okay I'm going to ask a follow-up question because I've noticed that Maria Garcia has the highest lifetime value so I want to take the context and be able to drill down further to illustrate also the idea that uh is context aware as well as you can do multi-turn so I'll go ahead and ask give me the purchase history for Maria Garcia all right right once again the AI is analyzing the input looking at the purchases and customer analytics creating the SQL automatically and then giving you the data so just like before you can pin this into our dashboard so let's go ahead and pin this into my business insight dashboard and say okay and now as the data changes this dashboard will reflect uh the data now our SQL copilot can also generate uh code that allows me to uh access uh this data in a rest API so I'm just going to ask it generate Python code that allows me to access my data via REST API and then see what it does all right so then it's uh going to start writing code for me and it's going to build the rest API uh using Flask so I can just take this code and then put that in a server and then I'll be able to access this uh Postgress database so far we've been using the Cloud Sonnet 3.7 models but there's a lot of other uh models available uh including DeepSeek that uh can be used all right now let's turn our attention to another feature set so this is going to be the SQL editor so I'm going to go to my my tables and then I'm going to rightclick and I'm going to look at the query console right the uh SQL editor is uh where I can use my AI capabilities to work directly with SQL so what I can do first is say slash and then uh type my query all right so it's going to understand which table we need to uh work with and then uh give me an example of an SQL that gets that information so I can go ahead and run that and we have Maria Garcia now we can use this formatting so there's formatter to format that nicely and then uh there's also an ability to use uh this uh content assist so I can say CA dot and then it gives me additional fields and sign update and I can run it again and when I look at this I can see that there's an error so I can fix it in chat all right that's great so let's copy that and paste it here and then run again all right next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to be generating some additional test data so this is a test database so I'll go into one of my tables and this is um my customer analytics table so it has the name customer ID email sign up date and loyalty tier so I'm going to add more test data to this so I'll go here select generate test data and the AI is going to take a look at this table here make sure that uh the types and all uh are appropriate and then generate SQL for that and then what I can do after it's generate the SQL is go ahead and just run it right so I'll go ahead and run it and it's successful and I'll just go ahead and see that and then I have new test data so next thing we're going to do is to generate some Java code and I'm going to generate a uh create read update and delete Java code from one of my tables so from the customer analytics table so this uh um copilot is uh contextaware and is able to understand the schema so we'll go ahead and generate the Java code so we generated Python code before i'm going to show how it's also able to j uh generate Java code that you can use directly to access elements of this customer analytics uh table right so it's generating all the access classes as well as methods so one last feature I want to show is the table co-pilot so I can go and use AI to help me create new tables so I going to go create table and select the table copilot i'm going to create a new table for customer engagement metrics and I'm going to uh give it some fields and I'm I haven't told it any particular uh value for these fields or types for these fields but I'll just select this and it's created some SQL for me that I can start executing so I'll go ahead and do that and I'm going to take a look at engagement metrics so I'll save that get my engagement metrics here right so I've done this and I'll just populate it by generating some test data all right and I'll run this SQL and refresh to wrap up we've been able to show the power of Chat 2DB which is an AI powered SQL client with a SQL co-pilot AI SQL editor the ability to generate code from the schema all within a GUI based environment uh doing data analytics that you can see visually best of all everything that we did with the Postgress database we can do across all these database in exactly the same way

hey guys so today we'll discuss about the online test of CAP Germany which is the most most most important and crucial part to be the part of CAP Germany and I hope you all get placed in CAP Germany and meet me in the CAP Germany office so the first thing is that online test which contains the these starting four section which will be technical round essay writing or MCQ based on them and psychometric test which is basically uh faced by off-c campus people's not an on campus but if capy put it in on campus also then you have to do it and the next is game based aptitude okay so the first is uh technical round this in this section you will contain more two sections that is pseudo code and IT fundamentals okay for pseudo code there will be 25 questions and the time allotted will be 25 minutes and for IT fundamentals number of questions will be 15 and the time allotted will be 15 and you can switch any of the section anytime so no need to worry about that and it is the elimination round means in first round this section is most important okay the pseudo code will contain bitwise operations conditional statements loops and DSA MCQs okay so you have to practice these type of things and please go through these type of questions so that you can't face any problem during your test because cheating is not that the solution guys you have to be prepared also so bitwise operation conditional statements and loops uh please visit and see the previous year questions and whatever you can do take help and all okay after that computer fundamentals in computer fundamentals uh you will face the questions on data structures like binary tree min and max heaps stacks along with the concept in computer networks computer uh cloud computing DVMS and cryptography and guys I would suggest please please to so that you will get in cap Germany okay this round is uh means the second section round not guys in first round you will face all these section so in the second section you will face the English uh questions it can be the essay writing or it can be the MCQ based they will decide so you have to keep in mind of both anyone can you face okay so some student gets uh easy essay essay writing or some gets MCQ okay some student get essay writing and some get English MCQ so it depends which one you will get okay so essay writing is an also elimination round you will have 15 minute to write an essay and the essay limit will be 180 to 220 words and guys whatever the limit of the word please write five to 10 words less than the limit and check spelling before submitting it is the most crucial part and the grammatical mistake should be not there okay and the back space is no more considered as the negative marking uh and pattern should be like this first you have to write introduction then body and then conclusion okay and if you face the English MCQ based question then there will be paragraph uh and you have to answer on the basis of paragraph there will be some English vocabulary grammar questions and some mismatched question grammar uh and other type of means whatever English can contain this type of question you will face okay and psychometric test this is basically organized for off-c campus and if you are preparing for on campus then it might be a chance that you will face this but um because in 2025 they have also mentioned for um peopleles of 2025 to be face the behavioral round or psychometric round this is basically guys you have to put yourself as a colleague and team lead and then think of the questions what is the right and wrong for you because they will ask like if you are a tech lead how will you manage your team type questions or they will ask you how how you handle your task what you feel uh which one is good so guys please answer that logically not emotionally emotions doesn't come in corporate world so Keep your emotion aside and think logically and answer that psychometric test which is basically not an elimination round but you should give best for them okay and the next which is the most important part is game based app guys if you ever think of that key you have done all the four section above good and apt means game a you didn't perform well then guys just forgot about the cap jamy because you have to perform good in game based app and try to touch if you are not even um move to the more big levels like 10 to 15 levels you haven't crossed then try that in each and every section you have performed at least 10 levels okay so the there will be motion challenge digit challenge switch challenge greet challenge and deductive and inductive reasoning challenge okay so I will give you example in short so that you can prepare okay and if you clear all these sections in the first round online test then you will get the coding round which is for the higher rule that is 7.5 package so I hope guys you cleared well the first round so that you will get eligible for the coding round because 7.5 is a good package guys so please be prepared so there will be these type of rounds uh you can see deductive challenge is like the pseudo code switch challenge is basically you have to switch and which switch these objects and what the number you get after switching this type of and grid challenge guys it is the most most most dana challenge you can ever face because in this they will there will be you face at the same time two faces means the first in which you have to remember one dot after that they will show one question you have to that do that question as soon as possible after that one more uh dot will be appear you have to remember all the position of dot and in between there will be one question so you have to do that question and remember the previously asked dot okay so this is the most most most important and the most gya challenge you have ever met okay after that inductive challenge you have to just see the pattern what is this pattern and you have to then select the same pattern in uh the left side given grid okay and the motion challenge this is basically guys you have always been in your childhood played this game in which you have to put uh this red ball into the hole after many obstacles so so giving an overview how can you um do that okay so the first challenge yeah the first challenge uh we will see is switch challenge so what is switch challenge there will be your uh different types of uh symbols and you have to switch this and which number it appear you have to tick on that so first of all what you have to do whatever is the top of means top uh every top uh symbols you have to put as 1 2 3 4 so our rectangle will be one your triangle will be two plus will be three and circle will be four now uh you have to see how this be rearranged so here the third symbol is at first so you will write three three here okay now you can see the second symbol is at second so you will write two then you will see then you will see your uh fourth symbol is at third so you will write four here here four and uh you can see the first symbol is at fourth so you will write first so what you have to means do on the basis of whatever you have written the numbering of this symbol into this so so the the answer will be three three then two then four then 1 okay 3 2 4 and 1 okay so here you can see you have to assign 1 2 3 4 and uh if you switch three is here um 2 is here four is here and 1 is here so what will be the answer 3 2 4 1 you can take an screenshot so that you can think and uh answer it by yourself okay or you can go to the prep stuff for that okay in this Okay yeah yeah in this challenge what you have to do is you have to just play as a sudoko types okay so this is deductive u logical thinking in this uh whatever will be the symbol here will not be in this row and the same column there will be a unique symbol so that it cannot collide in the same column and the same row means the whole row have the unique symbol and the whole column should be of unique uh symbol okay like this the problem statement is given this one this one this one and here will be the question mark and whole row will be blank but you have to solve means one of the blank if you solve you can get that which symbol should I write so that it couldn't collide on the same row and the same column so you have to practice some of them so that you get to know which symbol should be there okay so uh here you can I can give you one overview like because you can see all the symbols are there except the circle symbol okay so triangle is there plus is there rectangle is there but except circle these all row are filled so you will fill here circle so now uh in this column you will means in this row you will see a rectangle is there triangle is there now circle is also I have put so what will be plus symbol so we will write plus here so you can see okay so you have to fill one column and you can see the pattern which column should be there and this type of question so you have to practice this guys because uh in that time in 6 minute you have to do as much as level you can do there is no limit of the labels if you can solve 100 levels even in six minutes then you will get 101 level also so it is infinite labels just you have to be um more fast in your thinking so that you can cross the labels okay the label will be increases like in the first you will find uh four columns and four rows then you will find five columns five columns and five rows so guys the they will increase level one by one so please be prepared uh take your copy pen and practice as much as you can this is the most important part of app based means game based question and the digit challenge is basically guys you have also solved in your college or school times in which they will provide the um answer or write one of the questions and you have to on the basis of your thinking of multiplication division and uh subtraction what you will be there the digit so that we return 20 so it can be anything like uh 2 into 2 will be four + 16 we can do then we will get 20 so uh anything will be there four four and four four are 16 + 4 then we will get 20 so anything will be there just you have to be a good calculation master okay so anything will be there like 2 into 9 + 2 20 7 into 2 + 6 20 similarly here uh you have to write something so that uh they could divide and then multiply so that they will give six okay so here can be 9 by 6 9 by 6 uh into four so you will get six okay and this is the motion challenge guys this is basically you have played in your bud pun very much okay so in this uh you will find a hole in which you have to put this red mark however you can do you will you will think of the most most uh less uh steps you can do to put this red ball into that hole so that uh you will get more marks okay uh the less the steps the more will be your marks okay so you can take um Yeah you can see here how will you approach this question so the first thing what he did is first he uh he took the blue one up and then the the red ball here is the red ball and what he can do is after that blue one is up so there will be one step after that uh that purple is at here so two steps after that the third step in which uh he did is uh take this um red red ball in the in this position then there will be three step after that uh you can take this ball and put into the hole that is four step and guys one more thing wherever you stop your ball then they will count that step so please if you want to take this red ball uh at the last uh last grid then just put uh select the the red ball and uh directly put it here otherwise wherever you left it they will count a step okay so mind that and uh yeah guys here one more step we live that uh the green one they did up and then here okay so the green wall was here so 1 2 3 4 5 6 there will be six step totals and this is the most important part guys grid challenge in grid challenge what you can see let's check so there will be dot appear in your section okay so you have to remember these dots like the first you have remember one and then you will face one question and then again you will face one dot so you have to remember every dot and you have to remember dot according to the numbering like the first dot where there appear you have to write that first okay so you in that you can do is take your marker and write on the screen because yeah it's very much frustrating you can't remember every dot u position so you can do is uh you can uh use a highlighter uh write it mark and when you complete all the sections then you can remove and then move to the next means uh there will be they will increase uh to remembering the dot the first they will give the two dots to remember after that they will give the five dots to remember after that they will get seven dots to remember and every dot guys first they will show a dot then they will show a question you have to see the whether it is symmetrical or asymmetrical or not or anything like that they will also give you the add type questions so you have to uh just do the questioning within a second and then you have to remember the dot also so you can use the marker on your screen so that you can remember the dots okay so they will see the you have to yeah so here is the explanation first uh you will see on the screen like these dots and they will color one dot you have to remember this is the first dot after that they will question uh question you is it symmetrical so you have to see that this one and this one looks like same or not so here you can see there is three there is two there is three there is three but you can see there is there should be three so that it could be symmetrical but no it is not symmetrical so you will click no after that they will again give you one dot to remember so the first dot was here and the second dot they give here and again they will ask about one question it will be any question guys mainly there will be a symmetrical question or add questions type means they will give some symbol and if you add these two those symbols what we will get the next symbol like that okay there will be one arrow types question like this to add the arrows and what you get as a symbol okay so here also there will be symmetrical one so three you can see here three you can see here three you can see three you can see here two 2 and everything is symmetrical so you will click yes and mark the dot position in the correct order okay so the first dot was here and the second dot was here with each level up the number of dots are and the symmetric increases okay so this time they have given two two dots the next time they will give four dots then next time they will give five dots guys I think they have written the wrong answer it is not symmetrical it is symmetrical so you just don't believe this this is not symmetrical at all you can see and also you can go through it it is not symmetrical guys this is symmetrical okay so you have to mind it uh it's just the explanation guys what you can do and what you have to do okay and this is the same rule question means it's what is it is called uh yeah inductive challenge inductive challenge in which they will provide you two grid in in the right side on the basis of these two grid patterns you have to take two more grids in here which two grids follow the same pattern as the right two grids okay so this grid you can see plus sign is above in the first row and the third row in the same is following the same this row grid the first row contain plus symbol and the last row contain the plus symbol so you will see in this which two grids follow the same rule so this also the plus containing the first row and the third row in this also first row and the third row so the second and third one will be the same rule following the grid okay so you have to click these two this uh there will be also um you can uh they will increase the level guys it is easy like you can see and answer that they are following these type of rules first and third row as the plus but they will increase uh the patterns and you have to look the patterns very much okay so that you can't uh can't get confused so you have to uh think about that which row is having the same formula and all so you can you can pick any things which is like give you the sign that they might be same it's not like that key you have to face the same symbol like here it is written the plus+ so you are finding only plus+ if there will be um there will be rectangle rectangle first and third row then might it may be following the same rule because they are not saying that the they are following the same symbol rule they are following the same rules so it can be different symbol but following the same rule okay like this in this question you have to do by yourself find it out which pattern two grids are following the same rule as these two rules and please guys don't skip do it by yourself because there you have to do by your okay after that uh they you will not contain this type yeah that's it these are the section you will face guys please practice as much as you can you can go for brain games for that uh means you can download it from the play store brain games where you get all the games practice as much as you can if you cleared this round then there will be high chances guys you will get one of the offer if you will perform the interview well but the first round is the crucial round otherwise all other rounds are so easy guys that you can crack if you are a good student or an average student okay all the best guys and do like and subscribe bye-bye if ever any doubt then do comments in the comment section

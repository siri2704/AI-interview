[Music] hello friends welcome back to our channel so today we will discuss about the introduction to rdbms and the basic terminologies in rdbms so this rdbms stands for relational database management system relational dbms and the name itself indicates it will deal with the relations all the relations so here the relations means the data is represented data will be represented in terms of rows in rows right so the data here the rate will be represented in terms of rows and that we call it as a relations right so organizing the data in tables will be very easy to access the data right if any sort of the data is organized in the form of tables then automatically it will be very easy for accessing that particular data so that's why so this is a relational database and a modern softwares will be using related to this relational database management system that is a relational dbms rdbus now we will see the basic terminologies of this rdbms so the first one is a relation so what is meant by this relation in rdbms so this relation means table table is also known as a relation in rdbms for example consider the student database so student table so student id student name percentage percentage so this is the a table this is called a table or a relation it's called a relation for example student number is 101 and the student name is some sandi and the percentage is some 95 and the student number is one or two and name is samsara and some percentage is 94 and 103 the student name is some deepak and the percentage is some 90 right so this is the student table this is a student table and this we call it as a relation in rdm or dbms so here you can see we are giving the student details all the student details are being organized in a tabular format so that's why we call it as a relation right so relation means a table which consists of rows and columns and data and the second terminology is tuples or records records so the individual row is known as a tuple so if you observe so this is one tuple and this is another triple and this is an another tuple or we can also call as a records so for example you can see here so this particular row consists of the details of a student sunday the second row consists of the details of a student sarah third row consists of the student details related to a deeper right so that means we are having three rows we are having some three student details right each row is known as a tuple or a record so here we we need to remember a few things that is in tuple there should be no duplicate values no duplicate tuples right that means identical tuples should not be included in the relation for example we are having a fourth row one not one and sandeep and 95 so if you observe here the fourth row the fourth row is having the unique elements of the first row so one not one ninety five one hour comes only 95 so this should not be accepted that means no duplicate tools should be available right and so all the tuples should follow same format same format that means the first one student id student name and percentage so the same format should be followed for all the students right and the next terminology so these are called as a tuples right these are called as a tuples and i am removing this one so no duplicate should be allowed in tuples right now next one attributes attributes and these attributes are known as the columns okay the columns so this is an attribute and this is an attribute this is an attribute so attributes are for the tuples so you can observe that user first attribute should have a name attribute should have a name to identify to name should have a name to identify so here student id is an attribute student name is an attribute percentage is an attribute so here i am writing student name is an attribute sorry student id the first one is id then student name is one more attribute percentage is one more item so every attribute should have a name to identify right and also there will be a unique attribute unique attribute known as a primary key primary key to identify the tuples okay to identify the tuple there should be a unique attribute called as a primary key right for example if you take student name so sandi so in a class there can be multiple students with the same name so it should not be considered as a primary key coming to the percentage so more than one student can get a equal percentage so for example 94 so 94 is a percentage which can be get for multiple students right so there might be a chance so that should not be considered as a percentage so coming to the student id so student id will be the unit right so no two students will share the same student id so such attribute we call it as a unique attribute and that is we call it as a primary key to identify the complete triple right and the next one data item so data item means the actual data so this is also called as cell data cell data so you can see this is one cell another cell another cell so these points we call it as a cells these blocks we call it as a cells so a cell is an intersection of a tuple and attribute okay a cell is an intersection intersection of a tuple and attribute so simply we can say it has intersection of row and column so if you observe this one it is an intersection of tuple and column right so horizontally horizontal row right and a vertical column so this will be represented as tuple and attribute intersection and these data must be okay this data must be atomic atomic means it should have a single value the data cell or data item should have a single value right for example student id so one not one comma one or two this is not a valid so it should have only one value so one not one so student name suddenly comma abc so it is not a valid because it should have only one value so the data the cell data or a data item should have a single value a single value right so relation triples attributes data item the next one the next terminology is a cardinality cardinality so here the cardinality means a number of tuples gives the cardinality so in this example how many tuples are there one two and three so the cardinality of a student table cardinality of student table is 3 because we are having the 3 tuples 3 rows so number of tuples or number of rows gives the cardinality okay the next one degree so degree means number of attributes number of attributes gives the degree so this is nothing but cardinality and this is nothing but degree right cardinality 3 a degree 3 because number of attributes for the student table is in 3 so degree of student table three because student id student name in a person is three attributes are there that means the three columns right so the degree of a student table will be three cardinality it's a number of tuples or number of rows or number of records the next one is domain so domain means all the possible values given for an attribute so attribute is a column so we need we are supposed to give a value for the attribute right so the what are the possible values that should be given for an attribute is called a domain in this example consider this percentage so percentage will be 0 to 100 in between 0 and 100 right so that is called a domain so here the domain for a percentage is 0 to 100 so this is called a domain right the possible values given for the attribute and the last one it say null values now values so coming to this null values if a cell kept blank during a data insertion then that particular cell will be given as a null values cell or attribute whatever it may be for example the student id 101 sandeep and if you are not i am not giving this percentage right i just kept blank then it will be filled with a null value so this is not equal to not equal to 0 right so null the null means that doesn't it implies that the percentage is 0 right so that percentage cell has been left blank right so we can fill that percentage in future so at present that cell has been kept left okay so and null value means if any cell or an attribute kept blank during the data insertion that blank will be represented with a null that blank will be represented within null and this is not equal to 0 or a space or any space right it's not equal to 0 or any space so this is the null values so i hope you understood the basic terminologies of our dbms so this is called a relation the table is called as a relation and the rows are called as a tuples or records and the columns we call it as a attributes and each attribute we have we should have the name and unique attribute should be represented with a primary key in order to represent the complete tuple and the number of tuples we call it as a cardinality the number of columns we call it as a degree and domain the possible values given for an attribute is called the mind and null values if the cell is kept blank during the data and session that particular cell will be filled with the null values and it should it doesn't mean it equal to zero or a space right so this is this is the basic introduction to rdbms and the basic terminologies used in the relational database management system right so hope you understood this one and if you are having any doubts regarding this one feel free to post your doubts in the comment section definitely i will try to clarify all your doubts

good morning and good evening friends welcome to go online.com this is Bhaskar Joi we are going to be starting demo number three of three today is the final demo to watch tomorrow I'm going to be showing you how to install SQL Server and PowerBI in your laptop i have also given you in yesterday's class uh the configuration about your laptop okay just watch demo number one demo number two videos which are available in YouTube channel called go online trainings you need to subscribe the channel and uh try to watch those videos if not you will be able to you know ask me so that I will be able to send those videos i have given you one WhatsApp you know uh link everybody has to join so that daily recorded videos and other communication you will be able to get it okay so to become a data analyst I need just 100 days of yours daily 2 hours of practice is needed 100 days means three months you can complete this course and if you keep a minimum of three years you will be able to get minimum 15 to 20 lakhs in India right freshers 2022 2023 passed out guys uh one guy got as a fresher job uh in the month of I think October November uh as a fresher 2022 passed out in Aabad the company has given nine lakhs for the fresher now you see mechanical guy 2022 passed out couldn't get campus placement and after one year he came back to me has learned this course as a fresher he got job in Ahmedabad his name is Shubhham I have recorded his success story in my YouTube channel just watch Shubhham from Vishaka Patnham got nine lakhs package in data analytics so that is what I wanted to show you we do not teach courses way build skills okay guys and you become a data analyst in 100 days completely zero to her i am assuming that you don't know anything about IT industry first time you're learning IT courses I am I am making sure that everything I'm going to be teaching from a very very basic level very very basic level you need not know anything about data analytics what is the prerequisite if you know 2 + 2= d4 you can become a data analyst that's it if you know 2 + 3 equals do4 that means you're ready you can easily get into data analytics clear but only thing is that you need to have a goal to go into IT industry if that goal is not there then nobody can help you because I can train you end of the day I you know nobody can train you you need to train yourself right we can teach you we can give you the material and daily minimum two hours of practice is needed Monday to Friday we'll have classes Saturday Sunday we don't have any classes till end of the course remember this and other holidays also we don't conduct any classes monday to Friday daily 1 hour you need to you know attend the class if you're not able to attend get the video and practice that so time is not a problem for you and you know nothing is problem for you i'm there i have given my number also anytime you will be able to you know uh call me and ask me if you have any doubts as well so this course is suitable for career break people transition if you wanted to have from nonIT to IT any age any anyone wanted to get into IT at any age 35 38 40 50 47 any any age migrate from other technologies within IT sector I am from net background Java background or I am from C++ background or SAP background mainframe background or I am from Python background easily you will be able to migrate Because more than Java developer your salary will be more more than net developer your salary will be more data oriented technologies are going to give you more salaries than Java developers more salaries than SAP developers more salaries than your Python developers you ask anybody you take 10 years guy of Python developer 10 years guy of data analy data analyst so definitely data analyst will be getting more much more salaries right people who took the training in 2012 2014 under me now they're cracking they are having the salaries in Hyderabad itself up to 48 lakhs to 65 lakhs in abroad somebody already there they're earning more than a 2 cr peranom so that is the 10 years of you know grow you know worth when you learn this kind of a technologies right but only thing is that if you Don't approach you know proper people uh they will give you the bad uh you know what do you say suggestions never never ask for course which course I should do that is the wrong question you should ask you should always ask which mentor I should follow so that I will be able to get into IT sector I want to become a good doctor what you should ask you know which doctor you under him I should you know do the uh internship so that I can become a best lawyer or Best doctor like that you need to ask not the courses courses everybody will do if you study in YouTube also you'll have a lot of 300 rupees courses it is not the course alone it is completed depends upon the mentor that you choose clear guys so so all these things been discussed already now I want you to connect and complete the demo guys and tomorrow I'm going to be installing the power and everything guys And uh today will be the final demo and after this demo I have given you the 15% discount that is also you can make and you know send the screenshot to uh my office number so that you will be able to get the new meeting ID for the tomorrow's class okay so I have given you all this number this is my direct number this is my office number so today till 10 p.m ist the discount is available for this course you can just make the payment and send the screenshot to this number guys now for today let us talk about why business intelligence or what is a business intelligence architecture or what is a data analytics architecture i'm going to be discussing to do to you just watch it right so you think that company called Amazon is there amazon company is there so they have large amount of data worldwide why because Amazon company is doing business uh all over the world so I'm going to be taking use case from Amazon company they have data so I wanted to analyze their data i'm the data analyst i said you give me the data hey Amazon you give me the data i wanted to analyze your data so when I go and approach Amazon company Amazon company is saying hey Basar we know that you're a reputed data analyst so definitely we will give you our data you can analyze your my data but the problem is that I my data is not available in single location so they have lot of issues data issues or we can say data challenges they have what is the biggest challenge they're telling me bhaskar we have the business all over the world the first issue is that location i don't have the data amazon company telling me we don't have the data in single location some of the data in India some of the data in US some of the data in UK Dubai like that all over all over the world we have the business the data is also stored in their countries only we are not going to be centrally storing all the you know data the first issue is called decentralization of the data the company is one company but the business is happening everywhere so local data they are storing in the local countries only that is the first issue what is the issue you can say different locations means different locations means what decentralization of the data company is one data is not centralized that is the first issue you have to understand clear company is one but data is not available in a single place decentralization is the biggest issue clear guys the second issue they're telling me hey Bhaskar we have a different software applications in India it is a Java when you go to amazon.in when you go to amazon.in in to buy a laptop i told you yesterday to buy laptop right so if you wanted to buy a laptop what I told you yesterday you don't spend much more amount 35,000 rupees is enough celeradon laptops don't buy it cheaper and don't buy this kind of a laptop 35,000 rupees to 40,000 rupees you can get good laptops so 37,000 this laptop you can buy so this configuration is 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD Intel hard disk and Windows 11 so this one you can buy it so you can use this laptop don't waste your money for your uh you know costly laptops right so if you make the amount all the data is going to go to where this website do you know how this is made it may be a Java application it made by using a net we do not know right so when you go to Amazon India application is a Java if you go to US the application may be net if you go to UK and purchase some products maybe that application you may be using Android or it may be Python we do not know or sometimes when you call a call center they're using Excel or they may using some CRM applications we do not know or they may be using SAP application or some of the data is stored in the CSV files mean flat files text files how they are storing the data we do not know am I clear different applications the company is using and people are logging into that application they're buying I I can also use Android application instead of going to uh Amazon.com I will be able to buy a product what is a product i'm buying Python you know the laptop for my course am I clear so what is the important point here so the data is not centralized it is completely decentralized that is one issue second issue to get the data you have to go to different apps and get the data remember this say company will not give me data in a silver platter they don't give me the data in a common place they'll say hey I have data here I have data there i have data there i will give you read permission you you go and get the data okay because I'm a technical person i should be able to go and talk to SAP talk to this one talk to that one get the data that kind of a knowledge I should be able to have it now PowerBI can connect with hundreds of sources and get the data powerbi can connect to anything and get the data 100 plus sources are available in PowerBI anybody can easily get the data like that you need to understand now this is the second issue the third issue what is the size of the data size may be small size maybe medium GBs of size or maybe large large means pabyte terabyte yabyte of data so you cannot plan if it is a small size data small hardware is enough but when you have a large amount of data you need to have enough hardware enough computation powers enough networking lot of things you need to plan right because we are not talking about small company here we're talking about Amazon company clear so remember this company's data right now uh the next issue is that all of them are the data issues with the data it may be any company the next company with accuracy of the data accuracy means what how clean the data is it may be low-level accuracy or maybe having medium level accuracy or me having high level accuracy how accuracy means how clean the data is clear so if somebody gives you fruits do you think that the fruits are very cleaned fruits my father is sending me a lot of grapes in Hyderabad now it is a grapes season right is cutting the grapes and sending it to me in a bus from my village do you think that the grapes are very very clean because my father is sending need not be i need to clean them right amazon giving you data it does not mean that it is a cleaned data no no no no they have a lot of issues with their data what is the first issue they may have duplicated data they may have misspelled data they may have a blank data they may have wrong values in some Excel sheets that you cannot identify right so if somebody gives you anything do you think that you believe them blindly you are not going to believe you have to clean those vegetables or the fruits before eating them so this is what is called cleaning cleaning work of the data has to be done technically this cleaning or you're going to be changing the data based on the requirements so this is what is called transforming your data clear so transformation means cleaning transformation means what cleaning you're going to be cleaning the data so if somebody gives you fruits will you be eating or will you be cleaning first you're going to be cleaning the fruits even though your mother has given you some fruits what do you do immediately you go you wash the fruits and try to eat them so somebody gives you data it is not ready to use data even though they say ready to use you are going to be still checking whether this data is cleaned or not why if the data is not so cleaned whatever will be going into the database if that is wrong comes out will be wrong so when you say if you're thinking negatively can you act positively you cannot right because thinking is negative 24 by7 you are thinking negatively you cannot be you can become a positive person so think think positively so that you will become a positive person so whatever goes in is wrong comes out will be wrong so if you put wrong data you cannot get a right data from somewhere so at the time of putting the data you have to ensure that the data is cleaned data clear so accuracy is very very important because if you don't store correct data in your applications tomorrow your AI and BI applications will fail am I clear like that we have lot lots of problems concurrency this one that one so you have a lot of issues with the data but what I should do even though all these are available now we should be able to take the data from decentralized places and different environments different size and we are going to be cleaning the data and storing the data for that purpose I'm going to be using a one more technology so here I'm going to be talking about BI architecture business intelligence or data analytics architecture i'm going to be talking about now so this is the data I'm going to be having in different different sources all the data belong to which company all the data belong to I'm talking about Amazon company amazon company's data some of the data may be in India it may be in Java application or some of the data maybe is in US maybe this net application clear like that I have some data in Dubai Dubai they have a call center the people are storing the data into the excel sheets they have some sales data that is in CRM application it may be uh getting from let us say uh some other country called UK so like that we do not know what kind of a applications they have it so what you need to do you need to get their data from here get their data from here and all the data you have to bring it this data belong to single company you can get the data combine the data you means your data analyst is going to be getting the data step number one so for for that you need to have one software application called ETL yesterday I was talking about one application called SSIS so what is this application which is a ETL application what it is going to be doing so yesterday clearly I spoken about this application do you remember so where is that we have spoken yesterday so MSBA has three tools and SSIS is MSBA application and this is launched in year 2005 by Microsoft and lot of things I have told you in yesterday right so three tools it has SSIS and SSAS and SSRS this is a reporting tool SSRS is gone today and in the SSRS place we have a powerba powerbi is a reporting tool earlier SSRS by Microsoft powerbi is launched in 2015 msbi is launched in long back 20 years back so what I told you you have to use that SSIS application and with the SSIS application which is ETL application so ETL stands for extracting the data extract it can talk to Java,Net Excel UK it can talk to extract the data it canract extract means reading the data transform the data means clean the data then it can also load the data transformation means what cleaning clear so ETL operations can be done with the help of SSIS ssis is going to be going and getting the data so in a layman terminology SSIS is completely a transport service lorry service you are you you remember you have a lot of mango mangoes in India mangoes in US or grapes you have some grapes here like that you have orange fruits so how do you get all the fruits if you want to make orange juice so or grape juice getting different fruits and dumping into a transport transport may be a lorry so it may be all grapes or all oranges and grapes or you know goa different different fruits you have to get it you are making a lot of juices in the factory what you do step number one collect all the Goa from different farmers collect all the grapes from different farmers collect all the oranges from different different farmers you have to bring to your factory you are going to be centralizing clear you're going to be getting from Vishwagatam Visag from you know Maharashtra all the places wherever mangoes are there you send a lorry and get it so SSIS is a transport service or lorry service am I clear get the data 10 cents of mangoes and grapes you are going to be you know you're getting and dumping into a bigger godown in your factory clear what your factory is going to make it is going to be making a juices out of that clear however you have a raw fruits the same way you have a raw data all the data you can combine because it is Amazon company data only okay so for that I'm going to be using what ETL what is ETL it is a lorry service a transport service it can dump the data if you want to clean the data you can also clean otherwise simply get the data load the data cleaning work we can do it later okay liwala will go get all the fruits first right so after that what is going to be making all the fruits is going to be dumping into one bigger go down voice is not so clear deepak is saying voice is not so clear what about others guys am I clear what about others voice say yes or no am I clear or not clear clear okay guys please Deepak so you have to Pan and Deepak can you just you know uh disconnect and connect once again connect and connect and disconnect because I'm using 200 MB speed of internet it may be problem at your end okay just disconnect and connect once again okay so all the data I'm going to be dumping here where I'm going to be dumping into one more place this place is called staging area staging means what temporary staging server staging means what temporary server all the fruits you're going to be getting and temporarily you're going to be dumping into one bigger go down so staging means a computer server means a computer all the raw data is going to be coming here so here you are going to be doing data cleansing work remember this staging means temporary staging means what temporary you are going to be you are going to be doing what is called as a data cleaning so all the fruits you're going to be getting the fruits from here you're going to be getting the fruits from here all the fruits you're going to be dumping into the bigger go down a bigger data warehouse will be there or bigger area will be there in your factory so in that all the fruits are going to be dumped after that what you do you call the labor and labor is going to be putting the water and cutting the fruits if it is not so good half of the fruit they are going to be cutting and throw it away so we are going to be cleaning all the fruits clear so the staging area is going to be used for the cleaning purpose so what kind of a cleaning I do i do if we have a duplicate data remove dupes data or correct misspelled data i have misspelled data if you have any misspelled data that I have to correct it and I'm going to be merging splitting some data or converting some data all these operations I'm going to be doing as part of a data cleansing activity so data cleansing is very very important activity that it is going to be happening on the raw data raw fruits what you do you're going to be cleaning the fruits right after you go to shop number one this is shop number one buy some vegetables you go to shop number two buy some more vegetables this is shop number three buy some more vegetables all the raw vegetables what your mother is going to be doing all the vegetables she's going to be dumping everything into a staging area what is it what is called your carry bag carry bag is going to be uh your temporary area all the vegetables are going to be dumping you go to supermarket what you do you go to 10 vegetable shops and fruit shops you're going to be buying lot of vegetables and dumping into where in your carry bag carry bag is a staging temporary area after coming home what you do you're going to be opening the bag and trying to clean all the vegetables and the fruits right so staging area means carry bag so carry bag you're going to be using and carry bag is a temporary you're not going to be using permanently all the vegetables righting area temporary once everything is cleaned area will be completely empty your carry bag will be empty right so you get the vegetables you clean the vegetables manually and the clean vegetables what you do you transform right for example potato you bought it potato what all you do potato you bring them after that you clean them you put them lot of water and clean them and you peel them clean them peel them then what you do you are going to be cutting the potato into small small pieces and after that what you do you put some turmeric you put some salt and keep it in the fridge why you are going to be making lot of uh potato dish after 1 hour so what you're going to be doing you're going to be getting the vegetables and after that cleaning the vegetable cleaning is not sufficient peeling the vegetable after that you do cutting the vegetable after that putting the salt putting the some more water and putting the pepper and everything and put the uh the potato into refrigerator so all of them are what transformation potato is not a potato now it is you know you cut the potato now right or you have taken a tomato what mother would have told you get the tomato then clean the tomato then peel the tomato then you have to let us say grind the raw tomato now tomato is transformed to a liquid form so data you're going to be getting you're not going to be storing as it is you may convert you may convert depends upon the requirement for example In America people will be paying the product price in USD in India people are going to be making the product price in INR so if the company wanted to know what is my profit in India what is my profit in USD the Amazon company owner belong to USD they don't understand in INR currency what they say they they'll say convert all Indian rupees into USD and tell me the profit so now you have to convert right they're telling me Basa don't show me the profit in INR or Indian rupees convert everything into ISD as per today's standards and show it to me so that is the conversion we talking about so you don't use a tomato as a tomato only you're going to be cutting the tomato putting as it is or making a a liquid out of the tomato and you're going to be using as a sauce right so the data will not be used as it is the vegetables are not going to be used as it is it is going to be converted converted into different different shapes clear that is what is called a transform transformation and cleaning and changing so you need to clean the tomato transformation number one and grinding the tomato that is a transformation transformation number two and put salt into the tomato transformation number three put pepper also into potato transformation number four so how many transformations are applied on the potato or the tomato four transformations four changes clear so on the data you can apply multiple transformations changing clear so you're going to be getting the data from different different places step number one you are going to be storing into uh this area you're going to be what you do here you're going to be cleaning the data and changing the data where in the staging area staging means temporary okay so all these things are going to be happening by you after that what you do you take this uh vegetables okay you take this data all the data from this you are going to be now dumping into uh final place because you have cleaned all the potato all the tomato so what you do cleaned potato you're going to be keeping in the refrigerator for that here I'm going to be using one more uh ETL again the cleaned potato everything you need to take it from here from this place you are going to be again using one more transport service now it is a raw potato now it is a raw potato here this is a raw so raw as it is we're going to be dumping This is also will be containing a raw so here all the raw potato you're going to be cleaning so this will be cleaned potato this is a raw potato you'll have different different things raw potato will be cleaned the cleaned potato you're going to be taking again dumping into final one more factory clear if you have one more factory what you do you're going to be taking the cleaned potato and dumping for that you may use different different uh transport so the final potato manually I'm going to be putting in my refrigerator okay so you think you're running your own business or running your own factory what you do you're going to be having all the potatoes you will get raw potato you will get it here you clean them so cleaned potato what you do you are going to be using a belt in the uh you know factories all the bells are going to be taken the cleaned potato dumping into a tank number one and tank number two from the tank number two it is going to go to tank number three and tank number four it will come out so one by one one by one you're going to be dumping right think like that so raw potato raw banana or whatever you would like to have all the things are going to be dumped into staging area staging area is same as your data source whatever the fruits available here the same data will come so staging area will have a raw data as it is no cleaned data so your carry bag is going to be having what whatever the vegetable shop is having the same potato you're going to be buying and putting into your bag so your carry bag will have same potato there's no change there after that you clean them from here to here if you want to dump it you're going to be putting raw data now it will become cleaned data cleaned potato you're going to be keeping where in your refrigerator your refrigerator will be data warehouse now clear in the companies you maintain one more big basket called data warehouse what is a data warehouse this is also one more bigger computer i told you that is a large hardware where SQL is installed i told you in day one and day two if you did not watch that videos means watch what is data warehousing bigger computer server means a computer bigger computer it is not your laptop laptop is not a bigger computer right laptop will have 1 TB of hard disk bigger computer will have 100 terabyte of hard disk clear so you're having 4 GB of RAM that computer will have 500 GB of RAM very big computer inside that SQL is installed ysql as we discussed SQL is used to store data clear large amount of data if you wanted to store we can use SQL but large hardware is supported so that it can use large amount of data physically you can store so every day what will happen you're getting the raw data with the lries and everything all the data is going to be dumped into staging area and after dumping the data into the staging area cleaning process will happen in the staging area staging means temporary after that staging area all the cleaned potato tomato everything will be going into the final cold rooms or the refrigerator so data warehousing is your refrigerator you can think like that so all the raw vegetables will come like that you need to understand this platform i can give you simple example so that you can understand so I don't have a water supply at my home so morning 6:00 water comes water tanker comes to my street government of India will send water tanks to all the people who do not have water supply morning 6:00 water tanker comes to my street what I do me my father my mother my sister everybody will carry buckets and go collect the water so all all people what are we going to do this is me i'm taking a plastic bucket my father will be taking a silver bucket different buckets my sister is taking one more bucket these are called buckets clear so initial water I'm going to be collecting in this buckets after that what we do we have a bigger tank or the drum this is a tank you think like that so this is me i'll go with the bucket i will you know uh go to the tanker i switch on the tap of the tank the tanker the water is full in this bucket so immediately I'm going going to come here i'll be putting a water into here like that my father my everybody will be going and dumping the water directly here so that is what we're going to be doing right so what is the size of the bucket it is maybe 30 liter 40 lit capacity what is the tank capacity let it say 1,000 lit capacity clear but you may be asking why you you you take a tank and go to the street can you take a tank and go it will be difficult for to carry right so normally if you want to collect the water fresh water you don't carry bigger bigger tanks and go to the street what you do you take 30 40 liters of cans and buckets you are going to be collecting initial water there so that is what is called fresh water fresh water you will be able to connect it and once the buckets are full that you're going to be getting and dumping into your tank so tank is going to be having yesterday's water today's the water and last week water also every day you're going to be doing the circus morning 6:00 you get up take the bucket because you don't have the water supply in your uh apartment or in your house you do not have the source so what you do you're dependent on somebody else so that is the thing you need to understand but one day your brother told or friend told hey why are you manually getting the water and putting into the tank can't you buy a motor pump okay so manually you're going and lifting the water and putting the water can't you buy a motor pump your friend has given one idea so you went and you wanted to buy one motor pump okay when you buy a motor pump you are able to get lot of motor pumps like this now you tell me what is this motor pump it is nothing but it can connect your bucket right and all the water it can dump into a tank so what is this it is it is what is called as ETL remember what is ETL etl can go to anywhere right it can go to bucket it can go to well it can go to sea water just give the connection switch on the motor it can get the water from anywhere it can dump the water what is ETL etl means a motor pump it is going to be extracting the data and dumping the data into the destination that's it etl means software what software control Ctrl + V copying the data pasting the data that's it etl means extracting the data transformation means cleaning it won't clean anything it won't clean anything so you may be applying some kind of a filter so that if you have any dust and everything that will small small filtering you can apply right in the motor what normally we do we put some filters so so that bad if you have any small small particles that will get filtered small kind of a small cleaning work will start not complete cleaning work in the motor so you extract the raw water with the help of a ETL some so you may use any company's ETL Right you may buy you may buy any company's ETL that means what so SSIS is from Microsoft ssis is from Microsoft this is a CRA motor pump this is a SPL different companies will have you have uh ODI is there oracle data integrator it is Oracle companies this is a Microsoft company this company belong to Laxmi company so lot of companies ETLs are available you can choose one ETL what is ETL means etl means you need to understand a pump so that pump you have bought it now it is going to be dumping taking the water from here and dumping all the water directly into the tank but one day your mother told hey we cannot dump all the water directly here you buy one more tank this is a tank number one this is a tank number two you initially don't put like this you put the water here you clean the water cleaned water using second pump this is motor pump number one this is motor pump number two cleaned water will be going here using motor pump number two so like that you need to dump pump number one will put the water you're going to be cleaning the water so cleaned water we're going to be cleaning so cleaned water you may be putting into one more drum here so this will be a raw data this will be cleaned data this cleaned data this guy is going to be taking and putting into here right so like that you have to have pump number one and pump number two so this is what you got to understand if uh uh Telangana government or you know the India government wanted to supply a water what they do they get a water from Ganga Yamuna right all the Godavari all the water will be taken by bigger bigger pump Kaleshwaram project you have right all the pumps are going to be taking the water and putting into a bigger reservoir here cleaning work is going to be happening after that the with the help of one more pump all the water will be sented to Hyderabad AD this is Hyderabad tank you can send it to let us say Pune plant Pune city like that bigger bigger you know cities will have bigger bigger tanks the all the water from the rivers are going to go to one place and cleaned cleaned water will be again supplied to different cities clear you need to understand like that okay so if you're able to understand ETL means data pumping software data importing exporting software in your in your body there is a ETL what is your ETL tell me your heart heart will be pumping the blood from one place to another place in your body there is a staging staging means cleaning area kidney kidney will be staging so it is going to be cleaned your blood and the cleaned blood will be pumped using a heart heart is atl your kidney is your staging staging means cleaning process is going to be happening am I clear so you are going to understand like that now what I'm trying to do I'm trying to give you two new things here one is called OLTP data online transaction data oltp means what online transaction processing this is one new thing I wanted to give you okay the second one second one I wanted to give you is OLAP okay oltp one thing I want to give you second one online transaction processing online analytical processing clear so the first one in my example so this is this is what is called as OLP this is what is called as OLAP so you have two type of applications two things that you need to understand in a business every business will have OLTP applications and OLAP applications what is OLTP oltp means online transaction processing transaction means what in Telugu transaction means lava dvi whatever you do in the business does a transaction for example you go to hotel you pay a bill that is a transaction you come to go online trainings you inquire about a course that is a transaction you go to hotel take a hotel room that is a transaction you go to a uh restaurant you eat something and pay the bill that is a transaction you go to banking you withdraw the cash that is a transaction so whatever you do in the real world everything is a transaction transferring funds cancelling the room booking inquiring about the courses or whatever you do data is attached to that clear but all the data is going to be captured in the business in a OLTP machines for example you go to banking so you want to withdraw the cash or you would like to deposit the cash so the banking software is nothing but a OLTP software only oltp means it is going to be having the fresh data so these buckets what normally we'll do these buckets are capturing fresh water from the tank right so wherever there is a fresh data that computers are called as OLTP computers so you go to Amazon open Amazon and try to establish and you would like to buy a laptop so one row will go so like that people are buying and buying buying and buying buying and buying the Java uh uh software is running it is going to be getting your daily transactional data many people are buying in Amazon right not only one guy so one day this computer also will become full one day many people are buying from us even this computer also will be full right if you go to a bucket and collecting the water this bucket will be full within 5 10 minutes right so this may be computer these computers are not big in size oltp computers are very very small in size but these are going to be having uh fresh data so you go collect the fresh water and dumping into the drum so what you need to understand OLTP means OLTP where the data is going to be collected and in the business fresh data is going to be collected it will be read and write data so write means 80% of the time it is going to be writing of the data you go to banking what you do you're going to be withdrawing the cash depositing the cash once in a while you see what is my balance so many people are going to be using writing so these are smallsized machines smallsized data you will have so what is the bucket size you tell me go to you take a bucket and go to the street what is the size of the bucket 30 40 liter but what what kind of a water fresh data fresh water and most of the time you're going to be collecting the water so OLTPS or computers in your business or in the IT industry which is going to be storing the fresh data any application which is storing the fresh data that is OLTP application remember this point for example phone pay phone pay what you do you are going to be transferring the funds to me first transaction so phone pay is OLTP application you go to banking so what you do you transfer funds you deposit the cash 1,000 rupees to the banking software that is a OLTP because whatever you are using that application is storing fresh data but once in a month once in a year that server also that computer that OLTP will be full right so once today it is empty keep on putting the water keep on putting the water after you know 20 minutes your bucket will be full so WTP servers will be smalls size servers and these are going to be getting fresh data mo most of the time these servers are busy to writing the data small size data and these applications are used by end users end users means you and me but what you need to understand here you need to understand here these are full after you know 1 month or 1 year this computer will be full remember this will be full this will be full this will be full this will be full after 1 year or 6 months so what you do you are going to be dumping all the water from here to here you clean the water cleaned water you are going to be dumping into this so this will become empty bucket this will become empty bucket okay this will become empty this will become empty empty bucket second time again these computers are going to be getting the pressure data every month you're going to be doing the transactions in the banking what will happen second month third month also you will get lot of data after uh 3 months or after 1 month your OLTP banking computers are will be full so but if it is full what you do you don't do anything the banking IT team is going to be taking all the data from the OLTP computers and dumping into where a OLA app or data warehousing computer so remember like that if you go to tirupati or any church what you do you're going to be putting lot of gifts right there are lot of hundies are going to be the gift boxes you're going to be donating lot of amount so every week what they do so fresh gifts fresh you know amount will be going into the basket but the basket will be full after one week or one month right soati the temple authorities will open the box will collect all the you know gifts and cash and from the gift boxes and they're going to be dumping into a bigger place so the hundi the gift box is nothing but a OLTP box oltp means fresh in a box where the customers are going to be donating lot of amount to the god right so God is not going to take but end of that if the box is full somebody has to open once in a week once in a 10 days right so like that you need to understand OLTP means where the customer comes and puts the data you go to phone pay you put the data you don't know that clear or not guys any questions here this is OLTP PE that is what you got to understand your data warehousing is nothing but your OLAP okay OLAP means what not fresh data it will be your historical data means online analytical every month you're going to be getting the data it will become historical data okay it is read only data because Last month the transactional data are going to be dumping nobody's going to be modifying every month small size means you assume you assume every month 500 GB of data you're going to be getting into the computer 30 liter of bucket 10 times what will happen 30 lit into 10 times 3,300 L like that so every month you're getting GBs of data slowly this will become large data like that so 500 GB B into 12 months data will become 6,000 GB equivalent to 6 terabytes of data one year data 10 data will be 60 terabytes of data slowly the data will be in terabytes maybe some 20 30 40 50 terabytes of data large data who's going to be using this data not you business users are going to be using this data now tell me last month data last year data last five years of your banking transaction data where it is it is gone to OLAP or data warehouse you go to bank and ask sir uh 10 years back I have opened my account tell me uh 10 years back uh I would like to know what was my balance people say no no no we cannot give you why banking is a OLTP application oltp means it may maintain only one year data 6 months data here remaining data once in a week once in a month all the data would have gone to data warehousing of of a banking so every company will have OLTP computers every company will have OLAP or data warehousing computers every day every month every weekend depends upon the size of the data the data may be going from OLTP to OLAP with the help of ETL clear so ETL is going to be extracting the data every Sunday midnight the job starts all the uh data it will be cleaned from fresh uh the OLTP servers and dumped onto the OLAP machines am I clear you should be able to have so last 10 20 years of the data where it is it is available in OLAP or data warehousing but if you keep the data that is not needed right if I keep the data who's going to be processing the data somebody has to process right end of the day so you assume every day you're getting the data for example I have data let us say I have some data 10 and 20 is there or you think you went to the shop buy some vegetables buy some more vegetables all the vegetables you cleaned them and you put them you have some vegetables here now tell me only if if you keep raw vegetables here is that sufficient what is your data warehouse data warehouse is going to be storing your raw data or not raw data cleaned data so your refrigerator is going to be having only the chicken uh curd potato everything is there but if you only keep the raw data is it sufficient you have to go to the kitchen and process the vegetable then only you can make a chicken biryani hello so you got to understand only if you keep you know the cleaned vegetables in the refrigerator food will not come out right you need to go to the kitchen and you have to process the data what is your kitchen now your kitchen is your uh your kitchen is your uh SSAS application clear here we are going to be using a cube so what is the cube and all you will understand you are going to be processing your data data warehousing is going to be used only storing a cleaned data remember data warehousing is your refrigerator think like that okay but if you store only this data that is not sufficient right because end of the day if I'm keeping potato tomato and the refrigerator what is the use to go to your kitchen what is your Kitchen kitchen is your S SAS you are going to be processing the data so I want to know what is the sum sum is 30 what is the average average is 15 what is the count two numbers are there what is the minimum 10 what is the maximum uh 20 i would like to sort the data i wanted to do lot of things here all the processing is going to be happening in your kitchen your kitchen where you are going to be making a lot of food so chicken kebab pizza you have a raw material which is available in the refrigerator so refrigerator is your data warehousing data warehouse will have a cleaned data and the last 10 20 years of data is going to be there every day every month you're going to be getting the data into the data warehousing and the fresh data will be stored in the OLTP oltp just like your bucket very small in size computers and it will be full every month or every quarter depends upon the the business okay in the seasonality Diwali and Ramadan means people are buying more and more products the computers are completely full within one week or one month of time if you don't have a big you know season then it will take a lot of time to uh fill the OLTP computers am I clear so if you clean the data is available in data warehousing so after that what you do you're going to be processing the data now I have given you only two numbers 10 and 20 but in the real time you will have a billions of data trillions of data now you assume the summing operation is not so easy the average is not so easy the minimum on the trillions of data is not so easy but we don't do only one sum we'll say what is the total sales in Hyderabad what is the total sales in Pune what is the total sales in India what is the total sales in US what is the total sales for Apple iPhone model number 16 what is the sales of Sony Bravia TV what is the sales of men clothing what is the sales of women clothing what is the sales of Apple iPhone brand what is the sales versus Apple iPhone and non-Apple i want to know what is the kids you know sales what is the sales for vegetables what is the sales for the fruits what is the sales for the north India South India you ask thousands of questions for each and everything you are going to be processing the data in your S SAS am I clear so that is what is your kitchen you can prepare any food with the help of a chicken chicken biryani chicken pizza chicken burger uh chicken kebab so whatever you would like to do it you have to go to the kitchen and do it now SS is where the processing is going to be happening so once you prepare the food what you need to do you need to serve the food right so how do you serve it neatly you are going to be serving the food in the plate the plate is your power bea so you have processed the food here this food will be taken and put it into the plate you neatly organize you create a neat chart so this is your PowerBI or reporting tool this tool you're going to be giving it to the customer or a business user okay so PowerBI is your plate you take the draw data you're going to be creating one chart and the chart they will understand okay sales of you know last five years uh Apple iPhone sales is increasing in South India decreasing in North India two reports you're going to be giving so getting the data cleaning the data storing the data into the uh data warehousing processing the data with the help of SS and serving the data to the customer in the plate the plate will be reporting tool like SSRS also you can use or PowerBI we are going to be using so this is what you got to understand this is the data analytics architecture right from the data warehouse you can take so from the data warehousing even AI people also can take the data they can also analyze AI so we are called BI right so AI people also can take your data they will do a lot of patterns on this data am I clear guys so anybody can want to use the data means they have to build compulsory data warehousing so get the data perform material operations pro store the data process the data all these things are called data engineering all these activities are data engineering activities collecting the data collecting the data and putting into data warehousing and processing the data and after that you're going to be dumping into your plates clear your PowerBI is going to be getting the data from where it is going to be getting the data from your uh kitchen so you have prepared the food here right so that you're going to be dumping into your PowerBI powerbi where you're going to be making a lot of reports so reports are going to be made on what processor data right i wanted to know what is the sales uh what is the last five years sales in India now you need to take the raw data and create perform the summing operations for last five years and get the five rows the five rows will be given to whom will be given to the PowerBI powerbi will create a reports clear it will show you the chart uh last five years 2020 2021 like that blah blah blah year wise sales it can show you in the report so getting the raw data processing the last five years of the data because you're going to be making lot of summing operations right so can you do summing operations for India sales manually can you do that if I give you some data manually can you sum the data and send it to me you cannot do because it will be trillions and millions of data we're talking about clear so you cannot do it manually data warehousing will be having a terabyte of data the data will be uh fed into the S SAS it will give you you ask a question what is the question i wanted to have last five years sales only of India last five years of sales only of US so the crunching the processing the summing work is going to be happening in the one more factory the factory called SSAS clear but once that is done you have to get that five rows and create a chart who's going to be creating a chart for that a PowerB is going to be getting those five rows and converting into a report clear so that is what you need to understand so getting the data storing the data processing the data will be data engineering work creating a report will be PowerBI work so PowerBI developer has to know not only uh PowerBI you should know SQL you should know data warehousing you should know ETL you should know SSA as everything a PowerB developer should know clear powerbi will not get the data powerbi will be able to get the data after cleaning work after everything is done you are going to be getting the processed data and you're going to be creating a report out of that okay am I clear this report will be given to whom decision makers your business users your Amazon company CEO Amazon company management will be taking the reports and they will be taking the decisions based on your reports clear you only take the data clean the data store the data create a reports and give it to them did you understand clearly this is how the uh architecture about the uh data analyt data analytics team is going to be working clear data engineering role also are going to be playing getting the data storing the data processing the data data engineering means ETL work only data engineering means what work etl work you're going to be doing so companies are going to be making lot of work like that only PowerB developer cannot do anything lot of other teams also having SS team may be separate data warehousing team may be separate uh powerba team may be separate or in the smaller company you need to do all the activities also clear you should know SQL you should know SSIS you should know SSAS you should know data warehousing you should know PowerBI also clear so I'm going to be giving you SQL server PowerBI SSIS everything in order to start learning it so what is the thing I'm going to be giving you i told you already so first two months we're going to be practicing SQL server and powerbi and the third month we're going to be learning SSIS in 25 hours data warehouse in 10 hours SS and the fourth fifth sixth month we are going to be doing assignments project CV preparation interview preparation start giving the interviews clear so these are the five modules we have to cover from tomorrow so I'll install SQL server and powerbi Okay so this videos will be given i don't have the live classes but these are live classes remember okay sql server I don't have the live classes i'm not having the time to take the classes but SQL server I'm going to be giving you videos once you make the payment daily morning you need to attend PowerBI and evening you need to watch take 1 hour video okay you just watch only 15 minutes you watch and take a break write the notes if you don't have a mood leave it after some time you start watching like that complete 15 minutes 10 minutes video a 1 hour video break it into four five parts write the notes and complete within the day sql server is very very very important many people will come sir my trainer taught me PowerB for 20 hours SQL for 2 hours or 5 hours i'm not able to crack any interview you never crack an interview if you learn this kind of a courses you don't know because the trainer itself does not know how to prepare is a a bookish knowledge guy right so I'm having almost 25 years of experience i have taken lot of interviews for the data analytics companies like Accenture Microsoft i know what kind of a question they ask in the interview not PowerBI you you'll be drilling on lot of SQL questions we'll ask you you ask anybody whatever I'm teaching 90 to 95% of the syllabus I'm going to be covering uh for the data analytics when you go for any interview you will say me sir whatever you have taught only those questions people are asking nothing else people who are cracking 30 lakh salary packages they tell me sir your SQL your powerbi your SSIS data warehousing that only people are asking I'm able to get 27 lakhs 30 lakhs package So this is a completely tailored and it is applied on thousands of students and this is what you need to practice that's it nothing else and if you have any questions anytime SQL questions or any questions I have given my number you can call me anytime first two months we're going to be practicing this next month we're going to be going for this guys and uh this is what is the syllabus and these are the things I'm going to be giving you videos And these are the live classes we can have if it is there otherwise videos you need to take it and watch it and uh this is the final demo of you know our data analytics clear so today how ETLs can be performed how a data warehousing can be implemented how reports are going to be implemented i have given you a theory but practically from day after tomorrow we're going to be understanding uh so tomorrow I'll show you how to install PowerBI how to install SQL server in your laptop and today is the final demo from tomorrow this meeting link will change so I will give you the payment links and everything you can make the payment and uh send the screenshots guys okay i'm sure you can become a data analyst in 100 days but only thing is that you need to have daily two hours of practice you need to have so time is not important goal is important right you may take 3 months or 6 months or 9 months one year doesn't matter i have taken 2 years initially to get to get the job into IT industry that is how I took 2 years but many people will not be putting two years today because when you have a good mentor uh you will be able to crack interview within 3 to 6 months of time i do not have a proper mentor at that time i took two years to go into IT industry from that different industry right so anybody can become anything in this world prop if you have proper mentors otherwise it'll be of no use so tomorrow you cannot blame anybody guys any questions if you have you can ask me did you like that class guys

[Music] hey guys welcome back e-video delhi now database so what is a database what are the different types of database database so the very very very important question what is a database database is a small box where we can store some data it's a small box or a small container elements but when someone asks you a question tell that database is a software or a place where we can store some data or large amount of data at the end of the day it's a place where we can store some data we have something called as Excel we have something called a spreadsheet so excellence then why do you want a database right so our question is you can store data in Excel you can store data in spreadsheet other database so consider money Flipkart Ember on the website you'll get lots of products so our particular products what will be your answer hello it is coming from a database when the data source in the data so why a database is required to store some data and also display that particular data is database so let us see an example think that this is your system in my laptop on the delivery your laptop display and this is my box where I store some data so called database okay what is this so this is my database and this is my laptop a laptop display foreign we have something called as database management system dbms so e particular dbm request s this particular data otherwise database now from here we will send that particular query now queries and execute Modi much more about structure query languages coming up so good so database system foreign next they have two types of database one is relational database no SQL no relational database or there were no structured query language so there are two types of databases one is a relational one is no SQL so now e-corsally relational databaseql number next to course foreign foreign consider this this is relational database now on the e-commerce application I e-commerce application select customers a person who buys steps is a customer I e-commerce applications [Music] foreign okay getting my point so e-commerce applications on the user who is coming to purchase something one is a product which is which has to be purchased in on the orders table interrelated customer product a new purchase customer purchase entities entities relational database we call it as relational database so customers order and products are related okay the customer is related to the order based on the product product is related to the order based on the customer okay so e different entities related we call it as relational database so now a relational database management system [Music] so relationship we have something called as structured query language database structured query languages okay so we are learning relational database so now a relational database only relational database and communicate application in the database you can communicate multiplication of structured query languages and you smart either great next different examples of relational database management system first one is MySQL in on the example Ms SQL Server is so these three are the good examples for relational database Management Systems there are lots and lots of databases okay so relational database management system Ali these three are very high level databases foreign the one important aspect to understand no SQL system do not understand SQL so is calling no SQL system structured query languages so that is entirely different compared to relational database will have a separate course on that regarding nosql databases foreign so initially it was like sequel okay SQL in thiruvaga Structured English query language Structured English query language structured query languages okay so now questions SQL or SQL so we'll consider SQL I personally like SQL okay so now e particular course SQL with mySQL use so now SQL emba language database so we are using SQL but we are using it with mySQL database so furthermore now my Allah queries now mySQL database by using S given query so that's the flow take care [Music] thank you

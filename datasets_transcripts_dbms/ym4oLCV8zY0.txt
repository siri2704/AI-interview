welcome back design Enthusiast now that we have explored both the SQL and the nosql databases the natural question is how do you choose between them so let's dive into some general guidelines that can help you to decide but keep in mind it's not always black and white your choice will often depend on the specific needs of your project first speed if you need very fast data access no SQL databases might be generally preferred overse no SQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data and can retrieve the information pretty quickly making them a great choice for realtime applications next is scale when the scale is too large no SQL databases tend to perform better than the SQL databases no SQL databases are built to scale horizontally meaning that you can add more database servers to handle more data this makes them ideal for applications with massive amounts of data like social media platforms on Big Data applications but what if your data fits into a fixed structure this should prompt us to think about SQL databases if your data is well organized and has a consistent predefined format like the user data which we saw you know fields for name email phone number address Etc this kind of data goes very well with the SQL databases on the other hand if your data doesn't fit into a fix structure no SQL should be your choice remember our ear example of social media posts that kind of unstructured data would go well with the no SQL databases another consideration is the complexity of your queries if you have complex queries that needs to be executed on your data SQL is the par Choice SQL databases are designed for intricate queries that involve multiple tables compx joints and filtering but if your queries are simpler and more straightforward no SQL databases can handle them just fine they are optimized for quick easy access to the data without the need for complex querying or operations lastly let's talk about flexibility if your data changes frequently or is likely to evolve over time go for a nosql database nosql databases support a flexible structure allowing you to add new Fields change the format of your data without much hassle this is particularly useful for rapidly evolving applications where the data model is in sit in stone so in summary SQL databases great for structure data complex queries at applications where you can expect the data to be in consistent format no SQL databases on the other hand are perfect for unstructured data large scale applications and scenarios where flexibility and speed are the key you got it right flexibility and adaptability can take you much further than rigidity after all in both databases and life the ability to evolve with the times can be the key to success remember these are just general guidelines and the best choice often depends on the unique requirements of your project it's all about finding the right tool for your job stay tuned for the next one [Music]

all right so now we're going to be solving an eer diagram problem to uh maybe understand it a little bit better because practicing will make it better I hope so yeah as a question reads an organization depends on a number of different types of person for its successful operation the organization is interested in the following attributes SSN name address and telephone a person may have multiple telephone numbers three types of uh person are of greatest interest and employes volunteers and donors so as you can as as it as it suggests person is one generalized entity and employees uh volunteers and donors are its sub classes employees only have a date hired attribute and volunteers only have a skill attribute so these are the specialized attributes and um donors only have a relationship blah blah blah all right so let's just draw it a little bit and then we'll continue on to the next part because for me it's like if I don't uh start drawing from now I forget what the question actually meant from the beginning so let's just draw it out all right so we have a person's entity and the qualities that a person has are the attributes a person has is um SSN name address and telephone SSN which is obviously a primary key SSN name address and telephone number uh well in the telephone number one we have my person may have multiple telephone numbers so which suggests that this is a multivalued attribute because they said it's multiple excuse my drawing it said it's a multi uh mult it has the a person may have multiple telephone numbers all right so telephone all right so a person may then three types of persons are of greatest interest all right so let's just draw the subclasses we'll specify later if it's distinct or overlapping we'll continue on reading the question if it's not specified then we can use our own assumption okay so the entities that we have are three employee volunteers and donors employee volunteer and donor all right so employees only have a higher date and um a volunteers only have a skill attribute so and wait let me just put the subset sign right so employees have a hired date age date and volunteers have a skill attribute right so yeah skill attribute and donors only have relationship uh donates with an item that has name and number so donor does not have a specialist attribute but it has a relationship and it's called donate Ates all right so donates and then donates an item with an which has a name and number so donates an item which has a name and a number which could be our p uh key attribute all right so um a donor must have donated one or more items one donor must have donated many items uh and an item may have no donors or one donor an item must have just one donor and an item must be um uh an item is partial it has a partial participation I mean it's not total because they said that item could not an item if it's given it's it could be donated or it could not be donated so it could like uh it could not have any more donor so it it's not partial uh like sorry the the participation is partial it's not total but a donor must donate something or else why would they be called donors right all right so okay so there are three there are persons other than employees volunteers and donors who are of interest to the organization so that a person does not need to belong does not belong to any of these three groups all right so as we can suggest so uh as it suggest that um their per their person other than employees so it won't be a double line it will be a single line so let's just rub it off so it will just be one single line and uh on the other hand at a given time a person may belong to two or two or more of these groups so the constraint that we have is that it's overlapping means an a person could be an employee or a volunteer at the same time or a volunteer or a donor at the same or three of them at the same time right so yeah uh that's what it was really simple I guess but I hope it covered some of the parts it will be easy e e diagrams are easy uh and uh these are the typical kind of questions that occur and at the end of the question they said write down assumptions if any you making the answer so this this was kind of our assumption like a donor a donor has to donate something so this is this was our assumption so at the end you you could have just write assumptions that a donor has to donate something so you just write that and then that was our assumption that was our only assumption but other things were pretty much clear and specific U this was the only thing that was kind of vague and we had to um um on our own kind of like uh assume that this was a total participation anyway I hope you understood uh how eer diagrams could be questions could be solved and I hope you Ace your exams knowing that you kind of learned something and please like And subscribe if you want more tutorials and the schema dagram tutorial is coming on thank you for watching

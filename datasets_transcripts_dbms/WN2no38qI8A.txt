[Music] thank you welcome in this short tutorial we will see how to install mySQL database management system but before we install it we'll see why MySQL as a database for this course why did we choose it we choose it for four reasons it is supported by Oracle which ensures reliability and durability which will be very important as we start using databases very often it supports multi-user access that means a lot of users can be created in this database it supports multiple storage engines depending upon what Hardware system we use the storage engines can be can be different as well in mySQL database and very important it is very very widely used across the industry so that gives us a network effect that since a lot of other people use it so we also use it then our formats would be compatible with other users as well so that makes MySQL as one of the top choice to use as a database Madam system in this particular course there are three factors to consider before installing any database management system specifically for MySQL the first factor is the operating system that on which you will install in this tutorial we will cover windows but you can install MySQL using almost a similar steps on Mac OS or on Linux the second factor to consider is what to use to install MySQL there are a lot of other lot of third party tools available in the industry which will help you to install MySQL we will use the official MySQL installer which is a very popular choice to install mySQL database management system in this tutorial the third factor to consider is what are the features to use in MySQL so we'll see lot of other a lot of features are available in MySQL whether you want to install it locally whether you're going to install it on a remote server and there are a lot of other features that may be relevant to us as the time comes along we will keep talking about that for now we even use one of the most important installation feature which is we will install the mySQL database server on our local machine say for example your local laptop now these are the four high level steps we will use to install mySQL database manual system first we will download and install MySQL installer second we will use this installer to install a few important components of mySQL database management system the first will be the mySQL database server the most important component that's where we will host all the databases that we will create for using in our course MySQL workbench is the graphical user interface which allows us to interact with the databases that we will create in database manual server and then there are other important components as the time comes along in the course we will talk about them one is called as MySQL shell which is like a command line prompt the black screen with which you can directly interact with the database server without having to install any graphical user interface like workbench MySQL router which helps you to connect new database server with remote graphical user interfaces or any other third-party clients that we will use in the forthcoming lectures then the third step would be to configure the installed mySQL database server and then the fourth and the final step would be to use MySQL workbench and connect with the mySQL database server so these are the four steps that we will perform today so let's get to it what we will do is that we will directly go to Google we will search for download MySQL installer the first link that comes along here which is download MySQL installer we will click on it which will be official link as you can see dave.mysql.com that's the official link from where we can install the installer as well as the other components of mySQL database menu system I am going to download the first bit here which says Windows x86 32-bit depending upon my computer right now is 32-bit so I'm installing the 34 32-bit one if your computer is 64-bit you will install that so I'm going to click on download now when I click on download it shows you this my SQL Community downloads it allow it asks you to create an oracle account for now I'm going to skip it and so I'll just click on note thanks just start my download and it downloads it over here you can see it so I'm going to click on it it'll start to install it It'll ask you some for some permission say yes remember you should have logged in as an admin or your local machine in order to install mySQL database management system so it's going to take a few seconds and again it may ask you for some permission please go ahead and get that and then it will give you this prompt which says it's about getting done so now we are inside MySQL installer it is asking you to choose the setup to install there are a lot of different setup options here available for Simplicity we will just go ahead and install the full version which will basically install all these components now two very important components that we are right now interested in is MySQL server and MySQL workbench which will allow us to graphically connect with the MySQL server and then there are a lot of documentation help documentation samples and examples which are also going to be installed so I'm going to click on next when I click on next it'll look for some requirements and if there are certain requirements in your machine in your laptop which are failing it will try and install those requirements as well and that's one of the benefits of using MySQL installer so I'm just going to click on execute do not click on next right now please click on execute so that it can install all these requirements which are important for mySQL database management system so to work on your machine so I click on execute and then it's going to start downloading these different components which are required and it may ask you to install certain components which are important for the database filing system to work I'm just going to click on OK and now it starts to install the requirements which are important for installing database management system so it may take some time be patient but this is an important step it will install these components which are required for dbms to function properly now here it says setup successful for the requirements I'm going to click on close now it's going to install the other components so just be patient there if there is an agreement prompt please go ahead and accept it once it is done it will give you this prompt click on finish it may not give all these prompts it may depend upon your machine as to what all components were already there and what are components MySQL server installer try to install on your machine so I click on next it may give you another problem saying one or more product requirements have not been satisfied that's fine click on yes so that it can be installed so now it says these are the components which are ready to be installed on your machine click on execute and then it will start downloading you will see the progress as well here do not worry about these try again for some of these things which may come try again we will try them again if you get this message the very important components which are right over here the first one first two MySQL server and workbench for now that those are the two very important components that we are concerned about now once it is downloaded once these packages are downloaded then we'll try and install them so you would you would have seen the progress part showed you progress first for downloading and then for installing so just be patient here especially the server and the workbench may take a little bit of time so if you now notice the two very important components are done MySQL server installation as well as downloading it done for one punch also it's done now it is try to install my MySQL shell so now if you notice most of the components are done if you want you can give a few of them try again so try to download these again and if they get downloaded it's fine otherwise the two important components that we were interested to download right now this MySQL server as well as MySQL workbench they are done so we will go to next then it will ask you to configure these two products MySQL server and MySQL router MySQL server we will definitely configure so let's go to next now it says what kind of installation do you want to do Standalone that means you're going to stand alone install on your local machine or you want to do it in like a cluster which is more like client server architecture that we will discuss later for now we will go with Standalone MySQL server then it will ask you to configure the networking here since we are installing locally here so we will not touch these options for now and we'll go to next then it says what kind of authentication very important authentication method that you want to use if you use a strong password encryption for authentication you have to remember a longer password a little more complex password or if you want to use a legacy or authentication method then it will allow you to create a simpler password for now since we're installing locally and since we're going to do a lot of hit and trial I want to make sure that we do not forget the password so I'm going to go with Legacy authentication method for to do for now and when I click on next I'll ask you what is going to the root password you give your whatever root password but do remember to write it somewhere so that you do not forget what you have used here because we will use it when we connect to mySQL database server later it says week I have kept a very simple password for now then it says how MySQL server service would be shown on your machine when it's working so it's I have said I have said that the default name is fine Windows service name mysql80 because my SQL Server will work as a Windows service if you want to understand what Windows services are you can just Google on this word Windows services and you will get a lot of information on that for now I'll also select one very important thing here which is start the MySQL server.system startup because we are learning mySQL database as a base database in this course I do not want to be hassled by starting the service again and again so I will just keep it enabled keep it checked so that when the system starts it will automatically start then I'll go to next then we'll apply this configuration I'll say execute starts to applying these configuration now it'll give you some prompts here which is a Services list changed Services list changed and just you don't have to do anything just keep an eye click on finish so now you're ready to configure so I click on next I will not configure the router right now because again we are installing locally we are not connecting with a remote machine so I'll click on next then it says start my SQL workbench after startup we will do that I finish it will give me this command line prompt right now and it also will give me something called as my SQL workbench which is the graphical user interface tool to connect with the mySQL database server so I will keep it on I will in fact expand it so now I can see here on the bottom left hand side of my screen that I have a local instance of MySQL 80 MySQL is 80 meaning 8.0 is the version of the database that I have installed so if I click on this icon here this box here then what this MySQL workbench will do is that it will establish a connection with the database server that we have installed so if I click on this thing here it'll ask me to give the password now remember the password that we had given at the time of installation I'll give the same password here and this time I'll save the password involved assuming I will be the only user for this machine so I click on OK and now it opens the connection with my SQL database server and we are ready to start or start creating our first database and start writing SQL queries as well so we'll stop at this point of time I'll just quickly review the steps that we did so we downloaded and installed MySQL server installer using that installer we installed a lot of components the two very important components that we installed here were mySQL database server and MySQL workbench MySQL workbench was the graphical user interface and connect with the mySQL database server the other components that it installed were MySQL shell and MySQL router the third step that we did here was that we configured the mySQL database server and we gave passwords if you remember and then we started MySQL workbench and we connected with the mySQL database server so that's where we will stop for today if you would have any questions or if you face any problem in the discussion forum please post your question thank you foreign [Music]

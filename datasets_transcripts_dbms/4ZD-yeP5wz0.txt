ever wondered what happens when two processes keep waiting forever let's dive into deadlock avoidance in DBMS imagine two friends reaching a narrow bridge from opposite sides neither wants to step back so they both get stuck in DBMS a deadlock happens when two or more transactions hold resources and wait indefinitely for each other to release them to avoid deadlocks we can use techniques like the resource allocation graph if a cycle forms it signals a possible deadlock another method is the wait for graph if a cycle is detected we take action before a deadlock occurs we also have smart algorithms to prevent deadlocks meet weight die and wound weight in weight die an older transaction waits while a younger one is aborted in wound weight an older transaction wounds forces roll back the younger one and continues execution deadlocks slow down systems and cause failures using these avoidance techniques ensures smooth database operations want to learn more about DBMS

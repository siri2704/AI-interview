everyone I am until Kaur and I am currently working as an instructor at scalar Academy so people welcome back again from this video we'll be starting with the complete tutorial on dbms and SQL so from very basic to advanced concepts we will be covering each and every topic in great dating and the interesting patterns along with the theory we'll be covering practical aspect also so for every topic we'll actually see how they are practically implemented so if you want to grab placements internships or you are in college and dbms is your subject just go through these videos and you are good today now let me quickly go to all the topics which we cover first is what is BBFS like why it's so crucial it's actually the backbone of entire tech industry so why it is so important then relational database Management Systems the different keys in our database which we are always confused like what is primary key what is unique what is candidate key so we'll be covering all the keys in the database with the help of different Technologies and examples then of course ER diagram entity relationship diagram so we cover ER diagram with the help of a case stud and in trust in case then normalizations different normal points then going on to their skill Parts in SQL we'll be covering broad operations and the important topic which joins aggregate functions complex queries right then in advanced concepts like transactions indexes views concurrency so open people say like indexes reduce the time complexity uh here to query in the database faster but how virtual indexes are created how actually views are created we want different views for different end users right for example in a college database for student we want different views we want different view of the data right and for instructors for mentors for teachers we want different view of the database right but how actually views are created so we'll actually create views and indexes on our tables then transactions asset properties which is the most important topic of interviews right but how actually essay properties are conserved in transactions the different stages the different levels of transactions so we'll be covering all down and how do people are concurrently accessing the same database at the same time how this is actually possible so what is condensing how concurrency is actually implemented so we'll be covering all the advanced concepts and basic concepts with SQL in great detail so I hope you are also as excited as I am now without further delay let's quickly jump into the region

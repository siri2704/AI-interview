[Music] hello friends welcome back to our channel so in today's session we'll discuss about the notations of er diagram so in the previous session we have discussed about the ear model so what is an er model and what are the components of vr model so ear model is a design phase so that means design of a database so in order to design that one so we have to use some graphical representation diagrammatic representation of a database so using this graphical representation or a diagrammatic representation so we have to use the symbols for all the components of a year model so we will see what are the notations to represent the components of ear model so notations of er diagram er diagram right so first let us recall the components the components are entity attribute and the relationship so entity attribute and relationship so these are the components and we have to draw the ear diagram based upon these components so in that we know that it's a strong entity so two categories a strong entity and weak entity so here in the ear diagram the strong entity is represented as a rectangle box rectangle box so this represents the strong entity this represents the strong negative coming to the weak entity double rectangle box is represented as a weak entity so this is represented as a weak entity okay so if in our ear diagram if you want to represent any weak entity we have to draw this double rectangle coming to the attributes the first one key attribute so this key attribute so generally the attribute so generally the entity is represented as this one attribute is represented as an over over right and relationship is represented as a rhombus or a diamond symbol okay now key attribute is represented as google with underline so underlining the key right and single attribute or a simple attribute simple attribute is a normal ellipse it is represented as a normal ellipse and multi-valued multi-valued attribute is represented as double ellipse double ellipse is represented as a multi value right so this is a multi-valued attribute and derived attribute so derived attribute is represented as a dotted ellipse dotted ellipse right so this is a derived attribute and a composite attribute so i'll write right here composite attribute composite attribute is represented as so extension that means again it will be derived as different attributes so this this type we can consider as a composite attribute right so further divided one attribute dividing further okay next the relationship it is represented with a diamond or a rhombus so this is for relating the strong entity strong entity the relation for a strong entity coming to the weak entity so double diamond is a relation for weak entity double diamond is a relation for weak entity so these are the notation for components used in er diagram or er model so these are the three components entity attribute and relation so entity strong entity and weak entity attributes the key single multi-value derived and composite and similarly the relationship so it is usually represented as a diamond and a normal diamond symbol is used to give a relation between the strong entities and if you want to give a relation between the weak entities that will be represented as this double rhombus or double diamond right so hope you understood this notation so by using these notations we have to draw the er model or er diagram right so in the further sessions we'll see the diagram the complete er diagram okay so let's stop here i hope you understood this one and if you are having any doubts regarding this one feel free to post your doubts in the comment section definitely i will try to clarify all your doubts if you really enjoyed my session like my session share my session with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to our channel thanks for watching thank you very much

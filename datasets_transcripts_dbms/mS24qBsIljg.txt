hacks to write complex SQL query the first one is use describe and explain commands in order to understand the table relationships and the second one is if there is a complex problem break down into simple problems so how exactly you can solve each simple problem is by using a subquery within your SQL and the third step is try to leverage joints so but there is a problem while you are using a joints there may be problem of creating a cartisan product if there is a cartisan product it may give raise to the drop in the performance of your query so that's the reason you need to make sure while you're using a joints there is no cartisan product you need to check that and the another point is like you need to use wear Clause so by using a wear Clause instead of getting all the data you are trying to use that wear Clause so that the data going to be filtered what is needed for your particular quiry and the final one is so try to go with your indexing for your most important column so by doing indexing the performance of your query can be increased

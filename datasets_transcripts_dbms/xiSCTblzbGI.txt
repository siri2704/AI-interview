data model is a collection of concept that which we are using in order to have a description of a database if I say student entity then student is the name of an entity and student attributes will be used together what I can say that is an entity type if you have this primary key or key attribute with the help of that I can identify the entity in a unique manner mainly we are going to use this model in order to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system foreign [Music] first grade College the Temple of Excellence mysuru so in our today's session we'll going to see what you mean by ER model along with that I will let you know what are the ER model Concepts we have along with this first topic I will be discussing what you mean by an entity and what are the types of entities we have that is entity type and also I will be discussing regarding entity set and at last we'll see what you mean by an attribute and what are the different types of attribute we have so we'll see the first topic that is regarding ER model or ER model Concepts already you know about the data model that is what we have learned in the previous sessions so as you all know that data model is a collection of concept that which we are using in order to have a description of a database so for that reason we are going to have a data model and here we have a ER model that is entity relationship model this is also considered as what high level data model moreover it stands for entity relationship model in short that is er model and it is high level or conceptual level data model so here we can expect more abstraction that is what we are having in the year model mainly we are going to use this model in order to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system so your main concerning is regarding what are the different data elements we have that means an entity and what is the relationship between one entity to another entity already all know regarding the conceptual data model there we are describing a description of a database in the terms of an entity an attribute as well as the a relationship so that entity is what what you mean by an attribute along with what is the relationship or association between the different entities by Method by that methodology we are describing or we are having this ER model and mainly develops a conceptual design for the database as I told earlier here we are going to have a conceptual schema by making use of that we can have a conceptual design if we have a conceptual design then we are going to describe the data elements and their relationship among the different data elements and also it develops a very simple and easy to design view of data with the help of this diagrammatic representation we call that as What entity relationship diagram or we also call this as a ER diagram so with the help of this entity relationship diagram or ER diagram we can show the database structure which will going to be displayed as a diagram as we all know that what one image is equal to thousand words instead of keep on explaining regarding certain scenario if I am showing a pic to you then it will be easy for you to understand same thing here we are going to have a diagrammatic representation of a database structure then we call that as a entity relationship diagram or ER diagram with the help of this we are describing or we are explaining this ER model mainly in order to do the designing or definition of a data elements and its relation we have this ER model I hope you all understood regarding this year model so now we'll see what do you mean by an entity what is an attribute and what is relationship one by one first we'll see what you mean by an entity any real world object is considered as what an entity so this is what real world object it can be either animated or inanimated it can be physically present or logically present and also can be easily identifiable with a particular attributes or properties we are going to find out the real world object if I consider a water bottle how can I get to know that is a water bottle it will going to have certain feature it has a cap it has a container it will going to have certain shape color belongs to particular company on manufacturer with the help of all those attributes we can identify an entity so that that can be any real world element or an object an entity may be an object with physical existence or it may be an object with conceptual existence so it can be physically or virtually or logically may present in the database so we'll see what are the categories we have in an entity it is of two type one is tangible entity and another one is intangible entity when it comes to the tangible entity and entities are those entities which exist in the real world physically so if you consider a person if you consider an employee Department school colleges car so all those are what physically we have existence for all those entity that object then we call that kind of entity as tangible entity then whatever this intangible entity so which entities are those entities which exist only logically which is not physically present but in conceptual manner or in The Logical manner that are present but they have no physical existence you can take the railway reservation system and you can take the bank account so all those are not physically existed they have it in the terms of logical existence or conceptual existence okay so all these entities have some attributes or properties that will going to give the identity for this entity if I consider bank account as an entity then how can I get to know that is bank account that will going to have a bank ID and that is located in particular location that may be related to particular person or individual so with the help of certain attribute or property we are going to identify what kind of an entity it is fine this is regarding an entity next we'll see about the entity types what do you mean by an entity type so here an entity type describe a set of entity what it is describing it is a collection of entities or set of entity that have the same attribute but each entity has its own values for each attribute so here I have a set of entities or collection of entity all the entities will going to have a same attribute but the value of an attribute will be differ from one attribute to another attribute then we call that as a entity type remember I'm going to have a student entity I am going to have a teacher entity okay so all these will going to have a student ID student name phone number like that and this teacher will going to have a teacher's ID teacher's name age and their date of birth as well as salary so that all these attribute will going to have a same attribute but that attributes will that value of attributes will be differ from one entity to another entity then we call that as What entity type it will be collection of entities or a set of entity that have a same attribute if I consider a student one student two student three all the entity will going to have a same attribute every student has student ID name is date of birth and parents detail so all attributes are same for student one student to student 3 as well but the value of all those attribute will going to be differ from one student to another student then we call that as What entity type so set of entity types Define the part of database schema so whenever we have a collection of entity types then that will going to be defined as a sub part of database schema and each entity type in the database is described by the name and attributes if I say student entity then student is the name of an entity and student attributes will be used together what I can say that is an entity type so that an entity type in the database will going to be described by its name as well as the attribute and for each entity type there will be a multiple entities of that type as I said earlier if I consider a student entity then there may be n number of students there may be 10 number of students so each entity will going to have a want to store the data in the database and each of them described by the same collection of attribute even student one and student 50 both are going to have a same attribute the value of an attribute will be differ from one entity to another entity the value of those attribute will be differ from one entity to another entity this is what you all need to remember okay and then entity type will going to serves as the template so for what reason we are considering this as a template or a standard for a collection of entity instances so here already you know what a snapshot or what is instance so when it comes to the entity instance what is the entity value at a particular moment then we call that as an entity instance so then it will be a collection of instances if you take an example of objects and classes so class is what class is a template that we're going to hold a collection of object then we are calling that object as a entity instance and that class we're going to perform the role of this entity type same way if this entity type is a set or collection of this entity instances all which we are described by the same collection of attribute same collection of attribute will be there but the values of an attribute will be different from one entity to another entity then how do we represent this entity type in a ER diagram so each entity type is denoted by a rectangular box so we are going to use a rectangular box in order to specify this entity type in a ER diagram fine then here you can see what are the different entity types we have we have a strong entity type and weak entity type what do you mean by stronger weak in the entity type here you have a answer for that here we have a strong entity as I told earlier each entity will going to have its own attribute if we have any key attribute in order to identify that entity uniquely then we can say that as a strong entity T for example I have 50 students in one class okay and each student will going to have a name ID age roll number as well as their date of birth and the course taken fine then how can I say that this is a particular student or how can we recognize that as a particular student so there may be a chances of having the same name there could be a chances of having same address but each student will going to have a unique role number or unique ID with that help of that role number or unique ID we are identifying a student so when an entity has a key attribute in order to make it unique then we can say that kind of entity as what strong entity so which has a key attribute with the help of this key attribute I am identifying that entity uniquely so that the primary key will going to help us in order to identify each entity in the so if you have this primary key or key attribute with the help of that I can identify the entity in a unique Manner and it will be represented with the help of rectangle also and as you taken the example of roll number that is going to helpful for the uh Alpha for us in order to identify the student entity uniquely then what about this example here you can see that here we have a student as I told earlier it will going to be in the ear diagram we are going to use a rectangle symbol in order to represent the entity this is strong entity how can I say this is strong entity because here I have a key attribute so the attribute will going to be given or described with the help of this oval so if I have a name of an attribute which is underline then we can say that as a key attribute or a primary key so all the students we have here so with the help of this role ID or roll number I can specify or I can identify a student uniquely then we can say that as a strong entity type so here we have a age name H could be same if you have in a class H could be same gender could be same even their name could also be same but we can identify them with their roll number or role ID then we can say this as what strong entity type then what about this week entity type it is just a vice verse of that strong entity if we have a key attribute to identify an entity strong entity if we don't have a key attribute to identify an entity then weak entity so we can entity type does not have any key attribute so it can't be identified by on its own you just imagine you are in some marriage functions or something what people used to ask that is what it mean people are identifying you by your parents so that that parent will going to play a strong entity and their attribute is inheriting to you that means you are making you are identifiable with your parents so your weak entity type when we don't have our own key attribute in order to identify entity type unitly then we can say that as a week entity type so it depends on some other strong entity for its distinct identity as they taken the exam until now there can be there can be children only if the parents exist so this children can be identifiable or uniquely identifiable only when we have this parent exist or parent entity so that parent entity will going to play a strong entity role with the help of that we are identifiable that is what weak entity type fine here you can see the next thing so there can be no independent existence of children if there is no parent exist and it is represented by a double outline rectangle how do we represent the strong entity with a rectangle if it is weak entity then it will be double lined or double outline rectangle fine and we are going to use a diamond symbol or rhombus symbol in order to specify the relationship so here the relationship between a weak entity type and strong entity type is coiled and identity defying relationship understand I have a weak entity I have a strong entity I wanted to build a relationship between these two and we are going to use this rhombus or diamond symbol in order to give a relationship between the weak and strong then we are calling that relationship as what identifying relationship then how do we write this in the ER diagram it will be with the terms of double outline Diamond instead of writing a single outline Diamond imagine here I have a strong entity and here we have a weak entity how do I get to know this is wrong and weak if it is a double outline rectangle weak if it is a single outline the rectangle strong now I wanted to have a relationship between this strong and weak entity then instead of writing it in the single diamond we have to write double outlined double outline rhombus or diamond shape why because this is going to help us in order to identify the relationship between strong and weak entity and this specifies the identifying relationship here you can say that an example here we have weak entity type address and we have a customer as a strong entity type and here we have a customer ID that is key attribute mobile number age name and gender this customer has an address how do I get to know the address of that person that will going to be depend on a entity called customer why because each customer will going to have their address so that this specifies the identifying relationship and this is weak entity type and in order to find the address I require down I require locality as well as state as an attribute this is how we are going to represent the relationship between strong as well as weak entity type I hope you all understood regarding this entity type let me move to the next concept that is regarding entity set so till now we got to know we have entity type that we're going to specify a collection of attributes or it will going to have a set of entities with the same attribute the value of an attribute will be different but here we are going to have a entity set it is a collection of similar types of entity this will going to have a similar type of entity and here entity set is the collection of all the entities of a particular type that exist this is entity set so there we have a same kind of entity then we are making that as a group then we call that as a entity set at some moment in time that is entity instance then an entity set may contain entities with the attribute sharing a similar value remember this is just only one difference between the entity type and entity set this is also a collection of entities of a same type of a particular type if I say the student entity then only students if I say the employee entity only employee entity so here we have a entity that entity has an attribute or features or properties which are sharing similar values then that is what only the difference between the entity set as well as the type then example if student said if I say student said as an entity said that may contains all the students of a school same way if I say teacher said teachers will going to have a collection of faculties or a teacher all attributes somehow may share the similar values but if we have a different value for each attribute that is entity type there could be collection of student employee employee has a high employee ID student as a ID we have a same kind of attribute but the values are different in the entity type whenever we have a similar value for a particular attribute then we call that as a entity set and this entity set need not to be just disjoint we'll see the example here we have a two uh entity type here employee and Company and employee consists of employee one up to employee n same way company will going to have company one two company n so all entity will going to have its own attribute with values and here we have a entity set so here you can see that entity type describes the schema or intention for a set of entry days that shape the same structure so entity type specifier set of entities that share the same structure in the entity set the collection of entities of a particular entity type we are mainly focusing on a particular type then we call that as a entity grouped into an entity set and it is also called as extension of the entity type first we have a entity type and if I am taking a collection of entity type then that become entity set then we can say that as a extension this is instant intention and this is extension fine this is what the example for entity type and entity set this is one entity this is one entity type these two are the different entity type if I am taking these together then it will be a entity set I hope you all understood regarding this uh entity said let me move to the next concept that's all regarding attributes if I consider the ER model there I have an entity attribute as well as a relationship we got to know what is an entity what is entity type what is entity set now we'll start with this attribute as we all know that this is what consists of properties or features which we are using in order to identify a particular entity this is giving identification to The Entity so that the entities are represented by means of their properties then we call that properties as what attributes so these are the attributes or properties which Define The Entity type if I wanted to say the particular thing as a student then that student must have a student ID name register number age gender address like that so all whatever I'm saying will be considered as an attribute that specifies the properties or a features and then this is represented by o well so in the previous example you might have seen this we are going to use this oval symbol in order to represent an attribute and all attribute will going to have their own values if I consider a student entity that will going to have a student name class H and also they may have a student ID all those are the attribute of a student entity hi this entity is described by its attribute which are properties categorizing it with the help of this attribute we are representing the entity and each attribute will going to have its own values and each value will be going to be different from one entity to another entity and the value of attribute may be same or different so what are the different types of attribute we have here we have a simple attribute composite attribute key attribute and we have a single valued attribute multi-valued attribute and derived attributes so these are the different type of artery views that we have keep your curiosity let me meet you in the next session with the types of an attribute and also we'll see what you mean by in key attribute and also we'll see what you mean by domain of an attribute as we did for the entity set and entity type say we have a relationship type and relationship set let me meet you in the next session until that keep learning keep on growing thank you

in this video we understand what 1nf is 1 and it is basically forced normal form so there are four major normal forms 1 and F 2 n F 3 and F bcnf in this video we'll understand what the what one and F is okay it's very basic it's very easy let's understand so there are four rules for one and M for a table to be in one and F okay so these rules our first rule is single valued attributes basically atomic values basically every column okay should have atomic values okay so what it means is basically every cell should have only one one value okay now this table if you see over here it has ID name age subject this is not in 1nf form why because as you can see this cell is having two values basically ID number one it's ID one name is PQR ages 18 and an ID one has or prefer to subject DBMS on OS so this one cell is having two values it is not having atomic values so this is not in one enough so if if you want to convert this into 1 and F we will have to insert value something like this okay so the same value will be repeated again and DBMS and OS will be repeated or will be or will be written separately like this way okay I know repetition of data is happening over this is one is being repeated two times but this is the rule for one and F in the next next form that is to NF this will be removed and in something better will happen me sit in and be seen as something better will happen so this is the first major this is basically the first step to a normalized form okay so these are the rules okay the first one was to have atomic values okay and now the second rule is attribute domain should not change now what this means is basically the data type of the attribute should not change now for example the data type for ID if the data like variety is int so only int value should be over a b c or something else cannot be entered this is what rule number 2 says okay now for example there was another another attribute of your date of birth whose attribute is also data fine now if you insert some alphabets or some interval value it will not accept it that is what rule number 2 says now what is rule number 3 rule number three says unique name for attributes or columns basically each column should have some unique name okay no two columns can have same name now this is also iid and this one also says ID so there will be a confusion so basically unique names for every column should exist now rule number four is order doesn't matter it means in any order you can't write there is no no certain compulsion that ID should be over your ID can be your your anywhere so these are the four rules of 1nf okay thank you

[Music] hello friends welcome back to our channel so in today's session we'll discuss about one more concept in sql that is data types supported in sql data types in sql so in the previous session we have started the sql so that is a structured query language so there we have seen the introduction so here uh first of all let us see what is the data type and now then we'll see what are the different data types supported in this particular sql so many of you might know about these data types because if you are aware about any one of the programming language definitely you will be knowing about these data types so don't worry if you don't know about the data types so let me revise this concept once again what is the data type so here the type of value given is called as a data type so what is this type what is this right so in our computer terminology the complete data is divided into different types different types one is numeric strings okay and some images etc etc different the data can be divided in different categories different categories right in the numeric we can get it as integers that means a whole numbers so we can simply call it as whole numbers whole numbers real numbers complex numbers etc etc and similarly the strings we can call it as a characters and strings right so similarly the whole numbers here the whole numbers are represented as integers integers and real numbers are floats float values the complex is complex and the characters are a characters and this is as usual we call it as a strings right so we have seen the basic concepts of rdbms in that we have seen the concepts like entity or we can simply call it as a row or we can simply call it a tuple similarly columns so columns are attributes attributes so what we call these attributes so these attributes are the characteristics of any entity okay the characteristics of any entity we call it as attributes so definitely these attributes will hold some values holds some values and we have to define the attributes with this particular data types okay so every value will be having the type which type of data which type of data for example if you want to store the student table student table so we need to give the attributes like student id student name student percentage so let us take only these three so if you take the student id so it is just like one zero one one zero two etcetera etcetera names some abc or def etcetera etcetera and percentage seventy five point three eighty five point nine so you can see all these are whole numbers so this should be implemented by using integer so we have to represent it as an integer that means sid is an attribute which holds the numbers what is this numbers type it's an integer so integer similarly yes name so this is a group of characters we call it as a strings we call it as a strings and percentage so these are float values real numbers right so this will be represented as float right so the data type is a type of a value which is stored in an attribute attribute or variable whatever it may be so now what are the different data types that are supported in sql let us see so hope you got an idea about what is the data type what is the data right so similar to our programming language concepts so here also we are going to use the attributes and definitely while creating the table itself we have to define the attribute and we have to declare that attribute with the particular data type corresponding data right so corresponding data type means the type of value which is being stored in the attitude now now what are the different data types so data types in sql so the first one is binary data type okay i will let you know when we we are going to use this binary binary yes numeric strings date and time binary numeric strings and data and this binary is used to store the images in a database so similar to the values we can also store the images right so in order to store the images the data type is a binary okay and coming to the numeric again it is divided into two types one is approximate another one is exact that means approximate numeric data type exact numeric data approximate means again it was divided into real data types and flow to data types that means which are having some decimal points okay the attribute which will holds the value which consists of some decimal points then those attributes should be declared by using real or float so what is the difference between real and float so one difference major difference is the range of values so real will support up to one range and float will support up to one range right so exact again coming to this exact the first one is bit either zero or one next one tiny similar to our real and float there are different data types related to this exact which are differentiated with the range of values that can support right so tiny heat small inch heat big it decimal right so all these are comes under the exact exact numerator right so all our integers all are whole numbers but what is the difference means the range so bits are nothing but a zero or one tiny means to store very less number of values that means the range is very less and smaller small end is also to store the normal variable values that means the small values which are greater than tiny heat but less than integer similarly begins which can store more number of values decimal right so the main difference among all these things is the range that can support and strings again divided into character where can text so here the difference character where care and text here here also the difference is a range of characters but one difference is character means it will store the fixed size of variable that means once you fix the variable size it can't be modified okay but if you are using this where care so we can modify the size of the data type also so we have to mention the size that means how many characters that particular attribute can hold should be mentioned here so that can be modified in the background which cannot be done in the character right so for example if you want to store the student name so if you use a character data type it can hold a fixer size value so we can't change okay fixed size but if you are using some webcam you can mention the size so that we can use only that particular size for example where care of 30 so that implies so this particular attribute can hold a maximum of 30 characters as a student name so if you if the user wants to give the name which is greater than 30 that will not be accepted okay so that's the major difference between the character and the worker so text is also similar to and here the character means both the alpha numeric alpha numeric okay for example if you want to store some pan number on number so we know that a pan number will be having the alpha numeric variables alpha numeric characters okay it is a combination of digits and alphabets so if you want to use a font as an attribute so you have to declare this fund as where can so that it will accept both the alphabets and the numerical values right and the last one is a date and a time so in order to store the date as well as the time as well as a date and time so here we again it is classified into three categories so one is a date another one is a time another one is a date time date time so date means it will accept the four digit year four digit a month two sorry two digit month and two digit day okay and the time will be hours minutes seconds and coming to this day time it will accept the four digit year two digit month two digit date two digit hours two digit minutes and two digits is seconds right so this is the data date time and date so these are all the different data types available in sql okay don't get confused this is an sql so here where we are using this sql the question is where we are using this sql so this sql will be used in any one of the dbms tool okay so hope you understood so sql will be used in any one of the dbms tool what is the dbms tool so we say that bbms tool means already sql server mysql so all these are the different database tools so we are going to use this sql in one among the dbms tool so this dbms tools doesn't support all the data types okay so these data types will be different in different dbms tools now let me say the common data types which can be used in all the dbms tools so the common data types are float so if you want to store the attribute value as a real number that means a number with a decimal value so use a float so this is accepted in all the dbms tools next integer can be used as integer or number so this is a common data type which can be supported in all the dbms tools where can rarcare is also vacant and the character both are also the common data types which are used in all the dbms tools and similarly this date time date time so all these are also the common data types which are used in our dbms tools any dbm so i'll write here float integer or a number so here also we can restrict the number of digits okay next character where can where can of size so here we have to mention the size date time date so these are the common data types which can be supported by any dbms tools right but here you can observe the exact numeric data type will be having a lot of variations so this is just because of size of the variable i mean the size it supports okay similarly the float and rear also right so hope you understood about the data types i think you got an idea what is the data type and what are the different data types supported in the sql and what are the common data types which are being supported by all the dbms tools the common data types so float integer variable character date time and data so in our further sessions we are going to use these data types so while creating a table we are supposed to you give the attributes and those attributes do should be defined with the help of a corresponding data types so there we are going to use these data types while creating the table so based upon this one we have to fill the data we have to give the value to the attribute so if any value which violates this data type automatically it will not be accepted to the attribute right so hope you understood the data type supported in sql and the common data types which are supported by all the dbms tools so let's stop here and uh hope you understood this one and enjoyed the session so if you really enjoyed my session like my session share my session with your friends and if you are having any doubts regarding this one feel free to post your doubts in the comment section and don't forget to subscribe to our channel thanks for watching thank you very much

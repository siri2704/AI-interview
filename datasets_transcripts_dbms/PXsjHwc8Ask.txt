[Music] hello all welcome to Shopy as part of the Oracle database learning series We are going to learn about SQL First we require to know how the SQL can work Basically SQL is a kind of programming language It is majorly used to make interaction with the database When the user want to retrieve any information from the database related to the application the user can send the request to the DBMS So the DBMS can use a mediator like language SQL to send that corresponding query to the database and the database give the response according to the request of the user related to the application through the DBMS to the user directly So when the user want to communicate with application uh database through the application the SQL can be used So SQL is a programming language which can be used to make interaction between the user and the database per application requirements So here the SQL is simply abbreviated as structured query language It is one of the programming language In general we can use the programming language to interact with the systems like computers Here SQL is a programming language can use to interact with the database servers database softwares So which are called as the RDBMS database software Simply we can say relational database management system database servers or the database softwares So when the end user want to communicate with the RDBMS database software also called as the SQL based database software we can able to develop some instructions using the SQL The corresponding instructions which are going to be developed using the SQL called as SQL queries are also called as SQL statements So the end user can interact with the RDBMS database software using the SQL queries or the SQL statements Generally the corresponding SQL programming language is is case insensitive language That means we can write the SQL queries or SQL statements using using any case any case That means we can use the upper case or the lower case or both for the writing of the SQL queries using the SQL language that every SQL query must be terminated with the semicolon And moreover in the SQL we can able to write and develop sorry write and execute only one SQL query at a time If you want to execute the block of SQL queries based on the business requirement then we can go for the PL/SQL rather than the SQL PL/SQL simply abbreviated as procedural longways using SQL When we want to execute the block of SQL or simply we can say the block of SQL queries on the database you according to the business requirement we can use the PL/SQL If you can take If you can take the table If you can take the table here student is a table this corresponding student table is a relation that every table called as a relation and the table consisting of the colons and rows So the row colons colons are simply specified as a fields Here the corresponding relation with the fields of ID name class mark gender and the rows are simply called as a tpples are also called as a values So if suppose I want to make execute a query according to the business logic Here the business logic you can assume like I want to get the student information uh based on the student marks like if the student marks as 55 the students who are having the marks as 55 the corresponding student information I want to get display for that we can write the query like this select star select is the keyword from the SQL from is the keyword student is the table name what we have created in earlier where is the keyword and mark is the field which is having the value 55 The students who are having the values marks 55 in this given table or in this given relation all the information I want to select So by using this we can get it otherwise if you want to get all the student information we can give this corresponding query select star from student that every query in SQL must be terminate with the semicolon So this is the way that how we can able to write SQL queries to make interact with the database So here the SQL can able to execute only one query at a time If you want to execute more than one query like block of queries according to the business requirement we can go for the PL/SQL So we'll learn about the PL/SQL in our coming classes Thank you for watching about the SQL In last class we have discussed about how to interact with the Oracle database using the CLA we have seen Now in today's class we are going to discuss about how to interact with the Oracle database using the web page simply using the web URL how we can able to interact with the Oracle database we can sync for that we have an option on the desktop which is the get started with Oracle actually at the time of installation of the Oracle software where we can able to get this option into your desktop If you can double click on it we can get the page like this After that we can able to use the option called as application express Then it will ask to enter your system password So the system password I'm going to enter Actually these credentials are going to be created at the time of installation of the Oracle software only Those only I'm going to enter and click on login Then we can able to get the new prompt like this Into this corresponding prompt we have the option to create the new user Actually when you are going to work for any realtime application with the SQL there for every developer in a team there will be the number of developers So for every developer there is one there is one database user account So for my need I'm going to create my new account So create the new enter the database username For example I'm going to provide the name like the Karthik Then the corresponding username should be the application express username So I'm going to enter as same Then I'm going to provide the password I'm going to provide the password like uh something something like I'm going to give any password we can able to use Confirm password also must be same Whatever the password you have been entered the same password we can be enter here Then after entering all these details you need to click on the create workspace Then once you can be click on it you can able to get the confirmation message like uh it can it can ask successfully created workspace with Karthika to begin click here to login So we require to be click on this then you require to enter the password here I'm entering my password what I have created Then click on the login Then successfully we got the page like this Successfully we got the page like this Once we got the page then here we have the multiple options application builder SQL workshop team development administration there are many options for our purpose For example if you want to write the very first query we can able to use the SQL workshop We'll learn about all the remaining options in our coming class So here if I'm going to click on the SQL workshop I can able to get the option like this the SQL commands object browser SQL scripts query builder utilities like that So here I want to write the SQL query So for that only I'm going to use the SQL commands and here I'm going to type my command like select start from select start from all underscore users all users if you can be give this corresponding command all underscore users then click on the semicolon that every query must be end with the semicolon So after entering this if you can be click on the run we can get all the table information all the table information here we have the option So here rows is the option we have if you want to select the means if you want to increase the number of rows actually this uh selected with the 10 by default if you can be increase the size so we can able to get 20 rs 20 rows if I'm going to click on the run so if you have the data so the data can be displayed with the 20 rows so according to your number of rows which you have been selected here that that many number of rows with the table can be displayed okay then here we have in In the SQL workshop only we have one more option That option is what instance object browser SQL commands is the option we can use for typing any query what you need for the SQL to work And uh if you if you want to know some other options then we have the option like object browser So this object browser having the lot of objects So what kind of objects we have like tables views indexes sequences types packages procedures functions triggers database links uh materialized views and synonyms These are all the options These are all the options which can help to uh create any database object using the graphical objects So these are all the graphical objects So we can able to create any database object So for example if I'm going to click on the EMP I can get the EMP table EMP table template Okay So if you can be click on the data the corresponding table data can be displayed So by using these objects we can able to create our own table when we require Okay So this is the way that how we can able to be how we can able to be interact with the Oracle database using the using the URL using the web page web page of the Oracle database whatever it is or web URL of the Oracle database as part of Oracle database learning sequence tutorial We have covered about how to interact with the database using the CLA and how to interact with the database using the web app or the web URL We have seen there is one more way that that also we can use in the real time So it's called as how to interact with the database using the graphical user interface or simply we can say the GUI tools So actually in the real time to work with or to connect with the Oracle database We have the different JIO tools One is Oracle SQL developer and second one is the code for Oracle So these are the two popular tools GI tools when we need to use to interact with the Oracle database One is the Oracle SQL developer and another one is a tool for Oracle developer or Oracle database So here I'm going to tell you that how we can able to use Oracle SQL developer So if you want to use the Oracle SQL developer for interacting with the Oracle database first you should be download that Oracle SQL developer So go to Oracle official website by simply by simply um using the option like this Oracle SQL developer download Oracle SQL developer download by using this corresponding option you can able to get the page like this so if you can get on we have the multiple options here so generally the Oracle software is always be on top of the Java so simply we can JDK so it is better to go for this corresponding option Windows 64bit with JDK 17 but this corresponding option you can choose depending upon your operating system your system configuration If your system is with Windows you can use this option If your system with Mac you can use this option If your system with the Linux you can use the corresponding option like Linux RPM So like that according to your system configuration you can choose So my system configuration is this So I'm going to download this So once the downloading is completed the file look like this If you can go to the downloads the file can be look like this It's a GIF file The file can be get download in the GIF file format So you should be extract this file So by simply right click on the corresponding folder you can get the option extract all If you can use this option you can able to extract So the corresponding extracted file like this SQL developer So this is my this is my folder what I have been extracted SQL developer So after open the corresponding folder if you can get down we have an option we have an option which is called as a SQL developer.exe by double click on it so it will it will start the SQL developer can start So now once the SQL developer can start you can able to open the page like this So there is a welcome page it will take some time to load This is the welcome page and not important for us I'm just going to close this and you have the two navigations here and the two sections are here in this one is the connections and another one is the reports Okay So here what are the connections we have created how many users are getting working on this corresponding area to understand all those we can able to check with this connections here So to work means whatever the query you are going to write after running after running that corresponding query the report can able to be get it here So we'll see about all the corresponding things So first of all if you want to work with this corresponding um Oracle SQL developer first you need to be click on this plus symbol for creating the new account If you are using this corresponding SQL developer for the first time you can able to click on this plus symbol for adding the new connection So now now what I'm going to do I'm going to give database database developer database developer ravi this is the new name I'm going to be provided and this is completely uh user defined so whatever the way you want you can be okay and I'm going to select one option uh let's suppose I'm going to choose the option like the green color I'm selecting selecting the green green and then I'm going to provide the username like the ravi And the password I used to define something like here Then after that click on the save password This option can help you to save the password No instead instead to add the corresponding password manually again and again If you can be click on the save password it can able to open it can able to open when when you need to be correct it can automatically open without entering of the password manually Then after that here if you can be observe the host name can be with local host That means we are running the Oracle SQL developer in our local computer So the host name is the local host and the port number is the 1521 and SID is the XC So do not change not required to be changed on you can require to simply click on the test test then then so once the test connection is completed then you can click on the connector So now see the database developer RVI got created The database developer Ravi got created Okay So now for that there is a new worksheet is going to be opened automatically Okay here whatever the query you want to enter you can For example I'm going to give a query like select SIS date Select SIS date from Jul If you want to get if you want to get the today's date or the current date you can able to use this corresponding query and then if you can click on this corresponding option run option then you have to get today's date is it like this we can able to use any any query here For example if you want to enter uh the data like this select select star from from emp table from means uh the emp table I want to make it open So if I'm going to click on it the EM table can be EM table can be at the same time if I'm going to use a command like select star from tapa select star from tap department so if I'm going to run this program then we can able to get the department so like this like this we can able to use the SQL developer to interact with the Oracle database so here here the corresponding GUI having some GUI options to create or to interact with the database for creation of the objects of any like table object if you want view object if you want any object we can able to be create using the GI options or the GUI objects So what are those for example if you can be click on it so all the objects are going to be listed here see tables views indexes packages like all the options are going to be listed here by using all these corresponding options we can able to be interact with the database according to our requirement So this is the way how we can able to be interact with the database using the GUI So till now we have studied that how we can able to be connect with the database mean there are the three ways we have used till now So one is the using CLA command line interface using web web or the web application using the GUI graphical user interface So among this whatever you want you can be so most we can able to use in the real time we can able to use with the uh GUI So using the connection and interaction with the database using the GI winding as part of Oracle learning tutorial we have discussed about how to install the Oracle database software into a system and then we have discussed about how to make interact with the Oracle database software using the different approaches The different approaches are here using command line interface using the web application using the GUI graphical user interface that how we can able to make interact with the Oracle database software We have seen as part of this we have understood that how we can able to be create the account user database account user like that means at the time of Oracle software installation we have provided some login details like username and password those details are called as system details technically those are also called as DBA details DBA account details means database admin account details And after that at the time of web application means when you have interacted with the Oracle database using the web application by that time we have created some users like Anil Ravi like that we have been created some users So we have some clarity that how we can able to be create the accounts using the Oracle database software by following the different approaches we have seen But sometimes the interviewer might ask is it possible to create the new database account user using the CLA means yes we can do it So how we can able to be create the new database account user using the CLA approach we can see now So when you want to create the new database account user first of all we require to be start with the SQL command line or SQL command line interface So how we can able to be start means just go to search bar and type the SQL here you have the option called as run SQL command line then click on it You have the command line interface which is technically called as SQL startless after open or after starting of the SQL command line then you require to give connect command connect command then enter it can ask the username So as part of this we require to provide the DBA details DBA account details means database admin account details like username and password So the database admin account details the username is the system and the password is the system what I have been provided at the time of Oracle software installation I'm going to use those then I got the status like system got connected that means I have successfully connected with my DBA details DBA account details using these details I want to create the new account user new database account user but before going to create First we require to be check whether we have successfully connected with the DBA account or not For that we require to use a command called as show user semicolon So here the command is nothing but SQL query So after every SQL query we require to be keep the semicolon for the termination So that only I'm going to be follow here Once you have been given the show space user then keep enter you have to be get the output as user is system that means we were successfully got connected with the DBA account using this DBA account we required to be create the new database account user how we can be so very simple we require to be use one more SQL command or the query which is create space So that means we are passing the request to the database Oracle database So what I want to make create the new account user new database account user So for that only create create is a command I'm using space what I want to create new user I want to create So user I'm going to provide So after this with what name you want to create the new account that we require to be provided So for example I want to create the new account with the name of Rakkesh So I'm using Rakkesh space at the time of login the username must be required with or connected with or referred with password So the corresponding username with what password with which password need to be identified that password also will require to be provided So how we can be instance by using a res word called as identified by we require to provide the password here done then keep the semicolon every SQL command or SQL query must be terminated with the semicolon so I'm using that then enter now see user got created so once we have created the user we need to be provide the grant or we need to be provide the permission permission why here the permission Means when the user have been user account have been created this user account need to be create or use the database objects like tables views indexes etc So when the corresponding database account user want to deal with or work with the database objects we need the corresponding account user need the permission So we need to be provide here How we can able to be provide the pro permission space using a command called as a grant grant space resource That means we are specifying the corresponding resources What exactly required to utilize the Oracle database objects properly Okay All we need to be make it grant right So grant space resource along with the resource granting we require to be specify that I want to connect also So that is the reason I'm using the connect here grant space resource comma connect to whom we are going to be provide the grant So definitely the user right So the username we require to be provided using the two we require to be provide the username here Then keep the semicolon Done Then enter the button Now you got the confirmation message that like grant succeed So that means we have we have the successful permissions So once that you have the permission you can able to be create any database object like tables Now we need to be check whether we have successfully connected with the username Rakkesh or not So for that only again I'm using show user command Still I got the message like system that means I have connected with the DBA account details only not with the database new user account If you really want to connect with the database new user account then you require to be give again connect command then it can ask the username Now I'm going to provide Rakkesh is the username password again be providing here then it was connected after successfully connection you require to be use the same command show user Now you have the confirmation that whether you are connecting with the new database account user or not So this is the way that how we can able to be create the new database account user using the DBA credentials So once you have created once you have created the new database account user if you want to delete it we can do it So how we can able to be delete the corresponding created user account credentials Database account user credentials means simple again you need to be connect with the system here from the user means from the database user account you cannot able to be delete any account the corresponding accounts are going to be created through the DBA through the DBA means database admin so that is the reason again I'm using the correct now I'm providing DBA details system as the username system as the password Enter I got successfully connected into my DBA account Now I need to be use a command called as drop drop space drop space user which user I want to drop it which user I want to drop it For example I have a user called as a Rajes I want to drop it So user drop again I want to drop the Rakkesh So I'm using drop space user space done So all the users got dropped So like this if you want to delete any user we required to be use the drop um drop command By using the drop command we can able to be delete the corresponding created database account user learning tutorial series We are going to learn introduction to SQL in today's session So first what is the SQL So simple when the users want to interact together they need to use the languages Those languages are called as the natural languages like Telugu English Hindi etc Using those kind of the languages two users can able to or more than two users can able to interact When a user want to interact with the system or the computer we need a programming language So same here the SQL is one of the programming language which can be used by the end user to make interact with the database So that is the reason the SQL is going to be called as database query language or database programming language So SQL is abbreviated as structured query language As a end user when we need to be interact with the database that means when we want to pass some statements to make execute in the database software we require to be create some statements We require to be create some queries or we require to be create some commands For that we need to be use the special programming language called as SQL Here basically here the SQL statements or SQL queries look like the normal English statements And moreover the SQL queries are case insensitive That means if you can write the query in lower case or upper case or in any case can able to be accepted by the database software and the corresponding SQL queries are going to be developed by following the ANC standards American national standard code information for interchange The corresponding SQL query what we are using to make interact with the database must be terminated with the semicolon How the Java programming language can be ended with the semicolon Here the SQL query or the SQL statement can always be terminated with the semicolon Actually the SQL we can use to interact with the database Here the SQL can able to make execute only one query at a time But sometimes according to the business requirements we may require to execute block of queries or the block of statements in the database software like Oracle So in that scenario SQL is not suitable We can able to be use the PL/SQL means procedural language using SQL the PL/SQL can able to be make it execute more than one statement on the database software So that is the basic difference between the SQL and PL/SQL Then we require to know the SQL commands The SQL programming language following the ANC standards The ANC standards describe some commands to make work with the SQL as part of the interaction with the database software like Oracle So there are five types of SQL commands are available One is DDL commands means data definition language commands DML commands means data manipulation language commands DCL commands means data control language commands DRL commands means data retrieval language commands and TCL commands means transaction control language commands So total five types of commands are there Now we required to know the importance of all these five command five types of commands Actually the all these five types of commands are very common for any RDBMS database software like for the MySQL for the DB2 for any kind of in any kind of postdql for any kind of the RDBMS database software all these five types of commands are common So what is meant by the data definition language command Generally the data definition language commands or DDL commands can deal with structure of the database object As you already know database objects like tables views indexes etc So the DDL commands are always be based on the structure of the database object That means if you really want to create the new database object or if you want to modify the database object or if you want to delete we required to be use the DDL commands means data definition language commands So the available DDL commands are create alter drop truncate etc By using this we can able to be create the database object we can able to be modify we can able to be delete etc The DML commands can deal with the data of the database object The whatever the database object we can be create using the DDL command The corresponding data object other database object can deal with the data right to make deal we required the DML commands DML data manipulation longway commands So to manipulate the data the man to manipulate with the data of the database object there are some commands are available those are like insert update delete etc Next DCL commands means database sorry data control logic commands can deal with permissions permissions to give or permissions to revoke for the database users So when the database user can be get created by using the DBA account by using the DBA account credentials we require to be provide the permissions to make create the or to make handle the or to make deal with the database objects So to give the permissions or to cancel the permissions we need some commands Those commands only be called as DCL commands data control longways commands So the available DCL commands are grant revoke all these kind of the commands can be used by the DB users only The next one DRL commands data retrieval language commands can deals with the retrieving the data from the database objects So the corresponding DRL command is only one that is a select Next TCL commands transaction control longway commands can deal with the transaction management When you are going to be use the application any web application using the web application you can do some actions like login and for example if you can take the IRCT application only if you really book a ticket if you want to book a ticket first you need to do login with the IRCTC then you require to be enter your credentials like from address to address from where to where you want to do the uh traveling So the corresponding credentials date we required to be provided how many tickets you want to book So all the information we require to be provided once you have been selected the train and everything when you are going to be do the payment all the corresponding information or the history enabled to be inside the database right So here from the login onwards till the log out whatever the action whatever the performance you are going to be do you are going to be performed okay all those are going to be handled maintained for that only to deal with that only we required some commands so those are only be called as the TCL commands so the TCL commands are like commit roll back etc So these are the five different types of the SQL commands what we have So we require to be know about all these corresponding commands how to use and everything in dep in depth in our coming classes So there we can be discuss more about these corresponding commands is SQL compiler based or interpreter based issql compiler based or interpreter based So compiler and interpreter those are the two translators what we have for the highle programming languages When the highle programming language script or snippets want to translate into mission readable format like ones and zeros we need the compiler and interpreter So SQL is also consisting of highlevel understandable quotes like using the user understandable words and the sentences we are writing the queries using the SQL to make communicate with the database So for the SQL also we need either compiler or interpreter But here SQL is interpreter based SQL is interpreter based programming language So how means the SQL is a declarative language It is a declarative language majorly used for managing and querying that databases It doesn't follow the traditional compilation process like C C++ Java where the code is compiled into the machine level language before the execution The corresponding SQL statements are interpreted by the database management system So when the user able to transfer a query to the DBMS database management system the DBMS can interpret the query what we have been sent for managing or for storing whatever whatever the management thing you want to do at the database So the corresponding statement or the query can able to be interpreted by the DBMS before going to be execute That means after the after the uh processing of the SQL query dynamically the corresponding statement can be executed directly in the DBMS When SQL query is executed the query processor within the DBMS parses it can parse the statement optimize the statement and uh it can able to be interpret the statement So these are the three steps what the corresponding query processor can do in the DBMS So this is the way we can say the SQL is compiler based or interpreter based means it is purely the interpreter based Moreover the SQL can able to make send only one query at a time That is the reason also we can say the SQL is the interpreter based language How SQL execution process works When we have the SQL query for creation of any database object like for example we have the syntax like this create table for example employee table we are creating in this the employee ID employee ID is the uh type of tiny in type of tiny enter comma employee name is a type of vare w care of size of 40 So like this when you have the uh database object Okay So for the creation of the database object I have been followed this corresponding query right So when we have the query for doing any activity in the database table Okay So how this corresponding query can work that we need to know So for this only for this only there is a flow So this corresponding SQL query what we can be create for working with the database for working with any database object Okay This corresponding query can be provided to the parser or the translator by the query processor the parser or the uh translator can able to receive the query from the query processor and checks for the syntax errors and verifies whether the query is valid or not Once it is valid and then it can be transmit to the optimizer Optimizer for doing the optimization that means the database optimizer analyzes the different ways to execute the query efficiently It considers the indexes join or the join strategies and available statistics etc And finally it can generates the plan for the execution So once the corresponding optimizer generates the plan to be execute that can be provided Simply we can say this is consisting of the catalog of the database to make execute the code So once it can be generate the corresponding catalog transmit to the interpreter which is only be called as execution engine and can process with the data to give you the output So this is the way how the SQL query execution process can takes place So in general in SQL we can able to be deal with the most important data formats There are three most important data formats One is the number format Second one is the text format Third one is the date time format So total three different SQL data formats we have These three are most important data formats in SQL when we want to be interact with the database servers like MySQL or Oracle So number format data types when we want to be send or define the colon of the table with the number type we can able to be use or we can able to be follow four different types of the data four different types of the data types So one is the tiny int Second one is the small int Third one is the int Fourth one is the big in So total four different types of datas we have under the number format So actually the number format data types are majorly classified into two So one is the integral types two types the major classification one is the integral type integral type or the number type simply we can say second one is the floating point type or the fractional type or the floating point type So the corresponding integral type can be classified into four types There are the four types of integral types we have integral data we have So one is the tiny int second one is a small int Third one is the big sorry int and finally begin So tiny int can able to reserve with the one by of memory and allow to store the values from minus 128 to + 127 This is the maximum range The integral part can allow to store the value both negative and positive So here the range of value for the tiny int is the minus 128 to + 127 So how we can we get it means there is a formula So for example when we have the n number of bits the n number of bits by using the n number of bits how many values we can able to store means two power of n minus sorry two power of n values we can be stored When we have the n number of bits we can able to store two power of n values These two power of n values can be ranged It can be ranges from -2 power of n -1 to - 2^ n -1 to + 2 power of n - 1 + 2^ of n -1 - 1 This is the formula what we have to understand the range So for example here the n is 8 n is the 8 Then for this the range is going to be considered as the -2 power of 8 - 1 means 7 to + 2^ 7 - 1 This is the range So this can even only be write like - 128 to + 127 This is a point So this is the range for the tiny int Similarly when you want to define the colon type as the small int which holds the memory as the two bytes and can to take the values from minus two power of 2 bytes means 2 into 8 16 So -2 power of 16 - 1 means 15 to + 2 power of 15 - 1 This is the range for the small int and integer can hold four bytes of memory which can allow to store the values from minus2 power of 4 bytes means 32 So 32 - 1 31 to + 2 power of 31 - 1 This is the range and coming to the beginning it holds the eight bytes of memory So can store can take the value range is from -2 power of 63 to + 2^ of 63 minus one This is the range for the beginner So like this when we want to define the data in integral format the number which is not having any decimal point in between such type of the numbers are what called as integral So those integrals can able to be represented in the four ways For example when we have the table so like for example create table object with the name of employee So the corresponding employee have employee ID Employee ID can able to be represented with the type as small in small enter Next employee name sorry not not employee name So for example if you want to be take employee is the employee is can able to be defined with the tiny int then if the user want to define its address using the pin code the pin can able to be take with the integer type and the mobile number able to define with the begin So like this according to the requirement we can able to be create the table and its corresponding columns So this is about the integral data types We have learned about the inteious in last class How we can able to be represent the integral forms or integral types of the data in last class So in today we can go with the fractional values or simply we can say fractional type Fractional type How we can able to be represent the fractional type Fractional type means when a number with the decimal point when a number with the decimal point are coming under the fractional point fractional values So in SQL there are three ways to represent the fractional type values One is the float Second one is the double Third one is the decimal So total three types are there So float is simply representing when a fractional value when a fractional value can take can take up to 16 decimal places or 16 places up to 16 places before and after the decimal point Before and after the decimal point Okay then we can use then we can use float So for example uh float means the salary is the foreign of the employee table So this can be represented with a float means we can able to take a value for the salary as salary equals to like for example 23,456.79 like this we can be we can be so before and after the decimal point we can able to keep the maximum of 16 decimal places 16 places 16 places okay such a type of the representation coming into the float now the double when a fraction value When a fractional value can take up to 32 places before before and after the decimal point after the decimal point we can use double we can use double So for example um account balance account balance is one of the colon for the bank application Okay So our bank application means here the bank table simply we can say if it is going to be take the double means okay double means we can able to create the account balance We can able to be create the account balance with the value like up to 32 places Okay So it can be like 1 cr 23 lakh 4,456 897 like this So like this if you want to define the two largest value again we go with the double type Okay So this is the basic difference between the float and double Then what is the decimal means Decimal is same as look double same as double but only the difference is double can be considered can be considered per approximation can be considered for the approximation approximation means yeah for example when we can be consider 10.9 so if the approximate value nearer value for this is 11 11 if you have a number like 10.12 the nearest value for this is a 10 So this is the meaning of approximation So we can able to be applied for the float and double but but for the decimal for the decimal we cannot allow to do we cannot allow to do the approximation So this is the basic difference between the double and decimal So these are the three floating point values or the fractional type of the data what we have in SQL In last class we have studied about fractional data types Now in today's class we can go with the text type or the text format So we have already studied the SQL data formats are three numerical format text format and then date time format So till now we have been worked with number format number number are the numerical format So now we can be start with the text format Text can allow to be defined with either single quote or double quote So there are three different types of the text formatted data One is cat type Second one is where cat type Third one is the text type or the string type hair type where cat type and text type So here the cat type or the vat type almost same these are look like same here So when you can able to be define or when you want to define the text or the stringer we using the cap we can follow the syntax like this the colon name space the care type care of we need to be specify the size we need to be specify the size here the size is positive here the size must be positive means above zero we can be considered simply we can say so here how the corresponding cat type is going will be work means so for example we have we have the employee name in the employee table employee name is the colon name okay so for this the cat type I'm taking care type of the ty so this is the declaration for one of the colon so in this case what happens for the employee name for the employee name the corresponding SQL processor can create the corresponding SQL processor can create the total of 30 bytes of memory 30 bytes of memory Even if you have the employee name with four characters like the Ravi you might have means in your table for the colon employee name there is a value ra which holds only the four characters So each character holds the one one by Okay So actually the original size at the time of creation of the colon employee name given as a 30 right So according to the size the total total can be created as a 30 only into this 30 the total four bytes of memory can be write and the remaining 26 bytes of the data can be um wasted Whereas in the case of the vcar the syntax can be look like this So we can define the colon name with the vare we are defining vare with the size here also the size should be positive that means greater than zero So when you have the employee name with the vare of with the vare of 30 So in this case what happen in sense but suppose if we have the employee name as the ravi whatever the size you have been provided whatever the size you are trying to be stored into the table employee table So here here it cannot bother about the corresponding size according to the value that means for the employee name here we have the four characters Now only four bytes of memory can be created Four bytes of memory can be created According to the value the corresponding memory can be created by the vap But carry is not like that According to the size what you have been specified at the time of declaration of the column according to the corresponding size the total memory can be created into that the value can be stored But in the case of the vare according to the value the memory can be created It doesn't bother about the size what you are going to be specify at the time of the declaration of the column name So when you are going to be compare the care and vare care can take less time care can take less time per the modification where care can take little uh more time than comparing with the cap because care can have already 30 bytes up to 30 it can able to take the characters with any but where according to the update for example I'm going to be do in the place of ravi I may add five more characters then For these six characters space + five for these six characters new six bytes of memory need to be created and stored So that is the reason slightly more time can consume for the vare than comparing with the care So this is the performance issue what we have comparing with the care and vare So next text type text type So when you want to create the memory or when you want to store the data with the huge amount of the text huge amount of the text like in terms of the paras more than 256 256 characters more than 256 characters if you want to store as a data then we can go for the text type of the data So this is the uh text type of the data So these are the three text formatted data types what we have care var and text we have discussed about number type of the data Next text format of the data So now in today's class we can go for the date and time formats So generally we can able to create the column of the table using date and time So there are the three types of the date and time formatted data One is date type Second one is the time type Third one is the date time typer So total three types are there So date type can allow to be defined using the date format within the single quotes The date format like year- month So this is the format for the date type For example today's date is the 2025 iPhone 02 is the February iPhone date is the 24 So like this the date type of the data we can able to be create Next time time type the time as like the date type can able to be defined with the quotes So it is having the format like hour colon minute colon second This is the time format what we have So if you want to store or represent the colon with the time format we can go for the value like this So for example 17 hearts 04 minutes 44 seconds So like this if you want to define or represent the column type of the data in the time type we can go for the um time then date time So it can allow to represent the time uh value of the column in both date and time So the date can include year month date Then space the time can be half minute seconds This is the format of the date time So for example so today's date is 2025 - 0 to 24 space 07 col 05 colon 55 seconds So like this the date time can be represented So to deal with the date we can able to be use the date type of the data time type and date time type In last class we have discussed about the date time format Now we can go for the binary format or the binary data type Simply we can say the binary format of the data So binary binary is simply considered as to use to store the binary data Binary format data can be used to store the binary data Binary data means images files or non-extual information etc Okay So when we need to deal with the when we need to deal with the binary information like binary information like images um files and um non-exted format of the data nonextual information simply we can say non-extual information okay we can use simply binary formats So in SQL there are the um three binary formatted data What we have there are the total three binary formatted data or not three there are there are two binary formatted data or there are two binary types we have there are two binary representations we have So one is binary Second one is where binary So binary can store can store fixed length of binary data The corresponding size must be specified when defining the colon The corresponding size must be specified Whereas the where binary it can store the variable length of binary data The colon can hold up to maximum of or up to maximum size maximum size defined So this is the meaning of the where binary So here how we can able to be represent the binary type of the data and where binary type type of the data means So very simple if you can take the example here Let's take the example So for suppose we have create table create table with the files with the files Okay So in this I have the information which is called as a file type file type which can hold the binary of 16 which can hold the binary of 16 So that means the corresponding files can able to create the object called as the file with the size of 16 bytes That is the meaning of it The corresponding file data can able to be stored with the size of 16 bytes or 64 bytes whatever it is according to our requirement Okay So this is the meaning of it So whereas coming to the where binary where binary so here if suppose we have a object database object called as a table with the name files with the name files here we are having the file ID as integer file ID as the integer Next the file data the file data which is going to be defined with the v binary with the size of 512 So which is going to be defined uh the maximum size Okay So when you want to define the files with the more size like 512 bytes or more than that then we can go for the van where binary So this is the way that how we can able to be differentiate the binary and where binary So these are the two binary format of the data what we have in SQL We are going to learn about DDL commands in today's session So we have already discussed in earlier only SQL provided the five different types of commands to make interact with the Oracle database software One is the DDL commands DML commands DCL commands DRL commands and TCL commands So in today's session one of the command like DDL commands we can be learn So actually SQL providing the four important DDL commands for interacting with the for the creation of the structure of the database object any database object like table or view or storage procedure or function for creation of any for creation of any uh structure of the database object we can able to go for the DDL commands So for that only there are the four DDL commands are available One is create Second one is alter Third one is prop Fourth one is truncate So total four different types of commands we have So first we need to know about the creator So when we want to create any database object So to create any database object like table view etc we can able to use the create command So here if suppose you want to create the table only using the create command then we can able to use the syntax like this create table the name of the table For example I want to provide the name of the table like the employee table employee table Then open the parenthesis and keep the semicolon In between this the columns we can be provided in between this the columns For example I need to be provide like employee ID So the employee ID is integer type Next I want to provide the employee name This is the car type which holds the 50 characters maximum So like this if I want to be create the table with the different fields what are all the different fields I want for each different field the name and the type we need to be keep So this is the structure what we need to be follow So like this if you want to create any database object we can use the create table So I want to show you that how we can able to be create the table using the create command practically So we have the Oracle database software in our computer we can able to be interact with the Oracle database software using three ways using CLA using the web application using the GUI So now I'm going to use the web application to create the database So let's open the web application of Oracle database software Then after that you can able to open means click on express sorry application express then you require to be logged with the admin details Admin details are here system then click on login then if you have the user you can able to be click on the login if you are not having the user you can able to be create the user here we have already discussed the entire criteria so here I'm going to be click on the login and I'm going to be use some other name like I want to take uh something like anil I want to use anal here to do the login so done so have been logged in with the Anil Okay Now I want to create the table using the create command For that I'm clicking on the SQL workshop Go to the SQL commands and provide create create table create table employee employee table Employee table start with the parentheses close with the parentheses and keep the semicolon Then here we require to be provide employee ID emp which is the integer type I'm taking Next employee name which is the care type which holds which holds of 50 characters So like this I want to create the table with only the two fields Let's run the code Now table got created successfully So once the table can be created we can able to be use the table to assign any value or if you want to add the new column anything we can able to be do So this is the way that how we can able to use the create command for our creation of any database object using the database software Next Now once we have created the table to perform changes on the created structure like for example if you want to add the new colon into the created table or if you want to change the table name or if you want to change the type of the data So if you want to perform any changes on the structure what we have been created using the create command we can use the alter command Alter So to modify the created structure to modify the created structure using using create command to create a uh to modify the created structure we can use we can use alter command We can use the alter command So if you suppose I want to add I want to add the new element for example I want to add the new colon into this table employee table okay so this is my employee table I'm going to use this only I'm going to use this only so for that alter table table the table name table name space for example I want to add uh designation I want to add the designation designation which is the car type which is the car type care of suppose I want to take the 40 characters maximum So here I want to perform the adding order on the table now So after the table name like employee table we require to use a keyword called as add then we can able to be perform the alter or change on the given table successfully So like this if you want to perform any changes on the table we can able to use the alter command So on the any changes on the table means on the created structure if you want to perform any changes we can go for the alter So this is the simple syntax what we can be used for the alter next drop So when you want to delete any created structure permanently once we can be deleted no modification and no adding no altering we can be performed So in that scenario we can use the drop It can delete the data along with the structure of the table or along with the structure of the database object can be deleted permanently Then we can go for the drop It can delete the database object permanently It can delete the database object permanently We can go with the drop command So for example here we can able to use drop If I'm going to be use the drop I want to perform the table on the table I want to perform the drop drop table employee employee table we have space employee table that's it so if I'm going to be given like this run the table got dropped so once I have performed the prop on the table we cannot able to be perform any modification like for example if I'm going to be define again this alter option or alter operation on this drop table I can be definitely get the error so I can get the error that is table or view does not exist So this is the point that means when you can able to be use the drop it can able to be delete it can able to be delete the corresponding table permanently we can we cannot able to be retrieve it back for performing any alter operations Okay so that is the meaning of the drop So next truncate So the truncate is same as the drop The truncate can clear all the fields all the fields of the table by keeping by keeping the table structure by keeping the table structure That means after the truncate after the truncate we can able to be perform the alter operation for example this is my table what I have for example I have the table like this I'm going to be use this corresponding table let's let's run it table got created okay so after the creation of the table if I'm going to be perform the trate operation trunate table space employee table then run it the table got truncated After this if I'm going to be perform any alter operation so if I'm going to be perform any alter operation say it can perform the corresponding modification on the table can be takes place so drop cannot perform any operation back once you can able to be implement the drop command means we cannot be perform any alterations on the corresponding table Okay truncate is not like that because the truncate can clear all the elements by making the table as empty or the object as empty That's it When you can able to be perform the alter it can able to be add the element in that corresponding table place So that is the basic difference between the truncate and so we have already discussed in earlier only SQL provided the five different types of commands to make interact with the Oracle database software one is the DDL commands DML commands DCL commands DRL commands and TCL commands So in today's session one of the command like DDL commands we can be learn So actually SQL providing the four important DDL commands for interacting with the database software for the creation of the structure of the database object Any database object like table or view or storage procedure or function for creation of any uh structure of the database object we can able go for the DDL commands So for that only there are the four

parentheses and keep the semicolon in between this the columns we can be provided in between this the columns for example I need to be provide like employee ID So the employee ID is integer type Next I want to provide the employee name This is the car type which holds the 50 characters maximum So like this if I want to be create the table with the different fields What are all the different fields I want for each different field the name and the type we need to be keep So this is the structure what we need to be follow So like this if you want to create any database object we can use the create table So I want to show you that how we can able to be create the table using the create command practically So we have the Oracle database software in our computer We can able to be interact with the Oracle database software using three ways using CLA using the web application using the GUI So now I'm going to use the web application to create the database So let's open the web application of Oracle database software Then after that you can able to open means click on express sorry application express then you require to be login with the admin details Admin details are here system then click on login Then if you have the user you can able to be click on the login If you are not having the user you can able to be create the user Here we have already discussed the entire criteria So here I'm going to be click on the login and I'm going to be use some other name like I want to take uh something like anil I want to use Anil here to do the login So done So I have been logged in with the Anil Okay Now I want to create the table using the create command For that I'm clicking on the SQL workshop Go to the SQL commands and provide create create table create table Employee employee table employee table start with the parentheses close with the parentheses and keep the semicolon Then here we require to be provide employee ID emp which is the integer type I'm taking Next employee name which is the care type which holds which holds of 50 characters So like this I want to create the table with only the two fields Let's run the code Now table got created successfully So once the table can be created we can able to be use the table to assign any value or if you want to add the new column anything we can able to be do So this is the way that how we can able to use the create command for our creation of any database object using the database software Next once we have created the table to perform changes on the created structure like for example if you want to add the new colon into the created table or if you want to change the table name or if you want to change the type of the data So if you want to perform any changes on the structure what we have been created using the create command we can use the alter command alter So to modify the created structure to modify the created structure using using create command So to create a uh to modify the created structure we can use we can use alter command We can use the alter command So if you suppose I want to add I want to add the new element For example I want to add the new colon into this table Employee table Okay So this is my employee table I'm going to use this only I'm going to use this only So for that alter table table the table name table name space For example I want to add uh designation I want to add the designation Designation which is the car type which is the car type care of Suppose I want to take the 40 characters maximum So here I want to perform the adding order on the table So after the table name like employee table we require to use a keyword called as add then we can able to be perform the alter or change on the given table successfully So like this if you want to perform any changes on the table we can able to use the alter command So on the any changes on the table means on the created structure if you want to perform any changes we can go for the alter So this is the simple syntax what we can be used for the alter Next drop So when you want to delete any created structure permanently once we can be deleted no modification and no adding no altering we can be performed So in that scenario we can use the drop It can delete the data along with the structure of the table or along with the structure of the database object can be deleted permanently Then we can go for the drop It can delete the database object permanently It can delete the database object permanently We can go with the drop command So for example here we can able to use drop If I'm going to be use the drop I want to perform the table on the table I want to perform the drop drop table employee employee table we have space employee table that's it so if I'm going to be given like this run the table got dropped so once I have performed the drop on the table we cannot able to be perform any modification like for example if I'm going to be define again this alter option or alter operation on this drop table I can be definitely get the error So I can get the error that is table or view does not exist So this is the point that means when you can able to be use the drop it can able to be delete it can able to be delete the corresponding table permanently we can we cannot able to be retrieve it back for performing any alter operations Okay So that is the meaning of the drop So next truncate So the truncate is same as the drop same same as the drop But the trunket can clear all the fields all the fields of the table by keeping by keeping the table structure by keeping the table structure that means after the truncate after the truncate we can able to be perform the alter operation for example this is my table what I have for example I have the table like this I'm going to be use this corresponding table let's Let's run it Table got created Okay So after the creation of the table if I'm going to be perform the truncate operation truncate truncate table space employee table then run it The table got truncated After this if I'm going to be perform any alter operation if I'm going to be perform any alter operation it can work So if I'm going to be perform any alter operation so it can perform the corresponding modification on the table can be takes place So drop cannot cannot perform any operation back once you can able to be implement the drop command means we cannot be perform any alterations on the corresponding table Okay Truncate is not like that because the truncate can clear all the elements by making the table as empty or the object as empty That's it when you can able to be perform the alter it can able to be add the element in that corresponding table place So that is the basic difference between the trunk and we are going to be learn about to write the query that query describing like creating the customer table and inserting the data into the table and display that corresponding table after insertion So how these three steps we can do we'll see now So when we want to create the table into the database we can able to use one of the DDL command one of the DDL command which is called as the create using the create command we can able to be create the table So the syntax for the create command is create table is the object name which is going to be used as a keyword in the SQL query space The table name whatever the table name we want to be provided the table name we can be give then start the parentheses in between the parentheses the column name column number one the corresponding data type data type also we require to be specified then column number two the column name number two space data type like just how many columns we require that many number of columns we need to be placed this is the syntax we need to be used when we want to be create the table into the database So here to understand I'm going to be implementing the SQL command line So I'm starting the SQL command line here and when you have started first command we required to be that is the connect Now I'm using system as a username and a password Now I have connected into the database successfully and I'm using one more command called as a show user Now I have means the system admin got connected into the database successfully with the corresponding username is shown as the system Now I want to create the table So to create the table we can use the create command create space the table is the database object which is act as a keyboard space the table name I'm using like customer customer table or else customer table demo this is my table name enter now you require to be provide the corresponding column names for example I want to provide the c is the column name which is the number type comma name of the customer which is the vare of 50 I want to create the name of the customer with the maximum size of 50 and uh for every customer there is a gender Gender is also we take the maximum size of 40 and uh as I want to keep which is the number type and then location location is of again vap which is of the maximum size of 50 So like this we require to be create the table So we have created the table successfully So once you have created the table we need to validate or check whether table structure got created or not Table structure got created or not So how in sense So by using the query by using a query which is called as a describer describe So the corresponding table name we should be that's it by using this corresponding syntax we can able to understand whether the table structure got successfully created into the database table or not So I'm using here describe space customer table demo This is the table name So the corresponding structure got created Customer ID is the number type Name is the vare Gender is the worker Age is the number type Location is the type So successfully created Now once we got successfully created the table the next step is we require to be insert the data into the table we require to be insert the data into the table So when we want to insert the data into the table we need to be use a command called as a DML command DML command data manipulation language command which is called as the insert The insert command we require to be used So how we can we use the insert command means simple insert space into is a keyword we can be used that corresponding table name into which table into which table we want to insert the data the corresponding table name we can be used Okay then space values of we require to add the values now So values of according to the columns we require to be provide the values here So this is the general syntax we can be follow when you want to insert the data into the table So I'm going to be implement now So insert into insert into the table is the customer customer table demo space values of first one is the id So I'm giving 120 3 1 230 is the customer id the name of the customer is the rabbi Next the gender of the customer is the male Next age is the 31 and the location is the wiser y So I have inserted the data successfully So there is one more syntax we can be consider to insert the data that corresponding syntax is like this There is alternative syntax insert into the table name Insert into the table name Here we require to be provide the column number one means column name how many columns are there Only the column names we require to be provided How many columns are there Only the column names are going to be provided here Then keep the space and values of the corresponding values we can be given value 1 comma value 2 So according to the number of columns we require to be and according to the data type and the number of columns we require to be provide the values here So this is another syntax what we can be follow when we want to insert the data into the table So I'm going to be use that now insert into the table name is the customer table demo customer table demo of C id is the one of the column name gender is one more column name is location So total five columns are there All the five column names have been given space values of So we need to be provide the values So 1 0 2 0 3 1 is the ID The name as the uh something like next gender is the female Comma age as the 21 suppose is the location So I have been given enter So one more row created So like this also we can able to be enter So there is one more way So the third way to insert the data is insert into So the table name table name space values of amp% value like this how many values you have according to the number of columns we should be provide that many number of amp% with values multiple condition So this syntax can help to insert the data in like a prompt So like for example if you want to insert the data in runtime So in Java we can be use the scanner right So same like here if you want to insert the data like the prompt we can we use this corresponding amp symbol So I'm going to use that insert into customer table demo values of so amp% customer ID amp% name ampercent gender ament is amp% location so like this we require to be pro enter it can ask the ID suppose I'm giving 1 0 2 0 3 2 this is the ID name is Ashok gender is the male uh age as the 33 and the location is the hyperl enter so one more row created so if you want to repeat it again if you want to enter the data again as a prompt so you can use the slash back slash enter it can give you the prompt again now I'm giving 1 2 0 33 enter now the name is the uh suppose I'm going to give BIC gender is the male age as the 22 location is the car so like this how much data you want to we can able to be entered so once we have inserted the data into the table to store the data into the table permanently to store the data into the table permanently We can use a TCL command We can use a TCL command that is a commit We can use a TCL command that is a commit So by using this corresponding command commit we can able to store the data into the table permanently So I'm using commit command Done So commit is completed So once the committing into the committing the data into the database table permanently we require to be validate whether the data have been created into the database successfully or not So what are the values for added If you want to validate means we require to be displayed for that only we can able to use a command which is called as uh select command The select is one of the DRL command Select is one of the DRL command So the corresponding DRL command which is named as a select by using this we can able to be use the data So the syntax is select star from the table name whatever the table you have the corresponding table name you can be that's it So by using this we can able to get that corresponding data or retrieve that corresponding data for using that select star from the table is the customer table demo enter the table data got displayed but it is not uh proper shape right so if we can able to be give the proper alignment so the corresponding alignment like set line size line size space suppose I'm going to give 250 250 enter now I'm going to use the same select command Now the data can be displayed like this So this is the way how we can able to be and create the table using the create command which is the DDL command and how we can able to be insert the data by using the DML command called as the insert and how we can able to be commit the data using the TCL command and how we can able to be display the corresponding data or validate the data by using the DL command which is the select command So these are the ways what we can be following How we can able to be perform the update on the created table Let us suppose we have the table like this First I'm going to create the table as per our requirement First let me connect with my database Now I'm going to check with whom or with which user I have got connected with the database So show user which is a command can help you to understand who is or which user is connecting with the database right now So I got connected with the admin So that is named as a system Now I'm going to use the create command create for creation of the table So create the table object name is sorry database object name is the table we can give and the table name I used to define like suppose customer table table so this is my this is my table name what I'm going to be so then start the parentheses in between you require to be provide the column names for example I want to give ID I want to give ID ID is the number type Next I want to give name The name is the V which is having the maximum capacity of the 15 And the next one is the gender which is also with the VR of 15 characters The next one is the is which is the number type The next one is the location which is also be the V with the maximum size of three So like this I have a table going to be repeated again Let's create the table Create the database object name is the table The table name is the customer table demo Then start with the parenthesis Here I'm going to be provide ID as the number type Next name which is the w care with the maximum size of the 50 Next gender which is also with a wire care of 15 Next is which is the number type Next location which is also be the vare of 50 So like this I'm going to be create a table So table got created So once the table created if you want to check whether the table has been created or not we can use description space the table name table name is the tab the table name the table name is the customer table demo so the table got uh created it it has the uh minimal structure so this is the structure what we have been created Okay So by using the describe command we can able to be understand whether the table structure got created or not But this corresponding table is empty We require to be insert or we require to be add the data into this table So how we can able to be insert the table data into the table means simple we can use insert insert We require to be insert the data into the table name The table name is what customer table demo this is my table name so I want to insert the values so values of values of suppose I want to uh add amp% IDA amp% name amp% gender comma amp% yes ampercent location So for this I want to add the data So it is asking the ID So let us suppose I'm giving the ID like the,0001 the name as the uh Rahul the gender as the gender as the male then the age as the uh 28 the location as the Hyderabadi So there is an issue So again I want to be repeated So I want to provide,0001 is the ID The name as the Rahul Next the gender as the male Next age as the 28 the location as the full name Enter So one row got created Again I want to insert the data So use the back Then it can give you the chance to give the prompting So I'm going to be give the ID like the,0002 the name as the um rabel the gender as the male the as a 31 and the location as the y location as the y second row got created now I want to insert one more data suppose I'm going to be provide the ID like the 103 the name as the hana and the gender as the female age is as the 29 and the location as the hyer So like this I have added the data So once we have added the data we require to perform the commit Then I want to display the data whether the data have been entered into the table or not inserted into the table or not I want to do so for that I'm using the select command Select star from the table name We're going to be give the table name Here the table name is the customer table demo done the corresponding table have been displayed So it is uh not in proper alignment So we require to be set the data So set line counter So line size we require to be set For example I want to set the line size at the 150 Then again I'm going to use the select command Now the data table can be get displayed with the proper alignment So this is the way that how we can able to be display the data So let us assume this is the table what I have into this into this I want to again perform the insertion I want to perform the insertion again uh with the same uh like for example I want to provide the ID as the 104 the name as the RA again and uh the gender as the male age as the uh 33 location as the head so this is one more table after that I'm going to do the commit now again I'm going to be select the data want to display Okay So this is my table what I have So the table with uh four rows The table with four rows I have So now I want to perform the update Our main target is what instance here I want to perform the update Update the table Update the table So we can perform the table means we can perform the update on the table without the condition and with the condition So first we can see without condition So without condition if you are trying to be do the update perform update update operation on the table it can able to be reflect on all the rows of the table For example we have the syntax like this update update the table name we require to be provide the table name then use the set set So what you want to change So the corresponding column name will require we provide whatever the colon you want to change the corresponding column name and with the new value whatever the new value you want to set the corresponding new value we can be given like this how many how many columns you want to change that many number of columns we required to be provided here colon name and the corresponding new value we require to provide so like this we we required to be repeated So when you are not going to be provide the condition this corresponding syntax can able to reflect the changes or the update on the entire table So I want to show you So for example here I'm using update the table name customer table demo This is my table In this I want to set I want to set the location I want to set the new location the location value as the suppose I want to set all the location information as the Mumbai Mumbai then enter four rows updated means in this table the total four rows are there so all the four rows are getting me updated so whether it is changing or not we require to know so by using the select command select star from customer table demo enter so if you can be observe the location all location or in all the rows the location can be displayed with the Mumbai value So when you are not going to be provide any condition it can be get reflect with the entire table in the all the column it means in all the four rows in all the rows of the table it can be get reflected Okay So not only the single um column we require to be change more than one column also For example I used to define the update ship on the table customer table demo In this table I want to set I want to set the location the location as Bangalore I want to change the location as a Bangalore Comma comma I want to change the I want to change the is as equals to 30 suppose then four rows updated and if I'm going to be perform the select command then see all the is and location of the entire table with all the rows can be get changed so when you can able to be use the update without any condition we required to be means the corresponding uh update can be reflect on the entire table that means how many rows are there in all the rows it can be get updated So here in this syntax we have been means in the update syntax we have been used set is one of the keyword of the SQL which is going to be used as a clause in SQL we have the clauses So set is one of the clause Okay So now now I want to modify I I want to update the table based on the condition In that scenario we can use Second scenario update with the condition means based on the condition we can be based on the condition we can how we can be So if you really want to define the condition the same syntax update the table name set whatever you want to like the column which column you want to change the corresponding value we can be given So like this how many columns you want to change that many number of columns we can be provided So this corresponding setting the corresponding change need to be reflect based on the condition The condition can be reflect with or defined with the where where is also one one of the clause in the SQL which is also act as a keyword here So where the condition we require to be provided here So the condition is where the condition we require to be provide here Okay So this is the simple syntax what we can be follow when we want to perform the update on the table using the uh condition So come back here I'm going to be applying update update the table name the table name customer table table here I want to set I want to set location I want to set the location the location as suppose yag I want to keep yag I want to keep where where um the customer ID where id is equals to,04 where id is equals to,04 enter sorry so here the location equals to we require to be provide where ID equals,000 then one row got updated one row got updated now if you can be check about the select command now see with the ID 10,0004 with the ID,0004 the corresponding location got changed to YZ Okay Similarly we can able to be we can able to be reflect with more than one value also Means update with more than one value also So in this situation we can be provide date update customer table demo In this I want to set I want to set the location with the I want to set the location as USN US Okay And uh means here comma we can be keep is is equals to 31 31 Okay Where where the customer name where the customer name is equals to suppose Ravi I want to consider Ravi Okay Then two rows are updated because in this table with the name of Ravi with the name of Ravi two two rows are there So that is the reason two rows are updated If you can be use the select command then the corresponding change can be reflected on two rows in the row number two and in the row number four like this we can able to be perform the update operation without specifying any condition we can So if you can if you want to define or use the delete without the condition the syntax look like this delete delete from from which table you want to delete that corresponding table name you can make that's it So this syntax can help you to delete the all rows of the table that means it can able to make the table as empty It can remove all the fields of the table what you have been inserted Let us suppose here this is the table what we have the table name is the customers table So from this corresponding table I want to remove all I want to remove all fields We can able to use this corresponding syntax delete space from table name Or else if you want to remove the specific field or the specific row then we can able to define a condition we can allow to be defined the condition So if you really want to define the condition the syntax is delete from the table name we can be provided then where where whatever the condition you want to specify the condition we can be specified that's it this syntax can help you to delete the particular row from the table let us suppose from this corresponding table I want to delete the last row I want to delete the last row then I used to define like delete it is one of the DML command delete from from the table name is the customers table customers table okay I used to define the conditions where where the ID ID is equals to 1993 that's it so according to my condition the table got deleted means the table row got deleted after the deletion if I'm going to be Use select select command for acquiring all the corresponding data for displaying the table data So select the stars from from customers table can we provide see that one of the record row row record with the row got deleted Otherwise if you want to make the table as empty means if you want to remove all the rows from the table then we can able to go with the delete without condition So delete from simply we can use customers table enter all the rows got created If you can we use the select command to display no rows got created because in the table all fields were removed permanently The table was empty now that's why it is going to be display the output as no row selected So this is the way that how we can able to be delete the data from the table or remove the rows from the table How we can alter the table structure So actually using the create command we can create the table So by following the syntax like create table the table name we can be provide table name then after that start the parenthesis and we need to be provide the column names column name one and its corresponding type So how many columns we require that many number of columns we require to be provided along with the type So this is the general syntax what we can be follow for the creation of the table After the creation of the table structure I want to alter the table So before going to see the alter first we can check about the table creation one more time So let me start with the SQL command line we need to be provide connect then give the data and system password sorry one more time connect system user username password connected successfully Now I want to check the user show user So we got the system we got connected with the admin Now I want to create the table structure So create table the table name Suppose I'm going to be provide like a employee table Employee table open the corresponding table consisting of the ID which is the number type number of suppose I'm going to give six Next name is the V type suppose it is having the 30 So like this I have created one table So if you want to know whether the table have created or not we can use that dc command or describe command So d s ra describe the table name So table name is the employee table Enter So we got the table structure So we have one more command also called as a d the table name employee table So we have the same output So using either the describe or DSC we can able to get the clarity whether the table have been created with the defined data or not So once once the table created now on this corresponding created structure I want to perform the alter operation So how we can able to alter the table structure means for that we can use the alter command Alter command The alter command we can use in different situations The first situation is first situation is if you want to add if you want to add if you want to add the new column into existing table we can use the alter command In that scenario we can use the syntax like alter the table object name the table name When you want to add the new borders we can use the add Add is the keyword we can use for the adding Add of add space Add space What is the column you want to add For example I want to add uh column with the type data type We can be specified Whatever the column you want to add the corresponding column we can be done by using this corresponding syntax We can able to be add new element new forums into the existing table New forums into the existing table Okay So here I'm adding only one colon at a time I'm adding only one colon at a time Okay If I want to add more than one that is also be fine So we can keep the parenthesis how many columns that you need that many number of column names we can provide along with the data type along with the data type di this can help you to add the more number of columns also So this is the syntax what we can do So we can implement see suppose I'm using alter table object we are altering the table name is the employee table employee table so I want to add new column suppose ID and name already there so here I want to add I want to add what I want to add suppose I want to add the is is which is the number type required two digits to store the is so I'm taking two comma suppose I want to add gender I want to add the gender The gender is the type of vapor That's it So now the table got aled If you can use the t command then check it into the table there are the two new columns were added So like this if you want to add the new columns into the existing table we can use the alter command Alter command Next the alter command also we can use for to rename the columns To rename the columns or to rename the table to rename the columns or to rename the table we can able to use the alter command In this case the syntax we can able to use like alter the table the table name on which you want to do the rename table name space rename for example I want to rename the column so I'm using polar whatever the old name you have that old name you can provide here old name what you want to change after the using the two you can use the new name by following this corresponding command we can we can alter the rename the foreign name for example here I'm giving alter table object the table name is the employee table I want to rename so rename is the keyword I'm using rename space I want to modify or rename the colon so that's why I'm using the colon colon now the new name I want to give so first which what I want to change suppose I want to change the ID ID I want to change the ID to employee ID Employee ID then table altered in earlier the table consisting of ID as the column name but now it was changed to employee like this we can able to alter the table column name okay only one column at a time we can be modified we can be renamed okay and similarly we can rename the table also if you want to rename the table we can use alter table the table name alter table the table name after that we can use the rename name to rename to whatever the new name we have the corresponding new table name we can be provided so by using this we can alter the table name also suppose I'm using alter table employee table employee table I want to rename two and I want to rename to demo employee demo employee table demo employee table then if I'm going to use D demo table which you can use I got the table So DSC demo employee demo employee rename employee table If you can use the table got printed Okay So if you want to alter the table we can give alter the table name Demo demo ego Y employee table rename rename two to demo employee table employee table and if you can able to use DSC demo employee table So table got printed like this If you want to rename the column name or rename the table we can able to use the alter alter with the rename Next the alter we can also use for remove remove the column We can able to remove the column For this case we can use the syntax like alter table table name We can use space I want to I want to remove I want to remove the column So for this we have we have drop We have the option called as a drop Drop I want to remove means I want to drop the colon Right So that's why I'm using the colon colon What the colon you want to remove the corresponding column we can be provided So we can be provide the column name we can we provide the column name by giving this corresponding syntax that particular column can able to be dropped So let's let's check it Suppose I want to drop gender gender from the corresponding table So alter table table employee table employee table colon colon gender gender So if you can able to use the describe you can get the table with only the three columns now So like this we can able to be perform the drop operation drop Okay next So if I'm trying to be perform the drop with more than one option for example I want to drop name and yes also So then we can use name yes enter So it is going to be show the error That means we can able to drop only one pen at a time We can we rename the pent only one and we can drop or delete or remove only one p at a time That's why we can be get the error here Okay So this is one of the observation what we have Okay Next the last point we can also use the alter We can also use the alter to change the type of the column to change the type of column That means for example the syntax we can able to be followed like this Alter the table the table name in this table in this table I want to modify the type modify the data type for what colon right colon of colon of the name of the column we can we provide the name of the colon So colon name what the new data type we have what the new data type option we have that corresponds with the data we can be provided and we can use for the multiple also means we can repeat this for multiple columns also column name space new data type so like this we can be do so let's check it let's check it for example if you can be go with the scribe we have the table here employee ID name is right I want to change the employee name two size of the 50 So in this case I'm giving alter table demo employee table employee table I want to do modify I want to do modify modify the colon modify the colon of of name space 2 of 50 I want to change this So you can do the directly modify name where character no requirement to provide any column Okay Directly you can do the modify column name and category Okay If suppose you want to modify you want to modify more than one So like for example name I want to change at the same time the same time I want to change the years I want to change the years to number want to change the years to number table altered If you can be use the describe command we can be get the corresponding table according to our requirement So this is the way that how we can able to be create how we can able to be perform the alter alter operation of the create a table structure What is the difference between the trunate and drop So here the trunk and the drop both are dial commands that means data definition language commands Both can be used for delete operation Both can be used for the delete operation That means when we want to delete when we want to delete all records when we want to delete all records from the table permanently here the records means rows simply we can see the data log data So when we want to delete all records or rows from the table permanently we can use we can use trunate trunk command Whereas when we want to delete the table structure when we want to delete the table structure from the database from the database we can use prop command So this is the basic difference between the truncate and drop So how we can able to use the truncate what is a syntax base very simple trunket we are going to be work with the database object called the table space the table name we can be provided the table name that's it this is the syntax for the trunkage and when you want to drop the table permanently from the database even not require the structure then we can go with the drop command the drop command can be used like this So drop space table object name table space the table name drop space table that is a database object name space the table name if you can we follow with this corresponding syntax we can drop the the structure the entire structure so like this we can able to use the translate and drop let's check with this I'm going to start about the SQL command line so first we require to be provide the command pro then provide the username and password then we have connected with the database Oracle database successfully So if you want to know the user who got connected with this corresponding or to this Oracle database software we can use show user show user So the system that means the admin have connected with the Oracle database software once got the clarity that the user who is connecting with this corresponding database then we can check with the truncate and drop now so if you really want to use the truncate and drop first we require the table let's suppose I'm having the table like I'm going to create the table first create table suppose I'm going to create the table like the admi Dummy table start with the fances and provide the ID ID which is the number type number of three means maximum of three digits I want to consider for the ID Next I want to consider the name name is the ware type ware of 30 30 characters are the maximum and I want to consider the age is also be the number type again number with two digits maximum two digits are enough for me next I want to consider the gender gender which is the character type care of 10 I'm going to take that's it that's it so like this I'm going to define that table have created successfully Once the table have created I want to create the records into the table So table is empty Now if you want to know whether the table have created successfully or not you can use tc test desk space the table name dummy table If you can give the table as per the required data as per the given data it has created Now I want to insert the data Inserting the data means we are we require to be add some records into the corresponding table create a table So that's why I'm using the insert insert into into insert into the table name is the dummy table name is the dummy table dummy table values we require to be insert right So values of values of I want to provide the values for ID values for ID amp% ID next amp% name next amp% is next amp% gender none it is asking the value suppose I'm giving the ID like the 101 the name like the Rakkesh or the Rajes is as the 49 nine gender as the uh suppose I'm taking the male male enter so error at line number one we have the error because uh have not been given the data properly so again enter the ID 101 the name is the Rajes the name is the Rajes age as the 49th gender as the male gender as the male then one row created again I want to do the same operation I want to provide the id as the triple 1 name as the uh anil is the name and is as the 32 and general as the male I'm going to be giving next one more row I'm going to be add now so here the ID as the 121 and the name as the margaravi and the age as the 34 gender as the female so like this I have added the three counts three rows means reports I have added So if you want to check it we can use the select command Select start from select star from the corresponding table We can be provided Select star from table What is the table name here Dermit table Dummy table we can be provided Then the table data have been displayed on the screen successfully The data have created or records into the table have added are inserted Now now I want to I want to use the truncate command on this corresponding table what we have created So I'm using trunate truncate space table space dummy table So table truncated So if I'm going to use a select command again it is going to be say the no rows selected no rows selected That means if I'm going to use the test table name as the dummy table dummy table I have the structure I have the structure okay so so here here if I'm going to be inside the data suppose I'm going to be inside the data insert 101 the name as the radish and age as the 34 gender as the male done one row I have added okay so now I have the data the data let let's use the select command now see the table with the one report we have okay now if I'm going to use the drop drop table dummy table dummy table enter table dropdown after the dropping if I'm going to be use select command it is going to be show the error and the error is describing you that the table ar does not exist if you are going to be use the test desk test Commander DSC and the table name even that is going to be not display the structure object That means here the difference is what truncate can able to remove or delete all the records from the table permanently but drop can able to delete the structure of the table from the database This is the basic difference between the truncate and drop Is it possible to retrieve and restore the drop tables So just before like in previous class we have discussed how the blanket can work and how the drop can work Pancate can able to delete all the records from the table Here the record is nothing but the row but it can maintain the structure of the table whereas prop can able to delete the whole structure of the data or whole structure of the table from the Oracle database So here if I'm going to be perform the drop operation on the table whether we can able to be retrieve it back or not and restore it or not that we need to check it So here is it possible means yes it is possible in the Oracle database for the windows we have the option called as recycle then you can able to be delete any file from our laptop from our system the corresponding data in the Windows operating system can store into the recycle bin so if required we can be restore it back so same like in the Oracle database software We have Oracle recycle table when you can able to be perform the drop operation on the table the corresponding drop tables are going to be stored into Oracle recycle bin So when we required we can be retrieve that and restore that also So today we can learn how to retrieve How to retrieve the drop table So when you want to retrieve the drop table we can able to use a simple command which is the DRL command called as select selection By using this we can able to be retrieve the dropper table How By using the corresponding syntax like select star from recycle bin Select the star from recycle belly By using this we can able to be retrieve it Let's check it for example So Oracle database I'm going to be do login So I'm going to be do login with the system So go login with the user as well I'm working with I'm working with the uh means I'm going to be logging with the anal Now see here going with the SQL workshop go to the SQL commands and create one table first create table dummy table create dummy table So the table consisting of the elements like like coland's id the number of three name which is having the w care of 30 yes the number of two like this I have a table let's run this command so name is already existed so that means we have the table here we have the table Here the corresponding dummy table is already existing If you can be check select star from dummy table you can use the select command and make it run and check it here the table table is existed So the dummy table there is one table there is one table So if suppose I'm going to be perform the drop operation of the table drop on this table I'm going to be perform drop table the table name is the dummy table and let's run the code or see table drop table drop when I was perform the drop operation the corresponding table can store into can store into oracle recycle bin I want to retrieve it so how we can able to be retrieve means by using the DRL command which is the select sheet Select is the DRL command Select start from select start from recycled menu Recycle menu If you can use this and run the command see this the table what we have dropped Okay that is going to be shown So we are retrieving we are retrieving So according to this we can understand when we can be perform the prop operation on the table or any database object it can be stored into the Oracle database uh recycle bin Okay So if I want to be restore it how we can we in sense to restore to restore the corresponding data We can use the flashback The command called as a flashback Flashback space Table is the object We need to be restore the table The corresponding table is one of the object that object name we are using table space Now now we require to be provide the table name What is the table name here Dummy table Dummy table I want to restore it before the dropper Whatever the table I have I want to restore it So I'm using before dropper Done Done If you can run the code Now see statement processed Statement processed Now now if I'm using the select command select star from dummy table Select the star from dummy table Then run the code we can retrieve the corresponding data means restore whatever the data have been dropped that was restored So like this like this we can able to be retrieve the data and restore the data after the dropping after the drop the corresponding table Okay And and suppose you want to you want to delete that corresponding data from the recycle bin also oracle recycle bin also So for that we can able to use a command called as the person suppose suppose I'm going to use drop drop space the table table name is a dummy table name is a dummy table if you can run the code table drop table drop if I'm going to use the command called as a select star from dummy table dummy table and make it run the we cannot be get it Table was deleted Table was dropped from the corresponding database Okay Now now suppose if I'm going to use if I'm going to use select star from recycle bin and make it run this corresponding query we can able to retrieve that Whatever the table we have dropped we can able to retrieve that Okay But I want to make it delete from the Oracle database uh recycle bin also In that scenario we can use first command First p first first the table the table name is the dummy table name is the dummy table Done If you can run the code the corresponding statement processed Okay And after this if you can we use select star from recycle bin Select star from recycle bin Okay let's run the code and observe the corresponding dummy table is not shown So like this if you want to delete the data from the Oracle recycle bin also then we can use the pseud command like this Like this we can able to we can able to use the select command for retrieving flashback command for restore the data from the recycle bin and the purge command for deleting the data from the recycle bin of the Oracle database software We can learn about these two interview questions How to display all the tables on the currently connected database and how we can drop the user which we connected earlier So first question how to display all the tables from the currently connected database So how we can be displayed So there is a there is a command which is the TRL or the DQL command called as the selection By using this corresponding command we can able to be display all the tables what we have So select star from P from tab So if you can use this command we can able to make it display all the commands what means all the tables what we have on this corresponding uh database with the user uh what we have been connected with which user have been connected with on the corresponding users database what are all the tables if you want to know we can be use this corresponding command let's check about it so for example I'm going to start about the Oracle database software get login with the admin DBA then connect with the one of the user let's connect with one of the user so here login here I'm logging with the now I'm going to be check about the SQL workshop go to SQL commands and give a command called as select start from tab then run that command we can see all the corresponding tables what we have in this corresponding database like the the database user who is having the name as an in that database these are all the tables what we have all the tables were listed okay next how we can prop the user which we connected earlier for example at the time of installation of the Oracle database software using the CLI and using the web application and GUI we have created the multiple users rather than the system rather than the means DB account rather than the DB account we have created the multiple users okay so how we can able to drop the user which we have created using the CLI RGI whatever it is so for that only we can able to use a command called the drop drop user user whatever Whatever the username we have the corresponding username we can use username cascade cascade by using this corresponding command we can able to be drop the user what what you want to be deleted or drop from the database So for example when you want to drop the user from the database which we have created earlier first we require to be do the login with DBA means we the DBA account we need to be used to drop the user For example if you can try to be drop the user like Ravi from the account of Anil it is not possible the DB account the DB account means database admin only can able to drop the user So that is the reason I'm going to be I'm going to be log out from this account and uh I'm going to start with the command line of SPL So let's connect I'm giving the DBA details system and system So connected successfully So let me check whether I have connected with the DBA details or not So show us So I was connected with the DVA account DV account Now now first of all I want to check what are all the users under this DB account we have So how we can be in sense simple we can use select star from select star from all underscore users All users that's it by giving this how many users were there How many users like see Pakkesh Kumar Anil Desh Katik Okay So these are all the users what we have like 21 rows are going to be selected So that means under this under this admin there are these are all the users what we have Suppose I want to remove the account of Rakkesh So how we can be in simple drop user prop user rackish that's it If you can be use this corresponding command the corresponding user can be dropped So if you can be use the same command like select star from all users then in that Rakkesh is not available So like this what are all the users you want to drop you want to delete from the database Okay first we need to be do the login with the DBA from the DBA only we can able to drop the user whatever you want means which user you want to drop So like this we can able to use the drop command for dropping the user from DBA account The difference is between the truncate and delete So trit is one of the d command whereas delete is one of the dml command So trunket is ddl command This is one difference Whereas delete is one of the DML command line So this is the first difference what we have The second difference is truncate can delete Trate can delete all the records all the records from the given table from the given table Whereas the delete can the delete can delete the delete can delete all the records all the records and or the specific the specific record from the given table from the given table Third difference So for example when you want to uh delete all the records using the truncate we can use truncate table the table name by using this corresponding syntax we can able to delete all the records from the table but delete from delete from the table name If you can use it can help you it can help you to delete the all all records all records as like the trunkage but but the delete can also be used to delete the specific record So for that case we can use delete from table name we can able to define the where condition So based on the condition based on the selection it can allow to be deleted the specific record from the table So this is also one more difference what we have So here the truncate not allow not allow to delete trunate not allow to delete the specific record but delete can do Delete can do Okay So these are the differences what we have between the truncate and delete So the select command is one of the DQL command So here the DQL is abbreviated as data quiry language command It is also called as DRL command So TRL stands for data retrieval data retrieval language collection So what the select can do So usually the select command select command can use to retrieve can use to retrieve the data from the table So usually here the select command can perform the two operations There are the two operations the select command per can perform One is selection Second one is projection One is a selection Second one is a projection So what are these How we can define it Selection is nothing but retrieving the data Retrieving the data from retrieving the data from the table from the table based on the condition based on the condition is what called as a selection Whereas projection is nothing but retrieving of the data Retrieving of the data from the table Retrieving of the data from the table Here the data of what Retrieving of the data retrieving the data of retrieving the data of specific or selected columns from the table is called as a production So if you really want to retrieve the data from the table based on the condition or the whole table from all means how many records we have from the table or in the table all the records you want to be get okay then we can go for the selection So for that case the syntax we can able to be used like select a star from the table name Select a star from table name This can help you to get all the records of the table Whereas if you want to get the specific record then we can use select a star from table name table name space where the condition we can be specified here according to the condition it can able to be returned So when you can able to use the corresponding select command for retrieving of all the records or specific report based on the condition what is what called as your selection If you want to retrieve the data from the data of specific columns from the table then that is what called the projection So to do the projection the syntax we can able to be followed like this Select select No requirement to use the star here You required to give the colon names like col one col two How many columns you want to retrieve All the columns we can be give with the comma separation and use the from from the table name That's a by using this corresponding command we can able to perform the projection So let's check about it Let's suppose I'm going to start about the command line command line and I'm going to be means I'm trying to be connect with the database using the username as the and password as the rabbit 2019 So I'm using connect give the name as the system and password as the system So connected successfully Now what I'm going to do I'm going to be create a table First create the table Create the table The table name is the dummy table Dummy table Provide the id which is the number having the length of three name where of 20 Yes Yes which is also with the number of number of table created Let's insert the data insert insert into the table name is the dummy table What I want to insert in values so I use to insert all three values So what are those ID comma name is done ID is the 101 name is the Rabi age is the 31 done next again I want to repeat it ID is the 102 name is the something like age as the 21 so two rows are created let's give select star from dummy table So if we are going to use this we got we got the whole table So that means in the table how many records I have inserted all the records are printed So this is what called as selection Suppose I want to display only one specific row like the row with I want to display a row with the id as 102 So in that case we can use select start from the table name is the dummy table where where ID equals to suppose I'm using 102 then the corresponding only the selected record got displayed so when you can able to be retrieve the data based on the condition then we can go with then it is what called as a selection selection but but I want to I want to retrieve the data of the specific column from the table Then we can say that is what called as a projection For that we can use select select Suppose I want to I want to consider uh the column name as the ID column name as the ida name yes Okay from from the table dummy table then see what happened here I have been given I have been given select a star from dummy table sorry select ID name yes from the dummy table so here ID 101 name ra 31 yes 31 suppose if I'm going to select id ID from from table so only one ID get can be get displayed Okay if you want to retrieve the data from the columns data of the columns from the table then we can go with the projection projection with the set command So the select command can able to perform the two types of operations here Select selection and projection So this is about the select command We can discuss about the unique constraints Unique constraints So it is very important uh concept from the oracle So first of all we require to know why constraints the constraints actually constraint constraint is a condition constraint is a condition when you want to define the tables when you want to define the table So to define the table or to create the table we require to use the real commands at the time of creation of the table we require to use the constraints If you want to create the table as per the business logic or as per the client requirement we can go with the constraints So this is the reason that why the constraint is so constraints can be used with the DDL commands data um database definition language commands DDL database definition language commands mean at the time of the creation of the table we required to use or at the time of altering the table we required to use the constraints when you want to create the objects of the database based on the business logic we can go with the constraints So that's why we can able to apply the constraints at the means with the DDL commands So why we required to use the constraints with the DDL commands means well we want to create any database object based on the business logic or based on the business requirement we can go with the constraints So that's why we require to use the constraints with the we require to use the constraints with So here the constraints can be defined at two levels So one is colon level constraints Second one is the table level constraints One is the table column level constraint Second one is the table level constraints So colon level constraints column level constraints mean at the time of defining of the colon if you can able to define the constraint then we can say that is a colon level constraint Table level constraint means at the end of the table at the end of the table if you can able to apply if you can able to apply the constraint then we can say that is a table level constraint So these are the two levels of constraints we can use when you can able to apply the constraint at the along with the definition along with the definition of the column then we can say that is a column level if you can define the constraint after the means at the end of the table means after all the columns then we can able to say that is a table level constraints So the constraints are of several types So the one popular constraint is unique constraint So first of all why exactly the requirement of the unique constraints that we require to know So let's suppose let's suppose I'm going to create a table create table create table with suppose the name roots suppose the name roots So here I'm going to give S N O serial number serial number So which is the number type number of suppose um four digit I'm taking four digit comma root name root name which is the V type of suppose maximum of 30 characters So this is my table what I'm creating So after the creation of the table if I'm going to insert the data insert into fruits insert into fruits what I want to insert suppose values I want to insert here so values of values of suppose I'm going to be provide the serial number as 01 and the fruit name is the apple fruit name is the apple then one row created so if I used to give the same same column number like 01 only but I used to define the KV key after that row got created if I used to define null as the ID and value as the value as the uh suppose banana I'm going to give so enter row got created and if you can able to print the table select star from the table name is the fruits enter the table got created and open So if you can be observed if you can be observed the corresponding the corresponding table has been created with the duplicate serial number and uh with the null with the null serial number So so when you are going to create the table without the constraints your table data might be inaccurate Your table data might be inaccurate To define the table accurately according to the business logic we can use the constraints This is the reason that why the constraints are So here unique constraints unique constraints means when you want to allow the colon of the table uniquely when you want to define the table colon uniquely then unique constant we can be used Unique constants we can be used like suppose I want to say the serial number I don't want to use I don't want to use uh the with the duplication with the duplication then we can go the unique constraint to keep the serial number as the serial number as the unique okay how we can able to how we can able to so here I'm going to write the syntax for the unique constraint syntax for unique constraints syntax for the unique constraints so how we can be defined so if you want to define the unique constraint at the column level Then use the syntax like create table the table name then start with the parenthesis You can provide the column name one with the data type data type Next column number two or the column name two data type like this how many columns you want that many columns we can be keep right So at the time of the column definition only if you can able to use the keyword called as a unique you can able to use the keyword called as a unique okay then we can say that is what called as the that is what called as the colon level colon level uh unique constraint colon level unique constraint okay so let me check with this so for example here for example I'm going to I'm going to create the table first let me draw the table Just drop the table fruits Drop the table fruits So table dropped Okay Now I'm going to create the table again But before I want to delete the table from the uh recycle bin also completely So ped tables I'm using So table ped So the table we can we cannot be restore it into the Oracle database again Okay It was deleted permanently even from the Oracle database recycle bin Okay Now I'm going to create the table with the name fruits with the name fruits Okay So here here serial number is one of the element which is the number type number of four I'm going to take take uh I'm going to take so if suppose I'm going to give after this column if I'm using the keyword unique unique okay and and first name first name which is the vcap which is a vcare of suppose 20 characters I'm taking and the last named last name which is the vcapare of vcare of 20 characters I'm taking so closing the table so table got created table got created now now if I'm going to be insert insert into insert into fruits okay so I want to insert the values so values of suppose I'm giving the uh number mean serial number as the one and the fruit name as the Apple root name as the apple So yeah sorry So so here uh the one more element we required to be add apple um fruit I'm going to give the apple fruit Done Enter One row created One row created Okay Now if I'm going to be perform insert into now now if I'm trying to be if I'm trying to be use the null as the serial number and and banana as the first element banana fruits fruits as the last element if I'm going to be defined okay so now see table row created so if I'm going to use a select select a star from fruits select a star from fruits so we got it we got it now if I'm going to be insert if I'm going to be insert the serial number as the one again but the fruit as the kiwi kiwi fruits I'm writing kiwi fruits I'm writing now enter if you can be observed we got the error unique constraint unique constraint on the given database the constraint number the constraint name that Oracle has been provided like this for every constraint there is a name can be given by the Oracle database by default that is like sis C0007351 violated It is saying amen you have said the serial number as the unique So the same number same number you are trying to be enter I can't be taken So like this like this if you want to say if you want to say the table I want to create with create with unique data then we can go with the unique constraint So here the unique constraint have been defined on the column level But I want to define the unique constraint from the table level means at the table level Then let me drop the table Drop table roots Now I want to p the table P roots Enter So table got ped Okay Now now I want to create the constraint at the table level So for the table level we can able to give the syntax like this create table name table name okay then start with the parenthesis So whatever the column name you want to give column name data type we can be specified So like this how many columns you want that many number of columns we can be provided here data type Okay after all the column names you can able to provide you can able to use a class a class the class name is the constraint in the SQL in the SQL we have a class which is called as a constraint the constraint is the keyword we can be used can be defined for the constraint class okay constraint constraint after this we require to be provide the constraint name whatever the constraint name you want you can be provide constraint name space the corresponding unique is the keyword we can use unique of which colon which column you want to you want to perform means you want to define as the unique that colon that colon you can able to be defined here that's it that's it so this is the syntax this is the syntax can help you to define the table level constraint so table level constraint is nothing but the constraint can able to be defined at the end of at the end of the table which is the table level constraint If you can able to define the constraint at the column level that is what means along with the column definition then we can say that is a column level constraint Okay So now I want to implement this Let's create a table Create table with the name fruits Here I'm going to define serial number Serial number which is the number of five which is the number of five Next fruit name fruit name I'm going to take it like the var 2 of 50 next I want to define the quantity I want to define the quantity okay quantity is again be the number number of suppose I'm going to take three number of three done so here we require to here we require to define the constraint so constraint is a keyword constraint is a keyword we can use constraint whatever the name you want to define You can give for example unique unique fruit unique fruit is the constraint name I'm using space unique of unique of suppose I want to provide the corresponding serial number only serial number only as the unique constraint as the unique so got created got created so like this if you can able to define the constraint at the end of the table then we can say that is table level constraint to define the table level constraint we can use the constraint class okay so here if I'm trying to be insert the data insert into fruits insert into fruits values of values of suppose I'm going to be provide 102 is the serial number I'm going to use apple I'm going to use apple and the count is the 100 count is the 100 done row inserted row insert If I'm going to be define now 122 is the fruit and I'm defining the banana the count is the count is the 400 then insert row inserted row inserted if I can be print the table select star from the table name is the fruits and we got the table okay but when I'm going to be inside the data with the same same serial number like 102 but the different fruit the different fruit is like the jack fruit I'm going to define jack fruit okay the count is like the 200 if you can if I can be enter so definitely I can get the above in earlier when I have used column level constraint for the column level constraint the Oracle database has been given the constraint name but now but now when I'm going to be perform the table level constraint using the constraint class the user have been given the constraint name now with that name the violation can be displayed So like this like this we can able to define the constraints at the column level and the table level So here the unique constraint is nothing but when you want to make the table without uh with the unique way means with unique data then we can go with the unique constants But here the advantage with advantage with the unique constraint is what in sense we can able to make the means we can able to uh define the unique constraint on more than one colon also return This is the advantage with the unique constant I want to prove you that So first let me drop the table again Drop the table name is the fruits Now I want to p the table from the database P the table fruits Now now I'm going to means I want to define I want to define the unique constraint on more than one column at a time So for that create create the table table whatever the table name you have you can be provided Okay Start with the parenthesis So you can provide the colon name with its data type colon name with its data type Okay Like this How many you want that many you can be defined Okay Suppose I want to make define the unique constraint on more than one colon Then you can use the constraint class again Constraint of constraint of you can provide the constraint name Constraint name space unique unique of how many columns you want that many number of columns we can be provided done this is the syntax what we can be so let me implement about this so here here if I'm going to be create the table again create table with the name of the fruits now I want to provide the serial number which is the number of suppose I'm going to give four comma comma fruit name which is the v2 of 50 Maximum length is a 50 Next quantity I want to define the quantity The quantity is again with the number type Number of suppose I'm going to take the four Done Done Okay Now what I want to do I want to I want to define the constraint So constraint is the keyword which is representing the constraint class Okay The constraint name we require to be provided So the constraint name is the unique fruit Unique fruit is the constraint name I'm given Okay Space unique is the keyword we can be used So what are all the columns What are all the columns you want to make unique You can be provided For example I want to make serial number at the same time quantity also Or else name also root name also I want to make it uh unique So done Done So if you can be give table got created Okay So if I'm going to be insert insert into fruits insert into fruits values of suppose I'm giving 101 is the number serial number the fruit I'm going to be provide like the apple the fruit and the quantity I'm taking like the 500 done after that if you can enter row created so if you can able to print select select if you can use the select so enter the table got create created now if you can Enter the serial number as the 121 and I'm going to be provide here the ki ki okay which is having the count as 1500 enter row created row created and if you can use the select command k entered okay now this time if I'm going to be enter the same ID 121 but I'm going to define the different fruit like the jack fruit different fruit like the jack fruit jack fruit having the count again 400 data enter So now now row created row created Okay So if you can able to print this so with the with the same name with the same name we got the output Suppose I'm going to provide I'm going to provide here k again again I'm giving with the different value 1400 Now see the error Now see the error means we are saying we are saying I want to get the violation means I don't want to repeat the I don't want to repeat the same data same name and the same key same key to define the different value different value in that case in that case we can able to provide the constraint with two values so if you want to define the unique constraint unique constraint on more than more than one column we can able to use the constraint plus so like this we can allow to be define the unique constant Friends thank you for watching

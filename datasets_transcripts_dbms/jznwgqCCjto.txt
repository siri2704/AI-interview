our students welcome back to our class of the DVRs from the last few classes we have already discussed about your diagram or entity relationship diagram in this class we are going to discuss with one particular example now in this example we are designing ER diagram for a publishing company now our given problem is like that a publishing company produces books on many subjects okay from this line we are having to information actually three sitting promotion one is we have a publishing company so we will simply make one rectangle there okay and we will write for this earth here because we have a publishing company now it produces books okay done entities I am just simply identifying the entity this is really a very practical approach how you can design one actual database publishers and books okay now the relationship is like that one publishing company produces any book so whether one company can produce many books okay so it will be one to benefit other now these books are written on various subjects so we know that one book can be written on a particular subject only so neck like this this is the relationship between the books and subject this books about this subject now one book is written about a particular subject but for a particular subject you can have many books so it will be many what is it we after that one book can be written on a particular subject but for a particular subject you can have many books okay now from this line only over this information open up the books are written by authors who specializes in one subject okay so we will add another entity good books written by the author now see is there any specification that whether a single book can be written by a single author or not because one other can write many books okay let me check the books are written by the author who specializes in one subject raga now there is another specialization nice correct specialize in one particular sell to the company in your editor should necessary mean specialist on one particular area each take the responsibility for editing one or more publishing okay now there is nothing written so we are taking one assumption that one author can write it we know that one author then write many books and one book can be written by many authors also so I am making it n is 2 n relationship now let me repeat if one author can write only one book then that will be image to one another wise in this case I am assuming that one who can be written by many authors also okay so as we gone before there must be some book ID hide a primary key and also must be some who has taken my previous classes already know who I am why I am doing this e IG or author holiday because when you are doing any many to many relationship then this relationship table must exist right and for that you need the unique ID right now these two will be primary key ok done now the company employees editors who not necessary being specialist in a particular area so now let me finish this also one author specialized in one particular subject ok so this is clear that one author can be expert on a particular subject but for a particular subject you can have any other one is too many now company implies editor who not necessarily being specialist in a particular area each can show responsibility for editing one or both book publication okay now so this will be editor and this is relationship within the editor than now one editor can publish one book but one editor can also publish many book but one book can be published by a particular editor so this will be one done now a particular responsible for editing every book requires some items for publication eat these items supplied by supply okay good so there will be software and items flash now one supplier can let me check these items supplied by supply one supplier can supply many items ok now one supplier can supply many item and it is very easy to assume that one item can be supplied by any Instagram so it will be M is 2 n relationship now this will be exciting this will be I employ I tie my deck Oh now a collection over again close to the proper down okay understand how these are required for whoa so this in your required table very quick looks required fight em now one book require many items and one item can be used for more required for many books in this way we're when to my relationship - so this will be M is to M ok so it has become so much consistent so elated how I cannot manage it this is why IIT IIT and this in your life go by day okay here join them okay done and the next thing is that everyone refer some publication is you'll be supplied by some supper the supply can any item now shop owner buy books from one publisher and so watch out okay now we need to make one shop owner why just become little congested okay please consider this line will not interrupt this about which is it table okay done now see so upon our can buy books from supplier and supplement and buy many books but one book and ok now so this will be 1 if one is one sub can buy many books but one book can be edit it ok so this is a sample any relationship that for this given problem in our forthcoming classes I am going to discuss about more examples and few topics like specialization I cherish and also for its state in wishes thank you

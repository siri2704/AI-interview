in this video we are going to discuss about introduction to database management system such as what is data what is information what is knowledge what is database what is database management system as well as what are the advantages of dbms and database applications and what are the best examples for dbms we are going to discuss all these concepts in this video first let us see what is data what is data data means it is a collection of facts collection of facts about anything about anything so it may be about student or it may be about employee or it may be about an university or it may be about hospital so it may be on anything so collection of facts about anything is called as data data about student data about student includes so what is the major data of student role number name mox etc okay so this is the main data of the student data means unprocessed that means it is ra so data means unprocessed unprocessed set of inputs unprocessed set of inputs is called as data so that means data means it is ra it is original if you take the marks of a student let a class contains uh 70 students so the marks of all the 70 students is nothing but data of the student okay so data means mocks of a class so mocks of a class is nothing but data let a class contains 70 students information so those 70 students information is nothing but data now let us see information so this is very very important what is information information means meaningful data meaningful data is called as information meaningful data that means information means it is processive data information means process of data here we have 70 student marks are available okay let us assume that we have calculated average box average marks of a class okay so calculating average box is nothing but information information or let us assume that we need to find a number of students who got greater than 60 percentage of mocks okay so how many students are there who got greater than 60 percentage of mocks this is nothing but information information means performing operations on the data and retrieving the result according to our requirement so this is called as information various data means all the students information is data various information means meaningful data that means by using some commands we will retrieve the data so that is nothing but information now let us see the next terminology the next terminology is knowledge what is knowledge knowledge means making use of the information so using the information is nothing but knowledge so the students who got greater than 60 percent they are eligible for placement drives that means if their percentage is less than 60 then they are not eligible for the placement drives okay so that means here knowledge means we are making use of the information and we are deciding the facts we are deciding some results based upon the information so this is about what is data what is information what is knowledge so knowledge means making use of the information and deciding the results okay now let us see about the next terminology that is database what is database what is database database means collection of related data database is collection of related data collection of related data if you take student database it contains roll number name some box let the rule number is one some name is ramesh let the box are 95 okay so why it is called as related data because there is a relation between rule number and name and marks by using rule number we can retrieve the name as well as by using the name we can retrieve the rule number by using mocks also we can retrieve roll number and name so that means all the fields here are interrelated so that's why we can call database as collection of related data so there is a relation between one field to the remaining fields let us see some examples uh database applications let us see some applications of the database database applications if you take any university any university is an example for the database why because in university we have to maintain students information we have to maintain faculty information we have to maintain courses information non-teaching faculty information so we need to maintain all those information so for that purpose we use the database next hospitals so hospitals is also an example for the database application why because in hospital we need to maintain list of doctors list of patients list of diseases so everything we need to maintain so for that purpose we use just the database if you take railway railway so railway reservation so we have to maintain what here also we have to maintain the schedule information okay we have to maintain the schedule information so for that also we require the database okay now let us see about likewise we can have several applications some airplane reservation okay so likewise we can have a number of applications now let us see about dbms so dbms in short we can dbms stands for what database management system database management system in short we can call as dbms so what is a dbms dbms is a software it is a software software which is designed which is designed to store and manage the data to store and manage the data so this is the major advantage of the dbms dbms means a software we know what is a software software means a program program means a collection of instructions so dbms means a large program it is a software so why we are using the dbm is in order to store the database and manage the database so manage the database means we can perform several operations on the database so why we are using that dbms the primary goal of dbms is convenient to use convenient as well as efficiency so it should be dbms should be convenient to the user so it is very very easy to use the dbms and efficient it is very very efficient why because we can perform the operations very very easily very very efficiently on the dbms using several commands okay so that is about what is dbms and what are the goals of dbms it should be convenient as well as efficient okay now let us see the best examples for the dbms the best examples for the dbms are moroccan so variable is the most commonly used dbms and microsoft sql server microsoft sql server is also the best examples for the dbms and we have mysql so mysql is also best example for the dbms we have bb2 so these four are the most commonly used databases okay so this is about what is data what is information what is knowledge what is database and database applications what is dbms and what is dbms and the best examples of the dbms now let us see about advantages of the dbms totally mainly we have seven advantages are there let us see all the advantages one by one the first advantage is data independence so what is data independence here the developer of the application doesn't have to know about how the data is actually stored in the hard disk or the developer of the application doesn't have to worry about how the data is represented internally in the hard disk so mainly two points so the developer of the application doesn't have to know about how the data is actually stored in the hard disk as well as the developer of the application doesn't have to worry about how the data is internally represented why because here mainly here we have two types of levels are there the first level is physical level the second level is logical level mainly we have two levels are there physical level and logical level physical level means the data the data of the database the actual data the troll number one ramesh some ramesh and uh rule number name and mocks so one rummage 90 so that is nothing but actual data actual data means physical level various logical level means logical structure so that means whether it is a number or whether it is where care or which constraints we imposed that means whether it is primary key or unique or foreign key or candidate key so that is nothing but logical level so here the advantage is we can change database schema at one level without changing database schema yet the second level so that means we can change database schema at physical level without changing database schema at logical level and vice versa we can change database schema at logical level without changing database schema at physical level so this is called as independence why because without modifying the second level we can update the one level first level okay so this is called as data independence and the second one is efficient data access so with the help of the dbms we can store the data as well as we can perform the operations very very efficiently using several commands so we have create command insert command delete command update command drop command so likewise several commands are there so by using those commands we can perform the operations very very efficiently and the next one is data integrity so data integrity means data in the dbms must be valid for that purpose we have to enforce the integrity constraints we will discuss about integrity constraints later constraints we have to enforce integrity constraints on the data if you take the date of birth so data but can never be future date okay it should be past date only so that is nothing but integrity constraint if we impose the primary key then it should contain what it should be unique and it should not contain it should contain some value so that is nothing but imposing the integrity constraints so that is called as data integrity so for integrity what we have to do we have to maintain the integrity constraints so the best example is date of birth it never be future date okay now let us see about data consistency what is data consistency the best example for the data consistency is transferring money between two bank accounts we can transfer money between two bank accounts only if those two accounts are updated correctly if those are not updated correctly then it is inconsistent consistent means those two accounts must be updated correctly so then only we can perform the operation and the next one is enable concurrent access so concurrent means multiple users can access the database simultaneously multiple employees can access the database simultaneously and update their information according to the requirement so employee one can update his details employee two can update her details okay so those things will be done parallelly continuously concurrently simultaneous access and the next one is ensures data recovery suppose if the database crashes if the database server crashes then we should not worry about that very very easily we can recover our data so that is the advantage of the dbms if the database crashes then then also there is no problem we can recover our data very very easily and the last one is enable data security so we can enable data security to the dbms very very efficiently let me have three databases so database one database two database three let me have two users user one user two so we can enforce some data security who can access which data so for example user one can access only database one whereas user two can access all the three databases so likewise we can enforce some security we can enable data security so this is about introduction to database management system

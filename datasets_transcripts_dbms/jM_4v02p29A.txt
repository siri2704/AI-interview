hello everyone today we are going to look at how 
we can make this E R diagram, Chen E R diagrams   with chat G P T. without wasting our time I'll 
go to chat G P T and I will put the prompt   there. you might have to follow this prompt as 
it is without making any changes except for this   part. I am making an example of an e-commerce 
application you can put your own thing there,   or put some details there. And then you have to 
run this prompt and then you have to go to Google   colab. So basically you have to go this URL and 
you might need to log in with your Gmail account,   if you are using this the first time. then 
you have to start a new notebook it will look something like this. okay. it might take a 
little time. but it will prompt you to start   a new notebook and then you just have to click on 
new notebook. yep and hopefully we have our code   ready. then yeah so before running the r code we 
have to go to runtime and select change runtime   type and select R here and then click on save. 
so we know this run time is for the R language   and then we'll put our code 
here and we'll run our code   this may take like 4 to 5 minutes. 
it will have to install some libraries and yes after this is done running, it will 
give you some file. and then you'll download   this file. okay so you have to click this
folder here and there should be your file and   when you and on when you'll download this file 
by clicking on this three dotted menu download   it and open this and you will see something 
similar to this or whatever you prompted it   so that is it that's all there is to  E R
diagram making with chat g p t. thank you for watching

here in this session we are discussing how the mapping cardinalities can be mapped onto the ear diagram so how the mapping cardinal readings can be implemented on an ear diagram using proper examples you are we are having a separate video where you have discussed what is mapping cardinalities so we are having four different types of mapping cardinalities that is the min remaining many-to-one one-to-many and one-to-one so let us discuss all of them in this particular order one by one with proper example C so here you see this is a board word relationship this is a loan entity this is one customer entity with this customer entity this set of attributes are connected this customer ID is the primary beautyrx against this loan these are the set of attributes this loan number is the primary root because it is underlined bar word is the relationship so let us go or in this particular sequence many to many many to one one to many one to one in the earlier video we have discussed already that in case of many to many there will be no arrow as I haven't given here in case of many to one there will be arrow from this side to that side always remember whenever I am finding one that side will be one arrow whenever I shall be finding one this side will be having arrow whenever we are having one on both sides then arrow will be there on both sides just remember this one that will be easier for you to understand so let us go for the first one that is the many to many many to many means against one customer ID we are having multiple loan IDs that means this particular bank issues multiple parallel loans parallel loan means a customer can enjoy multiple loans say one say one house loan he has taken one educational loan I say another one is say for some property loan so in this way mortgage loan in this way multiple loans this particular bank is issuing against one customer but this side is also many that means against one loan number we're having multiple customer ideas that means in case of business law let us suppose you and myself has we have decided that we shall take one loan from the bank and you shall do one business so in that case that will be known as the group loan antic I'm just considering that considering that one as a group loan so group loan means against one loan number we are going to have multiple customer IDs and against one customer ID we'll be having multiple loan numbers so we can issue that we can write in this way this particular bank in this particular case minute many issues parallel multiple parallel group loans or personal loans so in this way we are depicting this many-to-many that means against one customer ID one or more than one low-90s against one loan ID one or more than one personal IDs so that is the that is their respective inference in case of mainly two one so let me write that one so many to one means error will be coming to this particular site many to 1 that means against loan number against one loan number we can have one or more than one customer IDs but against one customer ID there will be only one loan number that means this bank issues group or personal loan which is non parallel that means a customer cannot cannot enjoy more than one loans because against one customer ID there will be one loan number but against one loan number there will be multiple customer ideas so as an inference I can tell that these bent issues in this particular case that is many to one cardinality ratio non parallel group loan or personal loan next one we are going for this that means the error will be directed here that means the arrow will be directed here so there will be no arrow here only the ad will be on this particular site so this is my mini and this is my one so hey this is mine one sorry this is my one and this is my many so this is my one and this is my many and will be directed towards the one so now what does it mean it means that this particular customer can take multiple loans but one roll number is having only one customer ID so one customer ID can have one on more than one loans but against one roll number there will be one customer ID that means this bank does not issue any group loan they issue only the personal loans so as a result of that I can write multiple parallel personal loans these bent issues because against one loan number there will be one customer ID so it is the personal loan not a group loan and against one customer ID we are having multiple known numbers that means in parallel the customer can enjoy multiple loans personal loans let us go for one-to-one in case of one-to-one add it will be on the both sides so that means against one customer there will be one loan number so this is a personal loan and against one roll number there will be only one customer so this is a personal loan because against one loan number there will be one customer ID and against one customer ID that will be one loan number that means we are having non parallel personal loans so if I have taken loan from this particular Bank until and unless I pay the full money back bank will not issue another loan against my customer ID so in this way this for cardinal readings have got four different meanings I have done the listing here accordingly you can easily take the note and understand the process so giving arrows are not giving arrows it matters a lot thanks for watching this video

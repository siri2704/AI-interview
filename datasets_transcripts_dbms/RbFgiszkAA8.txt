hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I'll be covering data model shopping in dbms I will explain all these models in detail guys have uploaded a complete dbms subject tutorials I'll provide a link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started hit first you need to know what is data model for example I will go to builder in order to construct house so that at first Builder will run model of the house like where Hull is located where kitchen is located how many rooms and so on so once if I see that model I can clearly understand that how my house will look after Construction in same way before storing any data in database at first we need to create structure of database so data model is nothing but creating logical structure of database is known as data model data model gives us an idea that how the final system will look like after its complete implementation for example if you consider relational model in relational model we will show data in the form of tables like in rows and columns before actual implementation at first we need to model our data like table name how many columns that you want to insert and so on so that we can clearly understand how data will be stored after implementation data model gives us an idea that how the final system will look like after its complete implementation data model difference the data elements and the relationship between the data elements for example if you consider there is teacher and there is Department as we know teacher works for department so relationship between teaching and department is work for this teacher and Department are data elements so data model defines the data elements and the relationship between the data elements here relationship between this teacher and department is work further data models are used to show us how data is stored connected accessed and updated in database management system here we use set of symbols and text to represent the information so that the members of organization can communicate and understand it guys in data models we use symbols and as well as text in order to represent data so that members in organization can easily understand if you consider this example in this example I am using both rectangle and rhombus and I am also using texture that is teacher works for a department so we will use both symbols and as well as text once if you see this model you can easily understand so once if you see this model you can easily understand guys we call it as ER model though there are many data models being used in nowadays but relational model is the most widely user model guys there are so many data models available but among all this model relational model is based relational model is nothing but data which is stored in the form of tables guys I will explain all these models in detail at first I will explain what is hierarchical model guys this hierarchical model was faster dbms model in this model we will represent data in the form of trees in this model at first we will create root node and then we will keep on expanding this tree by adding channel to parent node at first we will create root node after that parent node and we can add multiple children's to parent node guys this hierarchical model will represent real world relationships guys this is simple example in order to represent the relationship between Shoes by using hierarchical model where the shoe is root node shoes are classified into two categories they are women shoes and men shoes women shoe contains high heels and bellies and similarly men's shoes contains sport shoes and sneakers we call this shoe as root node and we call women shoes and mentions as parent nodes and whereas this high heels bellies Sports shoe and sneakers are sale nodes Guys these are various features of hierarchical model first one is one to many relationship in a hierarchical model we will represent data in tree life structure where there exists one to many relationship like one parent can have multiple children for example if you consider many shoes as parent node this mentions can have multiple children like sports shoes and sneakers these both are multiple challenge to this parent node extra feature is Parental relationship guys in hierarchical model there can be multiple children for single parent but multiple parents for single children is not allowed for example if I write like this it is not allowed because in hierarchical model one children cannot have multiple parents so there exists only one to many relationship third one is Generation problem for example if we delete one parent node then child nodes are automatically deleted and next feature is pointers guys we call this lines as pointers pointers are nothing but their links they are used to connect parent with child these are advantages of hierarchical model guess actually in hierarchical model we will represent data entry-like structure so it is very simple and also it is very easy to Traverse and next Advantage is if you make any change to Painted node then it is automatically reflected in Shield node so it is easy to integrate data and these are disadvantages in hierarchical model first disadvantages this hierarchical model will not support complex data it is suitable only for simple data and next disadvantage is single children cannot have multiple parents that is why it will not support complex data and third disadvantage is if we delete parent node then sale node is automatically deleted these are three disadvantages in hierarchical model next I will explain Network model this network model is extension to hierarchical model in olden days before relational model this network model is widely used this network model is same as hierarchical model only difference is that in hierarchical model single child cannot have multiple parents but whereas a network model single child can have multiple parents a simple example this call is root node the scholarly contains CSC department and library there are students in CAC department and there are students in library so both nodes CSC department and library are pointing to students where this college root node and the CAC department and library are parent nodes and the student is jail node where this both parents are pointing to single child node where this is not possible in hierarchical model mixture lesson features of network model first feature is ability to merge more relationships whereas in hierarchical model there is only one to many relationship but whereas a network model there can be one-to-one relationships and as well as many to many relationships and next one is many paths as there are more relationships there can be more parts so data access is fast and simple and third feature is circular linger list a network model in order to perform various operations we use circular Linker list Next Level explain advantages of network model when compared to hierarchical model a network model we can access data very fast because there is more than one path in order to reach to particular node so we can access data in many ways there are multiple paths for particular node and there are multiple ways in order to access data and next Advantage is if we make any changes to parent node then it will effect on sale node next I will explain disadvantages of network model first disadvantage is a single child node can contains multiple parents relationship is very complex so in order to design Network model there is lot of knowledge required so Network model is complex and if you want to perform any changes to data which is present in network model it is very complex if you want to perform any operations like updation deletion insertion of data in network model then it is very complex next I will explain entity relationship model guys shortly we call this entity relationship model as ER model entity relationship model or simply ER model is a high level data model diagram guys this ER model is nothing but it is simply a data model diagram in this model we represent the real world problems in the pictorial form to make it easy for the stackholders to understand because pictorial form is nothing but diagrammatic form if we represent any problem in diagrammatic form then employees working in the organization can easily understand if any developer who want to develop any database then simply by seeing ER diagram you can understand this ER model is simply a ER diagram this ER model contains three components they are entities attributes and relationship entity is a real world thing it can be a person or place or even a concept for example if you consider in school in school there can be teachers students course building department so on all these are considered as entities next one is attributes whatever the properties that these entities contains we call this properties as attributes for example if you consider teacher is entity this teacher entity May contains various attributes like teacher name teacher salary teacher age teacher ID and so on so we call all this as attributes and third one is relationship relationship tells us that how two entities are related for example there is one entity that entity is teacher an extent it is department now what is relationship between this teacher and Department as we know teacher works for department so there is works for relationship between teacher and Department guys I will give an example for example this is showing table showing table contains student name show and rule number and section now this table name student is considered as entity and we will represent entertain rectangle so inside rectangle I return student and similarly student table contains three columns they are student name rule number and section now we call this column names as attributes and we need to represent attributes in ellipse this is another example for example there are two entities one entity is teacher an extent it is Department this teacher entity contains attributes like teacher name teacher ID Mobile number agent salary and similarly Department entity contents attributes like Department ID and Department name as you know teacher works for department so I am establishing work for relationship between teacher and department and we need to represent relationship in dramas this is simple ER model where we call this teacher name and Department as entities and teacher name teacher ID Mobile number as salary Department ID and Department name officer attributes and this works for his relationship these are features of er model first feature is graphical representation for better understanding will represent ER modeling diagrammatic format which is easy to understand so it can be used by the developers to communicate with the stakeholders for example one person came to me and he asked you to design one database then if we show ER model then you can easily understand and next feature is ER diagram ER diagram is used as a visual tool for representing the model before constructing house Builder will give us model so by saying that model we can easily understand how our house will look like after Construction in same way before designing database once you reject ER model then we can easily understand how our database will look like after implementation and next feature is database Design This model has the database designers to build the database and is widely using database design mainly we will use this ER model in database design next I will explain advantages of VR model first one is simple this ER model is very easy to build if you know relationship between attributes and entities then we can easily build ER model and next Advantage is effective communication tool you can communicate to any person by using ER model that is nothing but if any person see here model by seeing that ER model you can easily understand how database will look like after implementation so database designers will widely use this ER model and next Advantage is easy conversion to any model for example this is 20 year model where the student is entity and the student name rule number and sectional attributes now we can easily convert this ER model into relation model so we can easily convert ER model to any other models this model Maps well to the relation model and can be easily converted to relational model I already said before it is very easy to convert ER model to relation model by converting ER model to tables and not only relational model we can also convert ER model to any other models like Network model hierarchical model and so on next I will explain disadvantages of er model first one is no industry standard for notation guys there is no guarantee that all employees working in Industry can understand the CR model for example one person is an ER model but another person may not understand the CR model and next disadvantage is hidden information crisis ER model is high level data diagram high level data diagram is nothing but most of the information is hidden in ER model these are disadvantages of er model guys is hierarchical model and network model are old data models now whereas we are not at all using these models at present we are using relation model so next I will explain what is relational model relation model is most widely user model in this model data is maintained in the form of two dimensional table all the information is stored in the form of rows and columns the basic structure of relational model is tables so the tables are also called as relations in relational model that's relational model is nothing but whatever the data that is stored in the form of tables we call it as relational model tables are nothing but in rows and columns guys we also call tables as relations because we will store only related information for example if you consider employee table in employee table we will store only employee related data like employee name employee ID and so on because this is a simple example of student table we also call this stabilized relation the student table contains three columns they are short name rule number and section we also call columns as Fields both are same these two entable contains two rows they are PSI rule number 39 section A Raju remember 49 section B guys we also called rows as records or we also call it as tuples all are same don't get confused guys there are two features of relation model there rows and columns we also called Rosa similarly we also call columns as attributes or we also call columns as Fields rows contains individual information like names section A and this attributes are nothing but properties for example if your congestion table shouldn't table contains properties like show and name show and Rule Number student section show engage and so on attributes condense properties next I will explain advantages of relation model first one is simple when compared to network model and hierarchical model this relational model is very simple and next one is scalable if you want to insert new column or if you want to insert neuros then it is very easy and next Advantage is structural independency can make changes to database structure without changing the way to access data guys we can easily change structure of tables like we can insert new columns or we can insert neuros even if we insert new rows and new columns it will not affect any data which is playing in database still we can easily access our data next I will explain disadvantages of relational model first disadvantage is Hardware overheads in database will store huge amount of data so we need proper storage device and also we need powerful Hardware like high-end process next one is bad Design This relational model is very easy to design people those who are using database they don't even know how data is stored in database they simply access data for example I am student just I will check my marks in my college database but I don't know how the data is stored in database so person who is designing this database must be focused or else in future if database grows database will become slow but these two are only minor disadvantages when compared to disadvantages advantages are more in relational model if you implement relational model correctly then there will not be any problem mixture will explain object oriented data model the object oriented data model in dbms is the data model where data is stored in the form of objects guys in object-oriented data model will show data in the form of objects I'll give an example so that you can clearly understand what is this object-oriented data model this model is use it to represent real world entities for example if you consider College management system strengths faculty Department all these are considered as real world entities guys in object-oriented data model will store data and as well as data relationship in single entity and we call that entity as object in object oriented data model we can show pictures audios videos and other type of data where we consort this in relation model in relation model also we can show audios and videos but it is not recommended so if you want to share audios or videos or pictures or any other data then you can use object oriented data model guys this is simple example of object oriented data model actually the student and Department are entities but whereas in object oriented data model we call the student and Department as objects each object contains both attributes and methods attributes are nothing but properties like showing can contains name rule number phone number apartment number department number and so on we call it as attributes methods are nothing but operations what are the operations that student can perform so students will get marks students will get subjects one so all these are operations so we'll represent it as methods similarly Department can contain attributes like department number Department name Department staff department strength and so on normally we will find Department information so I will use get info method so object can contains both attributes and methods here in object oriented data model data and as well as data relationship is stored in single entity known as object the department number is common for student and department so we can establish relationship between student and Department that is nothing but student will register in particular Department next I will explain features of object oriented data model first feature is objects in object oriented data model data is represented as object just remember this object is nothing but it is instance of loss like we will show student information in student class and Department information in Department class like that we will show different information in different classes and each object contains attributes and methods so each object has its own set of attributes and methods and next feature is encapsulation here we will write implementation details and next one is inheritance object oriented data model supports inheritance which allows class to inherit attributes and methods of their parent class for example let us cancel the student is parent class now I want to create subclass like CSC students now I can create this class by inheriting attributes and methods which are present in parent class I can simply copy this attributes and methods if feature is polymorphism Parliament mini morphism in forms that mean many forms for example there are different objects in different classes now we can adapt all those objects and we can represent all those objects in single class next I will explain advantages of object oriented data model First Advantage is reusability object oriented data model promotes code reusable to throw inheritance classes can be derived from existing classes inheriting their attribution methods inheritance is nothing but process of deriving child class from parent class in order to create new class we will adapt attributes and methods from parent class next Advantage is modularity for example I want to design one complex system so simply I can divide this complex systems into sub modules so it makes easy to maintain and update the system and last Advantage is flexibility guys we can design various classes according to our requirement next I'll explain disadvantages of object oriented data model guys it is very hard to design object oriented data model and it is very complicated to use and we need to spend lot of time and lot of money so it is complex and next one is performance when compared to all other data models objective oriented data model is slow and next one is scalability scalability is nothing but capacity for example if you increase more of just in object oriented data model many problems will occur though there are many advantages there are equal disadvantages in object oriented data model So based on your project you need to choose object oriented data model next I will explain object relational model the name itself says object relational model object is nothing but object oriented data model A relational is nothing but relation model objective oriented data model supports objects classes inheritance and so on similarly in relational model will represent data in the form of tables so by combining features of these two models object relation model was created this normally in order to create database we need to use such as the query language but whereas in object relational model for example if you consider Java C plus plus python always are object oriented programming language by using this programming language itself we can create database and we can manage database we will represent data in the form of tables next I will explain flat data model in olden days when computer was first introduced we used to store our 10 flat files just inside file will create one table and will show data and there is no use of this model guys it is not a relational model but simply we will create one table inside file and we will show data and for example if any person want any information then you need to read this entire table so this flat data model is very slow and inefficient contextual data model is nothing but combination of all models whereas in associative data model we will divide data into two parts there are items and links guide this flat data model associate your data model and context data model are not important so you can ignore this and last one is semi-structure data model this semi structure data model is a data model used in dbms that allows for representation of data in a flexible hierarchical and Loosely structured manner the name itself says semi-structured will not represent data and complete structured format instead we will use semi-structured format unlike traditional relational data models where data is organized in the form of tables with predefined columns and data types semi-structure data models allows for the storage of data with varying and evolving schema guys I will give an example so that you can clearly understand what is semi-structured model for example if you consider relational model in relation model we will show data in the form of tables for example I want to show information of three different students once your name is PSI rule number 21 so I will create name column and as well as rule number column and I will insert names I and rule number 21 similarly for another student I want to insert name Ravi section A so name column is already present so you can write Ravi and section column is not present in my table so again I need to create section column and I need to write section A and similarly there is understand the student name is Raju this time I want to insert H20 so again I need to create each column here I will insert name Raju and s20 but in relational data model we need to create predefined columns that is nothing but before inserting data at first we need to create columns if you want to show details of different individuals with different attribute names then you can use semi structured model XML and Json are examples of semi-structured model for example for one student I want to show name PSI and section A and for another student I want to show name Ravi and rule number 21. so just I need to create strand names I section A guys in XML will represent data and tax anything that is written in angle brackets is known as tag so at first I open Student tag instead student tag I written name tag inside name tag I written PSI for every open tag there should be a closed tag so I took his last symbol similarly open section tag I return a and I close the section tag and I close this true and tag similarly another strand so I open strand tag inside name Ravi and rule number 21 similarly I closed this name tag rule number tag and student tag another example of semi structured model is Json which Json stands for JavaScript object notation in this we will represent data in the form of classes so we named PSI section A all our strings so take quotations and similarly another strand name Ravi rule number 21 wait 21 is integer so there is no need of taking quotations just write 21 this is semi structured model these are features of semi structured model first feature is flexibility though there are various types of data we can show data in semi structure data model for one person there is section for one person there is rule number and for one person there is age even though data is different we can show data in semi-structured model next one is hierarchical structure if you consider previous example XML and Json will show data in hierarchical format like it for student inside name section so on this is in hierarchical format and third feature is Loosely structured guys we will not show data and completely structured format instead will show data in semi-structured format so which is easy to handle data and next one is no fixer schema schema is nothing but structure the representation of data is known as schema semi-structure data model does not require any predefined schema any predefined structure is not required so Based on data we can create structure next I will explain advantages of semi-structured model First Advantage is flexibility Based on data we can change structures even though there is complex data we can handle the data so it is flexible and next Advantage is scalability semi such a data model has ability to handle complex data sets and third Advantage is easy integration as data is stored in semi-structured format we can easily integrate data integrate is nothing but combining data is very easy and last Advantage is reduced development time as data is not stored in structure to format like tables simply will show data in semi-structural format so it is very easy to develop semi-structured model guys there are two disadvantages in semi-structured model first disadvantage is query processing a different type of data is stored in semi-structured model it is very complex to write queries and next disadvantage is storage space it will occupy much space guys in exam you may also get separate questions like explain hierarchical model advantages futures of hierarchical model and so on

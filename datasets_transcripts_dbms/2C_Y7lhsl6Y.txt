hi friends in this session we are going to discuss the topic conceptual design with ER model we have already gone through many topics in dbms if you haven't gone through my dbms playlist please to go through it and don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel um now this Pro conceptual design with ER model what first we will see what is a conceptual design the process of defining a high description of the data using ER model is called conceptual design conceptual design is nothing but the representation which will be simple and which will be logical building and which will be user friendly is known as conceptual design and there are different design issues that occurs that is either to make a entity uh entity model or to attribute model or entity or relationship model or binary orary model aggregation orary model these kind of issues that occurs while preparing this conceptual design so let's see each issue in detail first we have entity versus attribute sometimes an entity of an entity set attribute of an entity set can be better represented as an entity suppose in this example employee is an entity department is also an entity the relationship between the employee and the department is work in employee Works in Department work in has two forms that is two two attributes that is from and two these from and two can be uh better to write in a separate uh entity than two this kind of representation makes it better understand the conceptual design so here uh this example can be more modified to this here it's not manages it's like work in Works in I'm sorry for this here employ duration and department or the three entities for the three entities we have three attributes and here two attributes these um these uh entity attribute representation he is represented as an entity set representation which is better to understand by the end users and it is conceptually efficient and here next we have entity versus relationship it uh sometimes an object will be better expressed as an entity rather than the uh relation what is this kind of definition is here in the below example employee is an entity and department is also an entity employee and Department are linked with with a manage relationship here as we can see manage has a sense and budget s and the budget or managed by the manager these can be managed by a manager attribute to represent and in the below example here we can see employee employee name employee and the department are the two attributes these employee two entities these employee is again forming a relationship is a relationship manager it's manager not manage manager and here we are going the going to give the two attributes s and budget to the manager as the budget and are decided by the manager and here manage relationship is formed between the employee and department so by this we can observe that it is better to express a entity rather than a relationship next we have binary versus ternary sometimes a non-binary relationship can be expressed as using distinct binary relationship consider the given ER diagram policies with the ternary relationship here in the below example employ dependent policies or the three Rel three entities that we can see here and here we are forming a relationship that is covers this is as there are three entities these can be ter as a tary relationship here in this definition we can observe that non-binary relationship can can be expressed by distinct binary relations what this term is in the this example can be modified to this here employe dependent or the two entities and policy is also an entity but here covers covers is a relation these covers relation can be subdivided into purchasers and benefits beneficiar as here uh the covers is not totally defining the binary uh relationship so uh these covers is replaced by purchase and beneficial that is they are subdivided into two types again and makes a relationship separately with the three entities this kind of problem occurs as well in the conceptual design so in the conceptual design we tend to choose these kind of tary relationships in our conceptual design next we have aggregation versus stary aggregation uh is a term that we have already seen in the previous session in the additional features of the ER model now times an ER diagram with agregation can be best either expressed as tary relation so it's better it it states said it better to represent a dinary relationship in the place of an aggregation in the example dependent monit uh project and employee or these three entities and monitor is a relationship between them and here aggregation that is a discriminator is present here as we can see here and these uh entities are represented with a relationship Monitor and as here there are three entities this is a turn relationship formed at last Next by this conceptual design we have some advantages in this sense also we have disadvantages so let's see first advantages of this conceptual representations visual representation is clear that is user can understand it better by seeing itself and serves as an excellent tool for communication uh and for the end users it will be very easy and uh interactable so that it can be modified or changed easily simplifies the process of Designing so the process which we use for conceptual models is easy as compared to the other models and errors and inconsistencies are detected easily as there are representations of the conceptually designed in a paper it is easily identified and in consistency or is also can be detected easily and adaptable to make changes in designing that is if we make any changes then it is adaptable no need to make any data structure change again that is we don't need to change the application program again next provides identification for normalization so it means conceptual design help us in the normalization process as well it also has some disadvantages in which sometimes over simplify complex relations uh what this conceptual design do is it simplifies if there is no need to simplify as well it simplifies more than uh three times the relationship which is not very essential and not very good practice and no Universal accepted standard that is it won't have any representations by itself it takes representations of the entities that is rectangles and squares only but it want maintains a standard of its own as the size of the system go grows ER diagram become difficult to manage here as the system as the system as data increases the system automat ically grow and these grow will uh this managed data is become very difficult at that level as the data is increasing too much and not designed to process complex operations like triggers procedures so the complex operations like triggers and processes in our database can't be managed by this conceptual conceptual designing okay this is all about the conceptual design with ER model in the next sessions we will so we'll see more topics in the dbms so I have already prepared a many videos on the dbms please go through go through my playlist and watch them and if you like the video don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel and please subscribe to my channel so that I get motivated to do more videos for you if you want any uh content or any uh video from Ni side please do mention in the comment session so that I'll make sure to do them for you and

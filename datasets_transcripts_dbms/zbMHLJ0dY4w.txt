[Music] hey guys this is prathi from eureka i welcome you all to this interesting session on sql basics but before we get started let's have a look at the agenda for today's session so we're gonna begin with understanding what is sql followed by that we'll be looking at what is data and database next up i shall give a detailed explanation of a table and finally i'll end the session by discussing some sql basic queries such as how to create a table how to insert data into it how to delete it and many more so i hope the agenda is clear but before moving forward i would like to request all of you to subscribe to our edureka youtube channel to never miss out an update so without any further delay let's get started so the first topic i'll be discussing in today's session is introduction to sql in today's world data is everything but to manage it one has to master the art of data management to play with the data and database we need to know the language that is understood by these databases and that language is sql sql is a core of relational type databases because of its huge popularity it is used by most companies today worldwide after understanding the basic introduction the first question that arises in our mind is what is sql sql is an abbreviation for structured query language it is a language used to perform actions such as update retrieve manipulate and store data on a relational database now that we have learned what exactly sql is let's see some of its interesting facts do you know when sql was born well let me answer that question for you sql was developed at ibm by donald d chamberlain and raymond f boyce in the early 1970s it was initially called as sql that is structured english query language but later it was chained to sql because sql was a trademark of uk-based engineering company sql is said to be a powerful language reason for that is it uses very simple english sentences and also uses very few lines it uses common words such as select insert update and many more to perform its core functionalities sql is known to be a declarative language when you write a query you have to describe what needs to be done and you don't have to worry regarding the flow of the query it will be handled internally by the dbms that you're using now let's look at some of the features of sql so the first feature is sql has well-defined standards as it says developers of sql has clearly mentioned how exactly each and every query has to be written there is no room for ambiguity when it comes to writing a query the standards has to be followed sql is easy to learn yes sql is a language that is used to work with the database since sql has a large user base as well as well-defined standards for a beginner it is really easy to learn next one is in sql we can create multiple views this is one of the unique and early feature that sql came up with view is nothing but creating a virtual table a virtual table is a temporary table for certain use by doing this we can protect the integrity of the data sql has the ability to not only create a single view but can create multiple views finally sql queries are portable in nature it means we can execute the sql query in one system and execute the same query in another system without changing the format but the condition is the environment setup of these two system has to be same as the sql query won't be executed so these were some of the features of sql now let's look at the next topic that is data and database firstly let's look at what is data so the standard definition for a data is values from differences which has been translated for some purpose and this purpose can be anything source for the data can be like temperature reading financial data videos blogs text etc it goes on in the end it should make a meaningful sense only then we can consider it as a data this image clearly depicts a different source of data so we can clearly understand that the data source can be anything since we are clear about what data is all about let's head to the next topic that is what is database firstly let's look at the formal definition for a database a database is an organized collection of data where the data is stored and accessed electronically from computer system to make you understand what it means let me use an analogy to explain the concept of database consider a library usually the library contains a huge collection of books of different genre here library is a database and these books are the data in the image we can see a person performing an action on the data and those action can be like create store update etc when the user sends the instruction as well as the data it will be stored inside the database after certain process and this entire process is bi-directional that is control flows on both the sides next i am going to talk about different types of databases there are different kinds of databases that are in use today and these databases are classified based on capabilities features functionality size and performance so few of them are distributed database object oriented database centralized database operational database graph database cloud database nosql database and finally relational database among these databases the two popular types that are widely used are first one relational database and second one nosql database relational databases generally uses sql language and we're gonna learn more about it in the coming modules moving on let's look at some of the popular databases that are widely used today so they are mongodb postgres microsoft access microsoft sql server mysql and oracle db these are the few popular databases that are used today each one of them has its own pros and cons since we have already started the topic of database it wouldn't be fair to drop this topic abruptly so i shall discuss a few basic database related queries the first query is how to create a database to explain this let me jump into mysql workbench this is the interface of mysql workbench on the left side of the screen we can see the database in the center area we are going to write our queries at the bottom part we are going to get the status of the query that has been executed so you might wonder why i am using mysql workbench for executing sql queries well sql is a language that is used to communicate with the database whereas mysql workbench is a database management system so mysql workbench allows us to use sql queries to communicate with the database can't we use other dbms yes we can but the syntax of the queries may slightly vary so let me explain you the first topic that is how to create a database and the syntax for this is create database are the keywords used to create a database followed by that we have to specify the name of the database here i'm using edureka as a name for my dbms so let me select this entire statement and click on the lightning icon so i can see at the bottom that the database with the name edureka has been created so let me refresh it so we can see that the database with the name edureka has been created so the next topic i'll be discussing is how to delete a database and the syntax for this is drop database are the keyword used to delete a database and followed by that will be the database name so let me select this entire query and click on the lightning icon so we can see that the database with the name edureka has been deleted so these were the few queries related to database the next topic that we're gonna learn is table so what is a table a table in a database is nothing but a collection of data in a tabular way it consists of rows and columns the table contains data elements also known as values using a model of vertical columns and horizontal rows the point of intersection of a row and a column is called a cell a table can have any number of rows but should have a specified number of columns to understand the concept of a table in a better way let's look at the image so the name of the table here is person when we create a table it has to have a name a table without a name doesn't exist so what is tuples a single row of a table which contains a single record for that relation here there are six tuples next is attributes features of an entity is called attribute an attribute has a name and a data type here there are four attributes those are id first name last name and date of birth so i hope you have understood the concept of table let's now understand the table constraints so what are table constraints in simple words it is a restriction that are specified by the user while creating a table so you may wonder why these kinds of constraints are required the answer for that is even though a table stores the data that data has to be of certain format to ensure the data integrity we use constraints these constraints have to be decided during the creation of a table if we want to change the constraint then we have to delete the table and then we have to create a new table using the new constraints few of the constraints that are used most of the times while creating a table are check default primary key foreign key not null index and unique since we have understood what table is let's look at some of sql queries related to the table the first one is how to create a table to understand this let's head to the mysql workbench to create a table we need an active database since we had deleted the previously create database let me create the database once again so we can see that we have a database with the name eduraka so now let me create the table and the syntax for creating a table is create table is a keyword used to create a table followed by that we have mentioned the table name we need to make sure that the table name is unique keep in mind that in a database there cannot be two tables with the same name inside the table we have declared the columns along with the data type and we have to end the query with a semicolon so let me execute this query so we can see that the table emp has been created so the next query i'm going to discuss is how to delete a table and the syntax for this is we shall use drop table keywords to delete a table and followed by that we have to specify the table name so let me select this entire query and we can see that the table with the name emp has been deleted with all the basic introduction understood so far let's now understand some sql basic queries let me begin this by introducing the most basic and widely used query that is select statement and the syntax is select column name from the table name we can specify the name of the columns that are present in the table also note that if you want to display all the columns of a table then use star operator now let's jump into execution part to explain the entire sql queries i'm using student table and this student table has student id first name last name address city and marks as its columns so the syntax for select statement is select star from student since we have to display all the columns i'm using star operator so let me select this entire query so we can see that the entire table has been displayed so this is one of the way in which we can use select statement the another method is if you want to select a particular column then we have to specify that column name and the syntax for that is so we can see that from the table we have selected only first name and last name usually select statement is used to select the data from the database so the next sql query that i'm gonna discuss is where clause where clause is used to filter records where clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill the specified condition to demonstrate where clause let me assume the scenario if i want the name of the students who are from the city goa then my where clause query will be something like this select first name from student where city is equal to goa so let me select this query and execute it so this is the output now let's look into and or not statements if we need to add two or more conditions in the where clause then we can use the above mentioned operators these keywords will add more complexity to the query so the first operator is and operator this operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by the and operator are true let's look at the syntax select columns from table where condition 1 and condition 2 has to be true to understand the example let's dive into the demo part i want to display the details of the student who has the first name as bharat and last name as singh to achieve this i'm using and operator so let me execute this query yes i got the output for the student name bharat singh the next operator i am going to discuss is or operator our operator usually displays a record if any of the condition separated by or is true and the syntax for this is select columns from table where condition 1 or condition 2 is true to understand the example let's dive into the demo i want to display the details of a student who has the first name as bhuvi or the last name as kumar to achieve this i am using or operator here any one of the condition has to be true so this is the query to execute a scenario so we have got the output for the student with the name movie kumar so let's head to the next operator that is not operator so this operator display a record if the condition or conditions are not true so the syntax is select columns from table where the condition is not true let's see how this example works here i want to display the details of the student who does not have the first name as ashok to achieve this i am using not operator in this we can see the details of all the students except ashok so the next query i'm going to discuss is insert into if we want to insert any record or data into a table then we can use insert query and the syntax for this is insert into is a keyword that is used in insert query followed by that we have to specify the table name and columns after that we have to specify the values let's look at the example to clearly understand how exactly this query works so this is the example for insert query so we are gonna insert first name as manoj last name as sharma address as 07 mg road and city as jaipur also the marks is 438 so let me execute this query so we can see that the data has been inserted to check whether the data has been inserted or not let me use select query so we can clearly see that manor sharma details has been added to the table next i'll be discussing few aggregate functions an aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on certain criteria and a single value is written we often use aggregate functions with the group by and having clauses of the select statement so we will be discussing group by having in the later part of the session some of the aggregate functions are count sum average minimum and maximum so let's discuss each one by one so the first one is count this function returns the number of rows that match specified criteria so the syntax is count of column name from table where the condition so now let's try this example in mysql workbench using this query i will calculate the number of student id that is present in the table so let me select this query in the output we can see that the count of the student id is 6. the next aggregate function is average an average function returns the average value of a numeric column so the syntax for this is select average of column from table where condition let's execute this example here i'm trying to find the average marks code by all the students so let me select this query so the average marks code by all the students is 480.333 the next aggregate function is sum usually some function returns a total sum of that particular column the syntax is select sum of column from table where condition so let me execute this example in this example i am trying to find the total marks code by all the students so let me select this query the total mark scored by all the students is 2882 moving on to the next aggregate function that is minimum minimum function will return the smallest value of the selected column and the syntax is select min of column from table where condition so let me execute this example if i want to know the student name who has scored minimum marks i'll use this query so let me select this query ashok cinna has code 385 marks and this is the minimum marks in this entire table and the last aggregate function that we are going to discuss is max max function returns the largest value from the selected column and syntax is select max of column from table where condition let's execute this example so this is the example for maximum function so let me execute this query so we get the output that is bharat singh has scored 580 marks so 580 marks is a maximum marks in the entire table next sql query is grouped by grouper is a functionality used to arrange a similar type of data into a group for instance if the column in a table consists of similar data or values in different rows then we can use group by function to group the data the syntax is select column from table where condition group by the same column let me execute this example i want to count the number of student who are from different cities if there is any student from same city then the count will be incremented at the end the output will have all the city name with the count of the students from that particular city so let me execute this query we got the count of student from different cities since all the students are from different city we can see that the count is 1 in all the cases if the data is large we can clearly get to know how effective this query is next query is having this clause is used to place condition where we need to decide which group will be part of the final result set the having clause was added to sql because the where keyword could not be used with aggregate function such as sum count min max etc so the syntax is select column from table where condition grouped by the column and having condition so let me execute this example in my sql workbench so that you'll get an idea about having clause from the table if i want to display the students who have scored more than 500 then i'll specify that condition after having keyword so let me execute this query so we can see that there are two students ashok and bhuvi who have scored more than 500 marks moving on to the next query that is order by order by keyword is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order this keyword is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order the order by keyword shall sort the record in ascending order by default if we want to sort the record in descending order then we need to use the descending keyword so let me explain the syntax select columns from table order by columns either by ascending or descending let me execute this example in this example we will get the count of students from different city and we are arranging the city in descending order so let me execute this query we can see that the cities are arranged in descending order based on the starting alphabet the next sql query that we're gonna learn is null values in sql we use the null term to represent a missing value a null value in a table is a value that appears to be blank a field with a null value is a field with no value in sql keep note that a null value doesn't mean that the value is equal to 0. to check the null value we are not supposed to use the operator such as greater than less than equal to these operators are not supported in sql we have special keywords those are is null and is not null first let's look at the is null operator is null operator is used to test the empty values and the syntax for this is select columns from table where column is null so let me execute this example i want to display the student's name whose marks is null so let me select this query and let me execute this since all the students have marks and none of them has null value in the output we don't have any student names the next query is is not null the is not null operator is used to test for non-empty values and the syntax is select column from table where column is not null so again let me execute this example i want to display the student names whose marks is not null so let me execute this query since all the students have marks all the student names are displayed let's move to the next query that is update generally the update command is used to modify rows in a table the update command can be used to update a single field or multiple fields at the same time let's look at the syntax for update statement update table set column equal to value where condition let's execute this example here i want to change the name of the student with student id 1. previously the student with student id 1 was ashok sinha now i want to change his name to amar kumar so let me execute this query so we can see that the student name has been updated to check the student table let me execute this query and we can see that the name of student id 1 has been changed from ashok sinha to amar kumar the next query we are going to discuss is delete the sql delete command is used to delete rows that are no longer required from the database tables it deletes the whole row from the table the syntax is delete from table where condition so let me execute this example if we want to delete a record from student table where the city is mumbai let me execute this query so we can see that the query has been executed to check the table let me execute the statement and student with the id 1 has been deleted next let's discuss in and between operators in operator is used to specify multiple values inside the where clause it acts as multiple or let's look at the syntax select column from table where column in value let me execute this example if we want to display the record of a student who are from certain city then we can use inoperator in the given example let's display the name of the students along with their ids who are from delhi goa pune and bengaluru let me execute this query in the output only those students from the specified city name are displayed the next operator is between between operator will select a particular value within the specified range it is compulsory to add the beginning and the end value let us look at the syntax select column from table where column name between value 1 and value 2. let's execute this example if we want to display the record of students whose marks are in certain range then we can use between operator in the given example let's display the name of the student along with their id who has scored in the range of 400 and 500 so let me execute this query in the output only those student records who have scored in the range of 400 and 500 has been displayed so the next topic we're going to cover is aliases in sql alias is a process of giving a table or a column a temporary name so that it helps when the query is complex it increases the readability of the query this renaming is temporary and the table name does not change in the original database we can alias a column or a table so the first concept is column aliasing and the syntax is select column name as alias name from table so let me execute this example in the student table the column name student id is bit long when we write a nested query we might face some trouble in order to tackle such situation that alias that student id column as id so let me execute this query and we can see that the column student id has been alias to id next is table aliasing now let's look at the syntax for table alias and the syntax is select column from table as alias name so let's execute this example we generally use as keyword in aliasing so let me execute this query by using the technique of table aliasing i have displayed the names of the students from the student table so that was the basic concept of sql so that's all for today's session i hope you found this session interesting and informative hope you have understood what is sql data database table and some basic sql queries i hope you guys had a lot of fun while executing the queries so that's all from my side today thank you and have a great day i hope you have enjoyed listening

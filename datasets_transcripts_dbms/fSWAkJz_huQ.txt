[Music] hello guys welcome you all to this new video today we will simplify the concepts of database and DBMS so let's start the video database is about data so before we see what databases we will see what is data data is simply information about something like for example your name your age your height your weight mobile number etc so basically this is information about you that means this is data about you let us consider another example say mobile soap company who built the mobile price of the mobile mobile model name information about storage battery backup processor etc so this all is the data about the mobile data can be in many formats like numbers texts pictures audio video etc so now we will see what is a database the definition states that database is a collection of related data stored electronically in a systematic manner so let's simplify the definition it is a collection of related data that means if we consider a college there will be data of courses teachers students etc which will be related to each other there will be a particular teacher teaching a particular course to students there will be students taking different course so to make a database of a college we need to collect all the data about courses teachers students etc which will be interrelated with each other stored electronically in computer system this means data is stored in computer system in electronic manner it is stored in data servers for example before we had to fill a paper form and submit it by going to the college nowadays you need to fill an online form to apply in a college that means your data filled in online form is stored electronically in college database in a systematic manner in database data is stored or arranged in systematic manner data is stored in tables in row and column format data is not stored anyhow let us see one example of database so in this example we have considered a small database of a company there are two tables present in it one is department table and another one is an employee table these are the attributes of the table for example if we make a table of students then roll number name class division will be its attributes these are the rows of table each row is one individual record these are the columns of the table one individual record in table is also called as tuple now we will see what is DBMS DBMS is database management system so basically it is a system used to manage the database we users interact with the database with DBMS when you have a database you need to manage it like you need to insert data update the existing data delete unwanted data you need to make sure who has access to the data this is all done by using the DBMS that is database management system control access with DBMS we can decide who can access the data and how much of data can someone access for example if there is a college database then each student must have access to only his or her own data on other hand teacher can have access to all students data this can be managed through DBMS manipulate data if we want to insert new data or update existing data or delete unwanted data or any other operation on the database we can perform using DBMS of data the data stored in the database is very well defined using DBMS so we saw what is database and database management system in this video if you have any queries or suggestions comment below [Music]

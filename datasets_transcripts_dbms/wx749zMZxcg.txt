Hello friends welcome back to our Channel Tech India this is lecture 10 for the series dbms for exams and placement let's start with our topic that is entity relationship model entity relationship model is a model for identifying entities like students car or company to be represented in the database and representation of how these entities are related the ER data model is specify Enterprise schema that represents overall logical structure of a database graphically symbols used in ER model ER model is used to model The Logical view of the system from a data perspective which consist of these symbols rectangles rectangles represent the entities in the ER model ellipses elipses represent the attributes in the ER model diamond diamond represents the relationship among the entities lines represent attributes to entities and entity sets with other relationship types double ellipses double ellipses represent multivalued attributes double rectangle double rectangle represents a weak entity you will be able to understand or get the summary of this complete discussion over here these are the figure names rectangle Els Diamond line double ellipse double rectangle and this is the representation of them if rectangle is there entities in the a model ellipse attributes in the ER model Diamond relationship among entities line attributes to entities and entity sets with other relationship types double ellipse multivalued attributes double rectangle weak entity this is the summary of the discussion that we have done as of now now components of ER diagram ER diagram consist of entities attributes relationship among entities in a database system here is the ER model you will be able to understand here ER model it will have entity attribute relationship then entity will be of two types a strong entity weak entity attribute will be key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute derived attribute Now relationships one to one one to many many to one many to many these are the things going to help to create and understand ER diagram now what is entity entity may be an object with physical existence a particular person car house or employee or it may be an object with conceptual existence a company a job or a university course what is entity set an entity is an object of entity type and a set of all entities is called an entity set for example E1 is an entity having entity type is student and the set of all student is called entity set now types of entity there are two types of entity a strong entity weak entity now what is a strong entity a strong entity is a type of entity that has a key attribute a strong entity does not depend on another entity in the SCH schema it has a primary key that helps in identifying it uniquely and it is represented by a rectangle these are called strong entity types now weak entity an entity type has a key attribute that uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set but some entity type exist for which key attribute can't be defined these are called weak entity type for example a company May store the information of dependents like parents children spouse of an employee but the dependents can't exist without the employee so dependence will be a weak entity type and employee will be identifying entity for the dependent which means it is a strong entity type so let me explain it to you suppose he is an employee and these are dependents father mother children and this employee is working obviously in an organization employee is related to the organization right so employee is an strong entity for the organization but these dependents are weak entity because these are there because this employee is there so employee is a strong entity and these are are weak entity I hope this is clear to you now a weak entity type is represented by a double rectangle the participation of weak entity types is always total the relationship between the weak entity type and its identifying strong entity type is called identifying relationship and it is represented by Double Diamond what is attributes attributes are properties that Define The Entity type for example role number name do OB age address and mobile number are the attributes that Define The Entity type student in our diagram the attribute is represented by an oval you can see here this is attribute and it is represented by oval now types of attributes key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute derived attribute now key attribute the attribute which uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set is called the key attribute for example role number will be unique for each student in ER diagram the key attribute is represented by an o with underlying lines you can see here it is role number with underlying line in the oval now composite attribute an attribute composed of many other attribute is called an composite attribute for example the address attribute of the student entity type consist of a street city state and Country in ER diagram the composite attribute is represented by an oval comprising of ovals here is address which is composite attribute composed by Street city state country which are further again attributes and are represented by oval itself now multivalued attribute an attribute consisting of more than one value for a given entity for example forone number in diagram a multivalued attribute is represented by double O you can see here for number it is represented by double O now derived attribute an attribute that can be derived from other attributes of the entity type is known as a derived attribute example age it can be derived from do in your diagram the derived attribute is represented by Dash tol you can see here AG is represented by Dash to the complete entity type student with its attribute can be represented as here so entity is student its composite attribute is address which comprises of country state city state its unique attribute is role number further attributes are name do phone number phone number is represented by double LS because it can be multivalued because he can have two or three phone numbers and age is represented by Dash to because it can be derived from the do so it is derived attribute so friends this was all in this video I hope you were able to understand the ER diagram thanks for watching this video have a great learning

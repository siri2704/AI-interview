in this video let us learn to draw an er diagram for the topic employee management system so what are all the entities before choosing the entities you should know what is an entity entity is nothing but an object an object which is conceptually existing or physically existing so in employee management system definitely an employee will be there this employee is an entity because employee is an object an employee is a person so it is physically existing person is physically existing so therefore employee is an entity entity must be written inside the rectangular box so i should draw a rectangular box and write the entity name inside that box so employee is the entity name the next entity is domains now for example if the employee belongs to an iep field then in that there will be many languages like java c sharp and many more so domain means that language language is only domain java c sharp those are all the domains so some person some employee belongs to java domain some employee belongs to c-sharp domain so that is the meaning for this domain next project so if you take this domain this domain is not physically existing it is conceptually existing so therefore this is also an object and it is an entity next project project is also not physically existing it is conceptually existing but still it is an entity next is salary salary is also conceptually existing and not physically existing so these are all the entities employee domain project and salary are the four entities so entities must be written inside the rectangular box next is attribute attribute means characteristics of the entity so attribute must be written inside the oval shape so employee employee will have a name so employee is a person so every person is having a name so employee will have a name next employee will have a gender whether the employee is male or female next employee will have an employee id employee id must be underlined because it is a primary key now for example if a person if an employee's employee id is 3 that same number 3 will not be an employee id for any other employee it is going to be unique for every employee that is the reason why employee id is a primary key and i have underlined it next is date of joining date of joining can be an attribute of employee next domain what are all the attributes of domain domain will have a name i already gave examples domain can be java c sharp all those are the names next is the domain id domain id will also be unique for every batch for the batch belonging to java domain they will be having a unique id the domain which is for c sharp will have a different domain id so it is going to be unique for every domain so i need to underline that and domain id is the primary key next project project will also have a name project will have a name and project will also have a project id project id is going to be a primary key because project id will be unique so i need to underline that so now for example for one project if the id is ab21 that same id will not be assigned to any other project next salary [Music] salary means you will be having increment as an attribute then you will also be having the basic pay now if you're going to join in an organization they'll tell in the start itself that this is going to be your basic pay 30 000 is going to be your salary so that is your basic thing increment is every year you know some increment will be given for example if the basic is 30 000 and the increment for every year is thousand then it is going to be 31 000 as the increment so after every month thousand rupees will be incremented to you so these are all the attributes of salary now we need to connect all the entities so relationship is an operator which is going to connect all the entities so i need to draw a diamond box diamond box is only the relationship now i need to write something inside the diamond box it can be a warp so employee works in so employee works in some domain if the domain okay works in some domain and in that domain projects will be given so that domain has projects and if the project is done you will be paid that is the salary will be given so employee will work under some domain and in that domain projects will be assigned to the employee and if the employee has completed the project successfully the salary will be given to the employee so this is the flow if you like this video please like subscribe and share it with your friends thank you

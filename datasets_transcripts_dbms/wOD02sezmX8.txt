[Music] hello everyone and welcome to the course of dbms in this video we're going to look into the basic concepts of entity relationship model or otherwise called the er model so basically in this video we will be looking into few important terminologies in relation to the er model the entity relationship model or the er model describes data as entities attributes and relationships in this video we will be mainly focusing on entities and attributes and in the later videos we will be looking into the concept of relationships now what is an entity it is a thing in the real world with an independent existence that is it is a thing or an object that has its own identity or that can be identified easily an entity may be an object with physical existence like for example a house person an employee etc or it can be objects with a conceptual existence like for example course job etc so this is what an entity is next let us see what attributes are attributes are properties that describe the entities for example if i have an entity person the properties that would describe this particular entity would be name age address phone number etc so these are called as attributes of this entity in our further videos we will learn about each of the symbols that we have used here and also all the other symbols that we use in the er diagram now let's look into the several types of attributes in the er model with examples first let us see what composite attributes and simple attributes are composite attributes are attributes that can be divided into further parts whereas simple attributes are attributes that cannot be divided further an example of a composite attribute is name this attribute can be divided into further parts first name middle name and last name an example of a simple attribute is weight this attribute cannot be further divided other examples could be salary a person's age etc so this is about composite and simple attributes next we have the single valued attributes and multi-valued attributes single valued attributes are attributes that have a single value or just one value for a particular entity whereas multi-valued attributes are attributes that can have a set of values for a particular entity an example for a single valued attribute is age a particular person can have only a single value for this particular attribute so age is a single valued attribute of a person examples of multi-valued attributes are college degree languages known etc a particular person can have more than one college degree and can also know more than one language since these attributes can have a set of values for a particular entity it is called as a multi-valued attribute of a person so these are about single valued attributes and multi-value attributes next let us see what derived attributes and stored attributes are derived attributes are attributes that can be derived from other attributes whereas stored attributes are attributes from which the value of other attributes are derived an example of a derived attribute is age since age can be derived from date of birth this is called a derived attribute whereas date of birth or birth date of a person is a stored attribute because from this attribute we can derive age of a person so this is a stored attribute from which the value of other attributes are derived next let us see what are complex attributes a complex attribute has multi-valued and composite components in it we have already seen earlier in this video what multi-valued and composite attributes are so a complex attribute has both multivalued and composite components here in the complex attribute a multi-valued attribute is represented within curly brackets and composite attributes are represented within round brackets or paranthesis this is an example of a complex attribute here college degrees which is represented within curly brackets is a multi-valued attribute because one person can have more than one degree and within the parenthesis is the composite attribute so this is about complex attributes next we're going to learn about null values null is something which is not applicable or unknown so when does null value mean not applicable in some cases an entity might not have an applicable value for an attribute like for example if i have an attribute college degree this attribute applies only to persons with a college degree or if i have an attribute say the landline number this attribute again applies only to persons who has a landline so a person who has no college degree will have null for the attribute college degree and a person who has no landline phone will have null for the attribute landline number so in this particular case the meaning of null is not applicable null can also be used when we don't know the value of an attribute like for example if we don't know the phone number of a particular entity here say jeremy then that particular value of the attribute would be null so in this case the meaning of null is unknown the unknown category of null can be further classified into two cases the first case is when the value exists but it is missing like for example the age of joshua exists but it is missing so that value would be null the second case is when it is not known if the value exists or not like for example if you don't know whether the student jeremy has a phone number or not in that case the value of the attribute phone number would be null hope you understood what null values are the next terminology that we are going to learn is entity type what is entity type it is a collection of entities that have the same attributes example of an entity type is student so here each record in this table is an entity we have harry jeremy and joshua as the entities these entities share the same attribute that is age and they belong to the entity type student so an entity type is a collection of entities that have the same attributes now what is an entity set it is a collection of entities of a particular entity type at a point in time if i say i need students whose age is between 19 and 23 so at that particular point in time all the students with age between 19 and 23 is an entity set next let us see what a key attribute is a key attribute of a particular entity type is that attribute that is capable of identifying each entity uniquely for example role number of a student now in this table with entity type student i have two students with the same name and also the same age if i have to identify this particular student uniquely i can identify her by her student id or role number because no two students can share the same role number in a particular class so the attribute role number or student id is a key attribute to identify a student uniquely next what is value set of attributes value set of attributes is a set of values that can be assigned to a particular attribute for example if the range allowed for the age of an employee is between 22 and 60 then we can specify the value set of the age attribute of an employee as a set of integer numbers between 22 and 60. so that is called as a value set so these are the few important terminologies that we need to know in relation to the er model with this we come to the end of this video hope you have understood the definition of each of these terminologies thank you [Music] you

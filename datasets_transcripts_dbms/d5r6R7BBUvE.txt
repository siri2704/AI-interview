hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I'll be covering complete unit to in dbms subject guys I will explain all these topics in detail and whatever the topics that I'm going to cover in this video I will provide all those topics and the timings in description so before starting this video please check in description guys I have uploaded a complete dbms update tutorials I'll provide a link in description you can watch from there I also provided you need to study material Link in description you can download from description if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started at first I will explain what is relational model in dbms EF chord is a person who developed relation model in 1970s gas relation model is nothing but database which shows data in the form of tables that is in the form of rows and columns is known as relational model so relational model can be represented as a table with columns and rows for example it is console there is college database inside College database there is student table guys we also call the student table as relation the student is nothing but table name or you can also call this table name as relation why we call it as relation because if you consider the student table in this student table we will show only student related information like student name student rule number and student section for example it is considered there are two tables by using primary key and foreign key I can relate these two tables that is nothing but I can connect with two tables that is why we call this table name as relation so you can call this to enter stable or you can also call it as relation whereas this name rule number and section are column names and also call this column names as fields or you can also call them as attributes all are SIM for example if you consider name column you can also call this name column as name field or you can also call it as name attribute all are same don't get confused for example if you consider name PSI rule number 121 and section A this is one row so we call it as row so we can also call this row as Tuple or we can also call this row as record so names are rule number 121 and section A it is considered as row R Tuple or record all are same each column is known as field or attribute these are advantages of relational model first one is simple when compared to all models relational model is very simple because if you know SQL that is structured query language you can easily use this relational model and next one is accuracy whatever the data that is present inside relational model all those data will be correct because relational model will not allow duplicate values and all those data is in will organize the format so accuracy is one of the advantage and next Advantage is security relational model contains various access permissions and also we can keep password to our database so only authorized users can access database that is why this relational model is secure and last Advantage is flexible flexible is nothing but we can easily insert data update data delete data in database that is why this relational model is flexible and acceleration disadvantages of relational model in order to use relational database you need High audible support like you need high-end Ram processor hard disk Etc otherwise it will cause Hardware problems and this relational model is not suitable for large databases these are disadvantages of relational model relational model or explain relational database whenever these questions come in exam you can write this answer next I will explain database language Topic in dbms guess normally if you want to communicate with any person directly you can communicate in English language or Hindi language or any other language but database software cannot understand our language so in order to communicate with database software we need database language total there are four categories of database language they are data definition language shorter we call it as gdl data manipulation language shortly we call it as DML transaction control language TCL and data control language DCL I will explain all these Languages by giving various examples guys we also call database language as query languages or data query language or SQL languages all are same database language are nothing but their programming language the developers use to interact with databases by using this language database developers can perform various operations on database like they can Define data they can access data they can update data and so on in databases there are various DPMS softwares that use various database languages in order to perform various operations on database and then one of the popular database language is SQL this SQL is one of the standard programming language for managing database softwares MySQL Microsoft SQL server and Etc all the software is use SQL so it is considered a standard programming language these are four categories of database language it first of all explain what is data definition language shortly we call it as gdl guys data definition language is used to define structure or database defining structure is nothing but creating tables columns Etc guys I will give one simple example so that you can clear alienation what is use of this data definition language for example by using data definition language I created College database inside College database I created student table inside showing table I inserted three columns they are name rule MRI section for example I want to insert data like name PSI rule number 21 and section A but we cannot insert data by using data definition language we can only different structure of database that is nothing but by using data definition language we can only create database we can create table and we can create columns but we cannot insert data so the name itself says data definition language that is nothing but defining only structure of database but we cannot insert data or we cannot delete data structure is nothing but creating database creating strain table and creating columns all this comes under structure of database these are various commands in data definition language I will explain all these commands by giving examples at first I will explain what is use of create command browsing create command we can create objects in database objects are nothing but by using this create command we can create tables and as well as columns not only tables and columns by using this create command we can also create database at first I will explain how to create database and how to delete database guys whenever you open your database software first thing you need to do is you need to create database by using Create command we can create database so this is syntax in order to create database so in order to create database it first you need to write create database and here you need to give your database name this is syntax for example I want to create College database so in order to create College database you need to write statement like create database here I want to give database name as college so just write your college so just write your create database college and the class give semicolon guys definitely at last gives semicolon or else it will display error so whenever you write this statement and click enter it will create College database now in my database software College database is created just now we created College database now we will check whether College database is created or not in order to check whether College database is created or not just we need to write statement that is show databases and give semicolon guys definitely you must try it here show databases not show database because in database software not only single database there will be multiple databases so definitely right here show databases and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter you will get output it will display all databases present in my database software so there is only one database that is college database so it will display College database now inside this college database I want to create student table and this stream table must contain three columns they are name rule number and section I will write code in order to create student table in order to create Schwinn table inside this college database at first you need to write use College where college is my database name whenever you write your use college now whatever the tables that we create all these tables are stored in college database so definitely right use college now we will create student table so just right here create in order to create student table you need to use create command so just write your create table and I want to give table name as student so just write your student Open Bracket now inside the student table I want to create three columns one column is name next column is rule number and next column is section so First Column name is name so just write your name which is column name and here you need to give data type normally we will give names like nagendra Sai Shiva so one all are character data types so you need to write a data type that is VR care where varker stands for variable character and inside bracket you need to give size for example if you consider name Psi Psi is of three characters one two three for example if you consider Shiva one two three four five total five characters now I want to give limit that is size 50 which I is three characters Shiva is five characters like this each name can contain up to 50 characters comma next to column is rule number so just write a rule number guys just remember that we should not give any space between these column names and here you need to give data type for example I want to give rule numbers like rule number one two three ten so one so you need to write here data type that is int in order to enter numbers you need to write data type that is int comma next column is section so just write your section and here you interview data type I want to give section like section A B C so one so all are single characters so you need to give data type that is where care for example I will give your size 10 that means this section column will support up to 10 characters we open bracket now we need to close this bracket and give semicolon guys definitely give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter it will create student table with three columns name rule number and section now we created student table inside College database now I want to check whether table is created or not in order to check whether table is created or not you need to write code that is show tables and give semicolon whenever you write your show tables it will display all tables which is Prime in my college database just now we created only one table so whenever you write your short tables I will get output that is student because there is only one table in my college database whenever you write show databases it will display all databases which is run in my database software whenever you write your show tables it will display all tables which is in my particular database for example there are 10 tables in my college database so whenever I write your show tables it will display complete names of all 10 tables which is Prime in my college database I don't want to save only table name I want to see all columns which is present in my stream table so for that purpose you need to write code that is describe here you need to use describe command I want to see all columns which is present table so just write describe student and give semicolon whenever you write this code this is my output it will display all three columns name rule M run section instead of writing describe you can also use shortcut that is desc desc student whenever you write desc student this is my output it will display all columns which is presentation table next I will explain what is use of drop command whereas create command is used to create database objects like databases tables Etc and whereas drop command is used to delete database objects like databases tables Etc we created student table now I want to delete this showing table so in order to delete student table you need to write code that is drop table and here you need to give table name my table name is Trend so just write here drop tables ruined guys all are small letters drop table strength and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter it will delete my screen table for example I want to delete complete database so in order to delete complete database you need to write drop database and here you need to give database name for example I want to delete College database so just I drop database College so whenever you write this code and click enter a complete database will be deleted guys for example my college database total 10 tables so whenever I write this code my database and as well as 10 tables will be deleted this is all about drop command next I will explain what is use of rename command rename command is used to rename existing table for example there is to end table now I want to change the name strain to students in order to change name from student to students you need to use rename command so just write here rename all our small letters guys not only small address you can also use capital letters so just idea rename table and here you need to give World Table name my world table name is student so just write your student to new table name I want to change name strain to students so just write Assurance the name table World Table name to new table name whenever you write this code and click enter it will change name from student to students now my table name insurance by using rename command we can only rename tables we cannot name databases semicolon is mandatory next of action what is use of truncate command this truncated command is used to remove all data which is planned in my table for example the ratio and table in this showing table there is some data like name PSI rule number one section A name Shiva rule number two section B and name Ramesh rule number transaction C now I don't want to delete table and I don't want to delete columns just I want to remove all this data which is present in my table further purpose we need to use truncate command so just write here truncate table and give table name my table name is showing so just write your student whenever you write this code and click enter my table will look like this it will remove all data which is planned in my table this is use of truncate command truncate command will not delete table and columns just it will delete complete data which is run in my table till now I explain what it is of create command drop command translate command and rename command Next Generation what is use of alter command guys we will apply alter command only on columns alter is nothing but modify by using this alter command we can modify structure of existing database objects like tables columns Etc guys by using order command we can perform various operations on columns these are four basic operations that we can perform on columns by using this order command by using order command we can add columns we can modify columns we can rename column names and also we can delete columns I will explain all these operations by giving examples hit first I will explain how to add new column by using alter command for example there is showing table this shown table there are three columns name rule number section now I want to add one new column that is H I want to add each column to this table so just write here alter table and my table name is joint so alter table shouldn't add column here column name I want to add age column so just right here age will give Edge like 12 13 20 Etc so I'll give data type that isn't alter table table name add column column name and data type and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter it will add one new column that column name is H to the student table and this age column data type isn't I want to check whether column is created or not so just right here describe and my table name is joint whenever you write description it will display this output you can see new column with name Edge by using alter add you can add new column for example for age column a given data type in but I change in my mind this time I want to change this data type to where Captain for example I want to give data like on E1 if IVF I like that so now I need to change this H column data type as worker so for that purpose you need to use alter modify where alter modify is used to modify data type of existing column so just write your alter table and table image trend so alter table table name my table name is Trend modify column I want to change data type of each column so just write here a column name that is age and here you need to give new data type here I want to give new data type that is very care and I want to give size up to 50 and give semicolon alter table table name modify column column name that is Edge and give data type whenever you write this code and click enter it will change my data type worker my column name is H now I want to change this column name to my age for that purpose we need to use alter rename so further purpose you need to write alter table table emission student rename column my old column name is H so rename column old column name to new column name that is my age there is no way of giving data type just write here alter table table name rename column old column name to new column name that is my age whenever you write this code and click enter it will change name from age to my age and last one is drop I want to delete this my Edge column so just write alter table table name is student drop column my column name is my age so just right here my Edge and it lasts use semicolon alter table table name drop column column name so whenever you write this line of code and click enter my age column is removed now there are only three columns guys in exam you may get separate question about alter command so write this four operations in exam this is all about ddl commands next I will explain what is use of DML commands guess normally by using data definition language we can only Define structure of database that is nothing but creating database tables and columns but we cannot insert or update or delete data by using data definition language so in order to insert update delete or retrieve data we need to use data manipulation Language by using data manipulation language we can perform various operations on data which is present in my table by using data manipulation language we can interact and we can manipulate data which is stored in database we can perform various operations like inserting updating deleting and retrieving data these are various commands that we use in data manipulation language insert command in order to insert data update command in order to update data and delete command in order to delete data and whereas select command is used to see output it first I'll explain what is use of insert command for example there is college database inside College database there is student table student table contains three columns they are name rule number transaction now I want to insert data in this table I want to insert name like name PSI rule number 21 and section A name Shiva rule number 22 section B and name nagendra rule number 23 and section c in order to insert this data you need to write code that is here you need to use insert command insert into here interview table name in which table you want to insert data I want to insert data instrument table suggested insert into student insert into student values I want to insert three records first record is names are your rule number 21 and section A so just open bracket names I when name is I in quotations comma rule number 21 21 is integer type so there is no enough using quotations just try 21 and section A where section is where data type so use quotations close this bracket comma next record is Shiva so Shiva in quotations comma 22 comma section bin quotations close bracket comma third record is name nagendra rule number 23 and section c so again Open Bracket name nagendra in quotations comma 23 comma C in quotations and close this bracket and give semicolon whenever you write this code it will insert this three records inside this student table guys First Column is name next column is rule number and next column is section so you need to insert data accordingly that is it first write name next rule number and next one is section this is how we insert data by using insert command now I want to see this entire table as output so in order to see this entire table as output you need to use select command so just right here select star star is nothing but it will display completable star from my table name is Trend so just write here select star from student and give semicolon so this is my output guys just remember the Starman complete columns so it will display all these three columns as output so this is my output Starman complete columns but I don't want this complete column as output just I want to see name column as output so for that purpose you need to write select so just write your select a name from student so it will display only name column as output so this is my output I want to see name column and rule them or column as output so for that purpose you need to write selector name comma rule number from shrend whenever you write select name comma rule number from show end it will display output name and as well as rule number columns this is my output for example now I want to change name PSI to name Ganesh in order to change any data which is found in my table you need to use update command so just right here update and table name I want to update data which is presenting student table so just write here update student set name equal to meaning of this code is it will change the name Ganesh whose rule number is 21 here sorry roll number is 21. so it will change name from PSI to Ganesh for example I want to change this nagendra section as section D not C I want to change the section c to D so for that purpose you need to write update student sit I want to change section from C to D so just write your section equal to DN quotations where rule M are equal to 23 meaning of this code is it will change section to D whose rule number is 23 here nagendra rule number is 23 so it will update data to section D now I want to check whether data is updated or not in order to check whether data is updated or not you need to write code that is Select star from student based arm and complete columns it will display all these three columns as output whenever you write this code and click enter it will display all columns from student table so this is my output If You observe this table in this table it changes names I to Ganesh and section c to D this is how we update data next I will explain how to delete data now I want to delete complete record of student whose rule number is 21. so just you need to use delete command delete from student which is table name where role number equal to 21 yes I rule number is 21 whenever you write this code and click enter it will delete complete record of student whose rule number is 21 so it will delete this entire record now I want to check whether record is deleted or not so for that purpose you need to write select star with Starman complete columns from table name shouldn't whenever you write this code and click enter it will display complete student table and you can see only two records because sorry record is deleted output this is how we delete data by using delete command by using insert command we can insert data by using update command we can update data by using delete command we can delete data by using select command we can retrieve data that is nothing but we can see output guys we also call this electric command as data query language now I will explain in detail about the select command guys we also call this electric command as data query language meaning of queries question by using select a command we are questioning to our database for example I want to see compassion table as output so for that purpose we need to write select so just select star Starman complete columns from table name my table name is Trend so just right here select start from student and give semicolon that means I am questioning my database to provide complete showing table as output so query is nothing but question by using select command We can question to our database that is why we call this electric command as data query language guys in exam you may get separate question like explain querying relational data so whenever querying relational data or select command or data query language question comes in exam then you need to explain in detail about the select command whenever you write select star from show end this is my output Starman complete columns but I don't want complete table I just want only name column and Rule Number column as output so whenever you write here select name comma rule number from student it will display only data which is present in name column and Rule Number column so whenever you write select name comma rule number from show end it will explain only these two columns as output this is my output I don't want all these records I just want only PSI record Psy rule number is one so just a written here select star star Min complete three columns it will display PSI rule number one and H20 from schwind here for condition you need to give Veer where rule number equal to 1 this is my output it will display name PSI rule number one and H20 for example I just want only age of student whose rule number is 1 so in place of writing star just you need to give h select H from student where rule number equal to one so it will display only is that is 20. for example I want record of student whose rule number is 3 so just you need to write select to start from student where roll number equal to 3 it will display complete record of student whose rule number is three so it will display complete Ramesh record you can apply multiple conditions by using and so just say written here select star Starman complete columns from student where age is greater than 12 and age is less than 21. If You observe this table age is 18 AC 18 is greater than 12 and less than 21. 19 is greater than 12 and less than 21 accepted PSI is 20 20 is greater than 12 and less than 21 accepted and next 21 21 is greater than 12 but 21 is not less than 21 21 equal to 21 so this is not accepted and similarly 22 22 is greater than 12 but 22 is not less than 21 22 is greater than 21 so this is not accepted so whenever I write select to start from student where age is greater than 12 and age is less than 21 it will display output names I rule number 120 name Suresh rule number 419 name rajes Rule Number 5 and 18 by using and we can give multiple conditions next I written here select star from student where age in 20 comma 30 comma 40 first one is 20 is 20 is present PSI age is 20 so it is accepted and next 30 that is not present in the stable and next one is 40 H Fort is not present in a stable only H20 is present so I'll get output name PSI rule number one and H20 this is my output it will display all these three columns because I return your star star in all columns next I written here select star from student where I selected name column like s percentage in quotations guys whenever you write s percentage in quotations meaning of this is in name column starting letter must be s and remaining all letters are accepted so whenever I write your selected start from student where name like s percentage it will display three records as output they are PSI Shiva and Suresh this is my output next I written here selected star from student where name like first time I written its percentage that means starting letter must be S this time I return here percentage a that means sorting any letters are accepted but last letter must be a If You observe this table lasted array not accepted and for sure last letter is a so it is accepted and H H these three are not accepted so whenever I write here select start from student where name like percentage in quotations it will display output that is name Shiva rule number 2 and h21 this is my output for example I written select a star from student order Space by age that mean it will display screen table as output according to order of H from small topic if you see this age column in this age column 18 is small so at first it will display Rajesh 518 and next 19 is small so Suresh 419 after the PSI 120 after the Shiva 221 and it lasts Ram is 322 this is my output whenever you write yourself from student order by age it will arrange age column in ascending order for example I want to arrange this H column in descending order that is from Big to small so just right here selects short from student order by age space DAC that is descending order enter so it will display data in descending order according to each this is all about select command next I will explain TCL that is transaction control language the name itself says transaction control language so this transaction control language is used to manage transactions within a database there are two commands in TCL they are commit and rollback I will explain these two comments by giving examples guys for example there is college database inside College database there is student table this is showing table data now in the show end table I want to change names I to name Ganesh now I will perform this operation by using transaction control language transaction and give semicolon my student table is present in college database so it was you need to use College database so write use college now in the student table I want to change the name sorry to namekanish so just you need to use update command so just right here update and table name I want to update data which is Prime and student table so just write update student set name equal to Ganesh way rule number equal to 1 meaning of this code is it will change name to Ganesh whose rule number is 1. here in this table PSI rule number is one so it will change name from PSI to Ganesh guys whenever you start any transaction for each and every operation you need to use commit so after performing this operation you need to write commit only after writing your Commit This operation will be permanently stored in our database that is it will change name from PSI to Ganesh and this information is permanently stored in database only after writing commit for example I return this code but I did not return here commit and I closed my software once if you close your software without writing commit then this information will not be stored in our database that is it will not change name to Ganesh because we did not return here commit so if you write commit whatever the operations that you perform on database that operations will be stored permanently in our database so whenever you start any transaction for each and every operation Unity is commit I return this transaction now I changed my mind that is I don't want to change name PSI to Ganesh now I want to undo this transaction in order to undo any transaction you can use rollback so just after writing this transaction just write your rollback and give semicolon and click enter whenever you write here roll back it will undo this operation that is this operation will not takes place guys just remember that we can undo any transaction only before writing commit after writing commit we cannot undo any transaction so use rollback only before commit don't use rollback after commit whatever the transaction that we perform this transaction will be stored permanently in database by using commit and if you want to undo any transaction then you need to use rollback this is all about transaction control language a class has been data control language shortly we call it as DCL data control language is used to control the axis and permissions to data stored in a database guys by using data control language we can give various permissions to various users for example there are three users for this user I want to give only read permission that is this person can only read data he cannot insert data and for this person I want to give write permission that means you can read data and as well as you can write data and for this person I want to give only read permission so if you give only read permission to particular users they can only read data but they cannot perform any modifications on data so you can give various permissions to various users by using data control language in software company there will be database administrator he will give various permissions to various users there are two commands in this data control language they are Grant and rework where Grant command is used to Grant permissions and revoke command is used to cancel permissions this is syntax of Grant command just ID a grant permission one permission to so on on table name to username and at last gives semicolon for example I am database administrator in my college there is one faculty with names I this faculties I want to insert data instrument table so as a database administrator I need to give insert and update permissions to this faculty PSI for that purpose we need to use Grant command so just write your Grant insert comma update on this I want to insert data instrument table so just right here on student to psi and it lasts you semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter now this faculty PSI can insert and update it on student table I given two permissions they are insert and update I given permissions now I want to remove these permissions so in order to remove permissions you need to use review command so write your revoke I want to remove insert and update permissions so just write your insert comma update on strand table from PSI whenever you write this code and click enter permissions are removed from Psy now this I cannot insert an update it on student table this is all about data control language guys in this dbms subject database language topic is very important in exam you may get separate questions like explain database language or you may also get questions like explain ddl DML dql TCL or DCL or you may also get separate question about each command so try to prepare this question perfectly next I will explain various types of keys that we use in dbms I will explain what is primary key foreign at first I will explain what is key database which stores data in the form of tables is known as relational database this key space very important role in relational database by using keys we can uniquely identify any record from the table I'll give an example for example let us consider the issue end table this is show entable data for example your name is Psy and your friend name is also Sai and you both belongs to section A whenever you see the student table based on rule number we can identify person your name is I each person can contain same name and same section but each and every person contain different rule numbers so based on rule number we can identify person for example don't consider this rule number column now here there is names I section A and here also there is names I and section A we can't identify records so these two records are same now if you consider rule number column here there is names I rule number two and section A and here there is names now this two records belongs to different person gas recursor nothing but rules one person is PSI rule number 12 and another person is 14. so by using keys we can uniquely identify any record here rule Mr column is considered as key because by using rule number we can uniquely identify person because by using rule number column we can uniquely identify any record so we call this rule number column as key is also used to establish and identify relationship between tables guys by using key we can establish relationship between tables by establishing primary key and foreign key relationship I can connect these two tables we can establish relationship between tables at first I will explain what is primary key guys by using primary key we can uniquely identify any record for example there is shown table in session table there are three columns one column is name column next column is rule number column and next to column is section column for example I given primary key for this rule number column whenever you give primary key for any particular column then that column must contain only unique values and it will not accept null values for example a given data like names I rule number one and section A name Shiva rule number two and section B name browser rule number transaction C next time my written name Harish rule number one and section d as this record is not accepted because one is repeated already for PSI there is rule number one again I written Harish and rule number one so this record is not accepted because I given primary key for this rule number column so this column must contain only unique values it will not accept duplicate values so here there is one and here also there is one so this one is duplicate value So This Record is not accepted already I given rule number one rule number two and rule number three so next time I cannot use this rule numbers so each and every value must be unique for example if I write Harish rule number four and section D it is accepted because here all our unique values there is no duplicate value for example there is another student Ramesh and section E I don't want to give rule number for Ramesh so I will write here null null is nothing but empty but whenever you give primary key for any particular column then null values are not accepted here rule number column is primary key so null values are not accepted so it will not insert This Record so whenever you give primary key for any particular column then that column must contain unique values and all values are not accepted this is all about primary key now I will write code in order to create student table I want to create table the table name is to end so right here create tables to end Open Bracket First Column is name so write your name which is column name and here you enter your data type I want to give name like names1 so all our characters so I need to use varka data type so right here and give your size for example for PSI one two three total there are three characters for Shiva one two three four five total five characters here I want to give limit that is 50. I return here where inside brackets I written 50 this is nothing but size H name will support up to 50 characters PSI 3 character Shiva Phi characters like that each name will support up to 50 characters so I written here name which is column name and data type that is worker 50 comma next to column is rule number so write here rule number which is column name I want to give rule numbers like rule number one rule number two rule number three so one so all our integer values so I'm giving data type that is int now I want to give primary key for this rule number column so just after writing rule number and data type just write your primary key so write your primary space key that is nothing but I am giving primary key for this rule number column comma and last column is section so right here section I want to give section like section a section B sections is so one all our characters so I'm giving data type that is VR care where wire care stands for variable character and give size I want to give only Single Character so you can give size 1. but I will give your size 10 that means each value will support up to 10 characters I open this bracket now I need to close this bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon guess whenever you write this code and click enter it will create three columns they are name rule number and section where this rule number column is primary key now I will insert data like names I rule number one and section A name Shiva rule number two and section B name Raju rule number three and section c now I will insert this data and show end table I write code for this now we'll write code in order to insert this data insert into I want to insert data instrument table so write a table name that is to end insert into strand values I want to give values like first one is name name column is varka data type so write sign quotations comma rule number is integer so there is no enough quotation just write here one comma next to column section so give your section that is a section is quotations take names bracket comma name Shiva rule number one section B comma comma next one is Raju rule number three and section c the class gives semicolon guys whenever you write this code and click enter it will insert this records instrument table for example I return here comma name Ramesh rule number one and section D comma I want to insert another record that is name Harish I don't want to give rule number so just I will write here null guys if you want to give null values then don't use quotations just write your null comma section e use semicolon at last guess whenever you write this code and click enter it will display error because here already first I I given rule number one so again for ramesha given rule number one so duplicate values are not accepted because a given primary key for rule number column and also for Harish I given null value even null values are not accepted so don't write these two records this is all about primary key next I will explain what is foreign key foreign key is the column of the table use it to point to primary key of another table guys I will give an example so that you can clearly understand what is foreign key for example it is considered there are two tables one table is departmentable and established student table for example for Department table I took two columns they are name column and did column here for DAV column I will take primary key primary key is nothing but it will accept unique values and null values are not accepted guess primary key is nothing but primary key will accept only unique values and it will not accept null values that is why I took unique values in did column now there is another table the table is showing table in this showing table I took three columns they are name column rule number column and department number column now what I will do is I will connect this department number column with Dad column now what I will do is I will select a did column from Department table and department number column from student table and I will connect these two columns by establishing primary key and foreign key relationship primary came in it will accept unique values and all values are not accepted whereas foreign came in here foreign case department number and this department number column is connected to primary key that is Dad column from Department table so whenever you give foreign key for any particular column then whatever the values that are present inside primary key this department number column will accept only these values here department number column will accept only these values here total there are four values they are one two three four so in this department number column I can enter only these values whereas for primary key null values are not accepted but whereas for foreign key null values are accepted for example I don't want to give department number for Ganesh so just a written here null primary key must contain only unique values but whereas in foreign key foreign key can contain duplicate values here first IIT department number one and here for sureshadow department number one so duplicate values are accepted only condition is that whenever you give rnk for any particular column with reference to primary key in this foreign column so it will display error it first I will create Department table the two columns name and Eid so it first write create table and table name that is Department open bracket I want to give two columns one column is name and data type that is where 50. comma next column that is GID in this GID column I want to enter numbers like one two three four solute data type that is int and I want to set primary key for this jid column so after writing data type just write here primary space key I open this bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon whenever you run this code it will create Department table with two columns there name and Eid now I want to insert values in this department table so right here insert into table name that is Department values insert bracket give values first one is CSC in quotations comma 1 comma next value that is AML in quotations comma 2 comma next DS in quotations comma 3 close bracket comma and next one is ECE in quotations comma 4 in Brackets and at last you SEMA colon guys take each recurrent bracket that's it whenever you run this code it will insert these values for example if I take Tripoli one it will not accept you because already for CAC I took one so again if you take one it will display error because Dad column is primary key it will not accept duplicate values it will accept only unique values for example for triply if I take null I don't want to give value so if I write here null so even though it is not accepted because primary key will not accept null values so just I return this code now I want to create another table the table is stream table and I want to insert three columns name rule number and department number normally each and every person contain different rule numbers so I'll give primary key for this rule number column and for this department number column I'll give foreign key and I will connect this department number column to did column which is present in Department table I let code for this to write here create table and table name that is student Open Bracket First Column is name so write here name and data type that is where care and I'm using up to 50. comma next column is rule number rule number and I will set primary key for this rule number column so after writing it right here primary space key that means this rule number column is now primary key and next another column that is department number column so right here department number which is column name and data type I want to give department number like one two three so one so right here in comma now I need to set this department number column as foreign key now I need to connect this department number column to did column which is present in Department table so right here foreign space foreign this column should refer to did column which is present in Department table so write your references column so table name Department insert brackets right column name that is did column I open this main bracket now I need to close this main bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon so just I created three columns one column is name column and data type next one is rule number column data type and this rule number column is primary key and next column is department number column and data type in now I am selecting this department number column as foreign key with references to primary key that is Dad column in Department table so I written here foreign space key insert bracket department number column references departmentable did column so Department which is table name insert bracket did column and close this bracket and give semicolon whenever you run this code it will create student table now I want to insert values so right here insert into table name that is student values first value is PSI 121 and 1. so writes I in quotations comma 121 comma 1 and again comma take another bracket these are values that I want to insert guys for example if I write here Suresh 124 and 5 this code will not be executed because we can take only one two three four values if you don't want to give department number then just you can write your null there is only of using quotation funnel now I want to check whether values are inserted or not so just right here select star Starman complete columns from table name that is showing and give semicolon whenever you run this code this is my output this is all about foreign key guys next time I'll explain what is super key candidate key alternate can composite key guys we will not add any code for these four Keys JCT series concept that's it set first channel what is super key it is a set of columns that can uniquely identify a record is known as a Super Key is nothing but it is a set of columns that can uniquely identify a record and it support null values I'll give an example so that you can clearly understand what is super key so a column is said to be a Super Key if it contain unique values and null values are accepted for example this is showing table data If You observe name column in name columns I repeated twice and Shiva repeated twice so it is not unique there are duplicate values so this name column is not a super key for rule number column each and every value is unique there are no duplicate values so rule number column is considered super key so I'll create one set by taking this rule number column similarly address here for address column Hyderabad repeated twice and daily repeated wise so there are no unique values there are duplicate values in this column so address is not your super key and next to consider mobile number here for mobile number column each and every value is unique and here for Super Key null values are accepted for example for student PSI there is no mobile number so I return here null so for this mobile number column all values are unique but there is one null value even though there is one null value it is considered Super Key only condition is that each and every column must contain unique values and null values are accepted so I'll create one separate set for mobile number column and last column is other number in this other number column all values are unique there are no duplicate values and here for Shiva there is no other number so I written here null even though there is one null value all values are unique so other number column is considered super key so I'll take this other number in my separate set so write other number in a set in this student table total there are three Super Key columns they are rule number column mobile number column and other number column so I took three columns in three sets and your name column is left and address column is left here name column is not a super key so now what I will do is I will combine this name column with any other Super Key column and then I will form a set here I can combine name column with rule number column or mobile number column or other number column so now I will combine this name column with rule number column and then I will farmace it when name column is not a Super Key but rule number column is a Super Key and next address column is left so you can combine this address column with any other Super Key columns guys not only single Super Key you can also combine this address column with multiple super keys so here I will take address comma mobile number comma rule number Guys these are various super keys in this particular table is nothing but it is a set of columns that can uniquely identify record these are various set of columns by using these columns we can uniquely identify record guys a column is said to be a Super Key if it contain unique values and null values are accepted if there are any non Super K columns then you need to combine this non-super key column with super key column when name column is non-super key and Rule Number column is super key and I combine this address column with mobile number column and Rule Number column here address column is non-super key and mobile number and Rule Number columns are super keys this is all about Super Key next time lesson what is candidate key guess minimal super key is known as candidate key that's minimal Super Key just remember this point this candidate key is a column or set of columns that can uniquely identify each record foreign key we can uniquely identify each column Guys these are various super keys in the student table in this minimal super key is known as candidate key here for this set there is only one column that is rule number and here for this set there is only one column there is mobile number and here for this set there is only one column that is other number and here there are two columns and here there are three columns so minimal super key is known as candid key so here there is only one column and here one column and here one column so rule number mobile number and other number this rear consider as candidate keys because they are minimal super Keys guys know from this candidate keys I will choose one primary key primary key is nothing but that column must contain unique values and null values are not accepted so if you consider this rule number column mobile number and other number column here rule number column can be primary key because all values are unique and there are no null values so I can consider this rule number as primary key and for mobile number column there is null value so it is not considered as primary key so for other number column there is an all value so this other number column is not your primary key so this rule number column is primary key next relation what is alternate key guys total there are three candidate keys on that I chosen this rule number column as primary key from candidate keys if you consider any candidate key as your primary key then remaining candidate keys are considered as alternate case so mobile number and other number both are considered as alternate keys Next Generation what is composite key primary key consists of more than one columns is known as composite key for example in this table rule number column is primary key now what I will do is I will select this rule number column and also I'll select some other columns like name column and mobile number column where this rule number column is primary key primary key consists of more than one columns is known as composite key so here primary key column contains name column and as well as mobile number column so we call this set as composite key next I will explain complete view shopping in dbms I will explain what is view what is simple view what is complex View and also I will explain how to create view update View and delete View it first of all explain what is View guys view is nothing but it is simply a virtual table for example let us consider there is college database inside College database there is showing table this is showing table data now what I want to do is I want to create this twin table again with the same data so again I need to write code in order to create student table and in order to insert this data so it is time taking process in order to overcome this problem we can use view just by using select command you need to select all these data and you need to place the data in view that's view is nothing but it is simply a virtual table for example what I want to do is I want to create the same showing table again with the same data so just by writing single line of code you can create this table so right here create view guys view is nothing but it is simply a virtual Table after writing create view here you need to give view name for example I want to give your name as my view so right here a create view of my view which is view name as Now by using select command you need to select data whatever the data that is present in session table I want to place this complete data in my view by using select command you need to select data so right here select star I want to select all these three columns so I return a star so storm in all these three columns from table name I want to select data from student table so right here student and it was your semicolon whenever you write this line of code and click enter it will create View that your name is my view here in this my view I selected complete data which is my next student table so this my view contains complete data which is by an instrument table guys this my view is also a table previously there is only one table that is true and table but this time there are two tables they are showing table and as well as my view table whenever you're at show tables it will display complete tables which is present in a database there are two tables in database so whenever I write this code and click enter it will display two tables they are showing table and next one is my view table I want to see data which is spent in my view table so you need to write code that is Select star from guys in order to see data which is present table you need to write select star from table name and in order to see data which is run in view you need to write select star from view name I want to see data which is planned in my view table so just write your selected star from my view this my view contains complete data which is present student table so whenever I write your selected start from IBO it will display this complete table this is my output okay selected star from Schwinn main it will select complete data from all these three columns but this time I don't want to select complete data I want to select only data of the students whose section is a your size section is a and Raju section is a and nagendra section is a so I want to select only these three records and I want to create one separate view so I will create one separate view by selecting these three records so write code that is create View and here you need to give your name previously I given view name as my view this time I will give my view name as my view 1. so create view my view 1 as select guys I want to select all these three columns like name PSI rule number one and section A so right here star select star from table name my table name is Trend so right here student and now you need to give condition you can give condition by using where where section equal to a in quotations whenever you write this line of code and click enter it will create view that view name is my view one this my view one contains only data of the students whose section is a your size section is a whenever you write your show tables it will display three tables as output they are student my view and my view one I want to see data which is present in my view one so you need to write code that is Select star from view name that is my view one and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter this is my output Starman complete columns so it will display complete Columns of the student whose section is complete three columns but this time I don't want compare three columns I just want only name column and Rule Number column as output I need to skip this section column so I will create view by selecting only two columns their name column and Rule Number column so I'll add code for this so right here create View and view name I want to give your name as my view to my view too as select Starman complete columns but I don't want to select complete columns I want to select only name column and Rule Number column so right here so right here select name comma rule number from table name table name is joint so write your student whenever you write this code and click enter it will create view that view name is my view too so whenever you write show tables it will display completely four tables there showing table my view table my view one table and my view 2 table this is my output now I want to see data which is present in my view too in order to see data you need to write select star from my view to this is my output it will skip the section column and it will display only name column and Rule Number column so this is my output views are nothing but they are simply a virtual tables a view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database guys same like tables views also contain rows and columns based on given condition view can contain all rows or it can also contain only specific rows it all depends on condition till now we created views next I will explain how to update views for example if you consider my view one this myv1 contains complete data of the students whose section is a now I want to update this my view one previously my V1 content complete date of this event whose section is a this time I want to update my view 1 by selecting complete data of the students whose section is B so right here by using replace command we can update view so right here replace View view name is my view one as select star from student where section equal to B take bin quotations whenever you are at this line of code and click enter now this myv1 contains only section B data If You observe this table in this table only Shiva section is B so it will store Shiva rule number two and section B whenever you write select star from IV one it will display output that is name Shiva rule number one section B this is my output by using replace command we can update views guys for example if you consist student table in the student table I change your name PSI to name ABC whatever the changes that you made to this main table automatically these changes are reflected to all these views because we created these three views by using the student table so if you change any data instrument table automatically these changes are updated in all these views so now my view my view 1 and my view 2. so in all these three views it will update names sorry to name ABC thus deleting view is same like deleting table in order to delete table you need to write drop table table name in order to delete view you need to write raw viewername I created three views now I want to delete this reviews so right here drop view my view drop view my V1 drop view my view 3. this is how we delete views guys if you create view by selecting only single table then we call it as simple view in this example I created view by selecting only single table that is driven table so if you create view by selecting single table then we call it as simple View if you create view by selecting multiple tables then we call it as complex view I will give example for example it is considered there are two tables one table is showing table and next table is Branch table now I want to select the name column from this to end table and I want to select a b name column from this Branch table by selecting these two columns I want to create one separate View a red code for this so it first write create view I want to give your name as Mu so create view in view as select guys in order to create view from multiple tables definitely there must be one common column If You observe student table instrument table for Sid column there is one two three similarly in Branch table for bid column there is one two three so in order to create view from multiple table there must be some matching data I want to select name column from student table so right here selector shouldn't which is table name dot column name I want to select name column next I want to select B name column from Branch table so comma branch which is table name dot column name I want to select B name column so right here Branch dot b name I selected two columns one is name column from student table comma B name column from Branch table I selected two columns from two tables so from student comma branch and here you need to give condition where student dot Sid is equal to branch.bad student dot Sid is equal to Branch dot bid and give semicolon here there is match one one so it will selects iaml and here there is two two there is match so it will select Shiva CSC and there is Match 3 3 it will select gun HDs I created view that view name is Mu this is M view data for example instrument table there is an agendra Phi and Raju one a given condition that is showing dot Sid is equal to branch.bid If You observe this nagendra for nagendra there is Phi in this column Phi is not present so it will not select this record and next Raju one here for Raju there is one and here for AML there is one so it will select Raju AML so it will select Raju AML here I created view by selecting multiple tables they are showing table and Branch table so we call it as complex view complex view is nothing but creating views from multiple tables this is all about views next I will explain aggregate functions Topic in dbms and also I will explain what is distinct keyword and also explain what is Group by class aggregated function is used to perform the calculations on multiple rows of a single column of the table and it returns a single value as output guys I will give an example so that you can clearly understand this definition total there are five aggregate functions they are count sum average Max and min it first selection what is Count function count function is used to count number of rows in a database table just in order to count number of rows we need to use count function I'll give an example for example this is showing table data now I want to count number of rows present in this table so I've written here select count gas will represent function in Brackets so inside brackets are written star star is nothing but Starman complete columns it will select data which is present in all these columns so I written is Star from table name from string table I want to select data so I written here from student and it lasts use semicolon that's whenever you write this code and click enter it will count number of rows Prime in all columns so total there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 total there are six rows so whenever I write this code and click enter it will display output that is 6. now I don't want to select complete columns I want to select Only Rule Number column and I want to count number of rows for the name rule number column so I written here select count inside bracket I written Only Rule Number column because I want to count number of rows present in only rule number column so I written here rule number from table name table name is student so written here from student and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter it will count number of rows by any rule number column so into number column one two three four five six total there are six rows so I'll get output that is 6. for example in place of writing one if I write here null null is nothing but empty so it will not consider null and total there are one two three four five so total there are only five rows so it will display output that is 5 5 is my output next one is sum function sum function is used to calculate sum of all columns and we can apply some function only to numbers only there are two numeric columns in this table they are rule number column and marks column so I can apply some function only to these columns for example I will apply some function to Marks column so just in place of writing count I return here sum and I applied some function to Marks column so I written here select the sum of marks from table name that is showing whenever I write this code and click enter it will perform addition on all these rows in this marks column so 75 plus CID Plus 90 plus 60 plus 50 plus 100 that is 455 so whenever I write this code and click enter it will display output that is 455. guys aggregate functions will display only single values output in this table we update aggregate functions to all this rows in this marks column so a grade function is used to perform calculations on multiple rows of a single column of the table and it will display only single variable as output so this is my output that is 455. next Generation what is use of Max function where Max function is used to identify maximum number in particular column and whereas nin function is used to identify minimum number in particular column for example I want to identify maximum value and minimum value in this particular column for that purpose we need to use max function and Min function so written here select Max of marks column from student table whenever I add this code and click enter it will find maximum number in marks column here maximum value is hundred so I'll get output that is hundred whenever I write this code and click enter it will display output that is hundred just in place of writing Max function I written here Min function in order to identify minimum value in this table minimum value is 50 so it will display output that is 50. so whenever I write here Select A Min of marks from student it will display output that is 50. and last function is average function that is AVG so I written here select AVG of marks column from student table how to calculate average 75 plus I T Plus 90 plus 60 plus 50 plus 100. by total there are six rows one two three four five six so by 6 so 75 is my output these are various aggregate functions guys next Direction what is use of distinct keyword just in order to avoid duplicate values from particular column or table you need to use distinct keyword I'll give an example for example I want to see data which is present section column so I need to write select column name that is I want to see data which is Prime in section column so I'm writing column name that is section foreign twice I don't want duplicate values I want to remove duplicate values so for that purpose we need to use distinct keyword so just you need to write here select a distinct column name that is section from table name from student I written here distinctive so it will avoid duplicate values so I'll get output that is section ABC this is my output it will avoid duplicate values from the section column distinct that is name column from student table it will display output that is Sai Shiva Ramesh Suresh and Harish yes I repeat it twice but it will display PSI only once extraction what is use of group by class Group by class groups rows with same values from the selected column for example in this one table I am selecting section column in the section column A repeated twice B repeated twice and C repeated twice whenever I apply Group by to this particular column it will group same values and then it will display that values only once for example if I apply Group by to the section column it will display output that is ABC it will display only once code that is Select I want to select section columns or right section from table name that is to end and just you need to write here Group by group Space by section normally if you write your selected section from student it will display output that is section ABC ABC but just write on your group Space by section that means it will group same data a repeated twice so it will form a as one group as similarly two B's so B is one group and there are two C's so C is one group Total there are three groups they are ABC so this is my output here in this section column A is repeated twice and B is repeated wise and C is repeated twice now what I want to do is I want to see sections and as well as number of times the sections are repeated I should get output like this so I need to write here select I want to select section column so right here section and I want to call number of time sections are repeated so right here count I'm using your count function so write your count of section from table name that is student table group Space by section whenever I write this code and click enter the display output that is section column and as well as count of section column by grouping the section column so whenever I write this code and click enter this is my output next I will explain Integrity constraints Topic in dbms guys we also call Integrity constraints as constraints both are same guys constraints are nothing but they are set of rules whatever the rules that we apply on database columns we call those rules as constraints but why we need to apply these rules we need to apply these rules because in order to maintain correctness of data that is nothing but in order to maintain quality of information if you apply Integrity constraints while creating table then whatever the information that we are going to show in the table that information will be correct there will not be any errors that is why we need to use Integrity constraints guys total there are four types of Integrity constraints they are domain constraints entity Integrity constraints referential Integrity constraints and key constraints I will explain all these constraints by giving examples it first of all explain what are domain constraints each table has certain set of columns and each column allows a same type of data based on its data type the column does not accept the values of any other data type guys for example for example it is consideration table these are three columns one column is name next column is rule number and next column is section for example I want to enter name like names I name Ramesh one so if you work a data type for this name column for example I want to enter roll numbers like rule number one rule number two so on so I'll give integer type to this rule number column if you give integer type to a particular column then you can enter only integer values in this column you cannot enter characters similarly if you give arcade data type to any particular column then you need to enter only characters you cannot enter integer values so each column allows a same type of data based on its data type the column does not accept the values of any other data type domain constraints are combination of data type and constraints these are various domain constraints they are not null constant unique constraint primary key constant foreign table and I will apply all these constraints to various columns example I created showing table these are various columns in student table first constraint is not null for example I applied normal constant to this name column whenever I apply an ordinal constant to this name column then this name column will not accept null values for example I written name PSI name Shiva for example for third person I don't want to write name so I written here null null is nothing but empty but it will not accept null values because I give an ordinal constant to this name column next constant is unique constraint for example I applied unique constant to this rule number column whenever I apply unique constant to this rule number column then this rule number column will accept only unique values for example for PSI I to rule number one for Shiva to rule number two next time for Ramesh again I do rule number one but it will not accept because I applied unique constant so each and every value must be unique that is nothing but each and every value must be different it will not accept duplicate values so I need to take here three guys at last I will explain primary key and foreign this is check condition for example for PSI I given a17 it is accepted for Shiva given h10 it is accepted but for Amisha given H20 but it is not accepted because because for this age column a given check condition that is H must be less than 18. so if you give age 18 or greater than 18 it is not accepted so you need to give only h less than 18 so it is not accepted because for example it is considered there are hundred students all the students belongs to section A so for each and every student writing section is difficult so directly you can apply default constant for example for this section column a given condition that is default section is a and you need to take a in quotation because it is work a data type so there is no need of giving values operately automatically it will take section A instead of writing section A for each and every student directly you can use default constraint so that there is noid of writing section here for each and every student automatically by default it will take section A now I will write code in order to create show end table and in order to apply various constraints to various columns at first I want to create student table so internet code that is create table and here you need to give table name that is student I want to create table that is streamed so I written here strand Open Bracket First Column is name so I written here name I want to enter name like name Sai Ram S1 all our data types so I'm giving data type that is VR care each name can support up to 50 characters so I am giving says that is 50. name worker 50 now I will apply normal constraint to this name column so after writing data type just right here not space null guys data type is constant both are considered as domain constraints comma next column is rule number so I written here rule number I want to use rule number like rule number one two so one all are integer data types solute data type that is in and I will apply unique constant to this rule number column unique all are small letters comma next column is each so right here is I want to give is like age 12 13 so on all our integer data types so I'll do data type that is int and I am giving condition that is H must be less than 18 so after writing data type right here check Open Bracket now insert brackets you need to give condition that is age must be less than 18. close this bracket comma next column is section so right here section which is column name I want to give section like section ABC so on all our data types so right here we are care actually section A is only one character but I will give limit that is 10 characters that means each value can support up to 10 characters and I am giving condition that is default e in quotations write section A I open this main bracket now I will close this main bracket and it was use semicolon whenever I write this code and click enter it will create student table with four columns and it will apply various constraints to various columns now I want to insert values so right here insert into table name that is shown I want to insert only name rule number and age I don't want to insert section because because automatically it will take section A so just select only name column rule number column and age column so insert bracket select name column comma rule number column comma each column values I want to give values like name PSI for name column I given where data type so takes I in quotations comma rule number for example I will give rule number one and I will give is that is 17 guys just remember that H must be less than 18 so I took here 17 close this bracket next I want to insert another record like name Shiva rule number two and a16. and give semicolon Yes whenever you write this code and click enter you will insert names I rule number one is 17 automatically it will take section A and again Shiva rule number 2 a16 and section A guess for example if you don't give any value then it will take default value but if you give value then it will take that value for example I want to insert data like name Raju rule number three htn section B so write your insert into student values Raju in quotations comma 3 comma 10 comma section bin quotations I took here section B so it will insert section B if you don't take value it will select default value but if you take any value it will insert that value this is all about domain constants guys I will explain this primary key and foreign example separately next I will explain what are key constraints total there are three primary types of key constraints they are unique key primary key and foreign key guys I already explained what is unique key guys if you give unique for any particular column then that column will accept only unique values if you give duplicate values they are not accepted guys at last I will explain primary and foreign example next I will explain what are entity Integrity constraints this entity Integrity constraint states that primary key value can't be null whenever you give primary key for any particular column that column will accept only unique values and all values are not accepted so just remember that entity Integrity constant states that primary key value is here you need to give primary key example a class selection primary key example and last one is referential integrity constraints a referential Integrity constant is specified between two tables guys for example it is considered there are two tables for one table I given primary key and for one table again foreign key this foreign key is connected to this primary key that is nothing but this foreign key is referring to this primary key that is why we call it as referential Integrity constraint differential is nothing but foreign key is referring to primary key here also you need to give primary key and foreign example guys here for domain constraints referential Integrity constraints and key constraints you need to give primary key and foreign key example and whereas for entity Integrity constant you need to give primary example so at first I will explain what is primary key guys by using primary key we can uniquely identify any record for example there is shown table in session table there are three columns one column is name column next column is rule number column and next to column is section column for example I given primary key for this rule number column whenever you give primary key for any particular column then that column has to contain only unique values and it will not accept null values for example a given data like names I rule number one and section A name Shiva rule number one section B name Raju rule number three and section c next time my written name Harish rule number one and section d as this record is not accepted because one is repeated already for PSI there is rule number one again I return Horizon rule number one so this record is not accepted because I given primary key for this rule number column so this column must contain only unique values it will not accept duplicate values so here there is one and here also there is one so this one is duplicate value So This Record is not accepted already given rule number one rule number two and rule number three so next time I cannot use this rule numbers so each and every value must be unique for example if I write Harish rule number four and section D it is accepted because here all our unique values there is no duplicate value for example there is another student Ramesh and section E I don't want to give roll number for Ramesh so I will write here null null is nothing but empty but whenever you give primary key for any particular column then null values are not accepted here rule number column is primary key so null values are not accepted so it will not insert This Record so whenever you give primary key for any particular column then that column must contain unique values and all values are not accepted this is all about primary key now I will write code in order to create student table I want to create table the table name is to end so right here create tables to end Open Bracket First Column is name so write your name which is column name and here you enter your data type I want to give name like names1 so all our characters so I need to use varka data type so right here and give your size for example for PSI one two three total there are three characters for Shiva one two three four five total five characters here I want to give limit that is 50. I return here where inside brackets I written 50 this is nothing but size H name will support up to 50 characters PSI 3 character Shiva Phi characters like that each name will support up to 50 characters so I written here name which is column name and data type that is worker 50 comma next to column is rule number so write your rule number which is column name I want to give rule numbers like rule number one rule number two rule number three so one so all our integer values so I'm giving data type that is int now I want to give primary key for this rule number column so just after writing rule number and data type just write here primary key so write your primary space key that is nothing but I am giving primary key for this rule number column comma and last column is section so right here section I want to give section like section here section B sections is so one all our characters so I'm giving data type that is VR care where wire care stands for variable character and give size I want to give only Single Character so you can give size 1. but I will give your size 10 that means each value will support up to 10 characters I open this bracket now I need to close this bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon guess whenever you write this code and click enter it will create three columns they are name rule number and section where this rule number column is primarily now I will insert data like name PSI Rule Number 1 and section A name Shiva rule number 2 and section B name Raju rule number three and section c now I will insert this data instrument table I'll write code for this now we'll write code in order to insert this data insert into I want to insert data and student table so write a table name that is showing insert into strand values I want to give values like first one is name name column is varka data type so write sign quotations comma rule number is integer so there is no enough quotation just write here one comma next to column section so give your section that is a section is where data type so use quotations take names bracket comma name Shiva rule number one section B comma comma next one is Raju rule number three and section c the class gives semicolon guys whenever you write this code and click enter it will insert this records instrument table for example I return here comma name Ramesh rule number one and section D comma I want to insert another record that is name Harish I don't want to give rule number so just I will write here null guys if you want to give null values then don't use quotations just write your null comma section e use semicolon at last guys whenever you write this code and click enter it will display error because here already for PSI I given rule number one so again for ramesha given rule number one so duplicate values are not accepted because a given primary key for rule number column and also for Harish I given null value even null values are not accepted so don't write these two records so that you can clearly understand what is foreign key for example it is considered there are two tables one table is departmentable and established to end table for example for Department table I took two columns they are name column and did column here for DAV column I will take primary key primary key is nothing but it will accept unique values and null values are not accepted gas primary key is nothing but primary key will accept only unique values and it will not accept null values that is why I took unique values in the ID column now there is another table the table is showing table in this showing table I took three columns they are name column rule number column and department number column now what I will do is I will connect this department number column with Dad column now what I will do is I will select a did column from Department table and department number column from student table and I will connect these two columns by establishing primary key and foreign key relationship primary came in it will accept unique values and null values are not accepted whereas foreign came in here foreign case department number and this department number column is connected to primary key that is did column from Department table so whenever you give foreign key for any particular column then whatever the values that are present inside primary key this department number column will accept only these values here department number column will accept only these values here total there are four values here one two three four so in this department number column I can enter only these values whereas for primary key null values are not accepted but whereas for foreign key null values are accepted for example I don't want to give department number for Ganesh so J star return here null primary key must contain only unique values but whereas in foreign key foreign key can contain duplicate values here first I I took department number one and here for sureshadow department number one so duplicate values are accepted only condition is that whenever you give rnk for any particular column with reference to primary key in this foreign column so it will display error it first I will create Department table the two columns name and Eid so it first write create table and table name that is Department open bracket I want to give two columns one column is name and data type that is where 50. comma next column that is GID in this GID column I want to enter numbers like one two three four so I'll give data type that is Inked and I want to set primary key for this GID column so after writing data type just write here primary space key I open this bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon whenever you run this code it will create Department table with two columns there name and Eid now I want to insert values in this department table so right here insert into table name that is Department values insert bracket give values first one is CSC in quotations comma 1 comma next value that is AML in quotations comma 2 comma next DS in quotations comma 3 close bracket comma and next one is ECE in quotations comma 4 in Brackets and at last use semicolon guys take each recurrent bracket that's it whenever you run this code it will insert these values for example if I take Tripoli one it will not accept you because already for CAC I took one so again if you take one it will display error because Dad column is primary key it will not accept duplicate values it will accept only unique values for example for triple if I take null I don't want to give value so if I write here null so even though it is not accepted because primary key will not accept null values so just I return this code now I want to create another table the table is to end table and I want to insert three columns name rule number and department number normally each and every person content different rule numbers so I'll give primary key for this rule number column and for this department number column I'll give foreign key and I will connect this department number column to did column which is present in Department table I let code for this so right here create table and table name that is student Open Bracket First Column is name so write here name and data type that is where care and I'm using up to 50. comma next column is rule number rule number and I will set primary key for this rule number column so after writing it right here primary space key that means this rule number column is now primary key and next another column that is department number column so right here department number which is column name and data type I want to give department number like one two three so one so right here in comma now I need to set this department number column as foreign key now I need to connect this department number column to did column which is present in Department table so right here foreign space foreign this column should refer to did column which is present in Department table so write your references column so table name Department insert brackets right column name that is did column I open this main bracket now I need to close this main bracket so close this bracket and give semicolon so just I created three columns one column is name column and data type next one is rule number column data type and this rule number column is primary key and next column is department number column and data type in now I am selecting this department number column as foreign key with references to primary key that is did column in Department table so I written here foreign space key insert bracket department number column references Department table did column so Department which is table name insert bracket did column and close this bracket and gives semicolon whenever you run this code it will create student table now I want to insert values so right here insert into table name that is showing values first value is PSI 121 and 1. so writes I in quotations comma 121 comma 1 and again comma take another bracket these are values that I want to insert guys for example if I write here Suresh 124 and 5 this code will not be executed because we can take only one two three four values if you don't want to give department number then just you can write your null there is only of using quotation funnel now I want to check whether values are inserted or not so just right here select star Starman complete columns from table name that is showing and give semicolon whenever you run this code this is my output this is all about foreign key next I will explain logical databases and Topic in dbms in this logical database design topic I will explain how to convert entity sets to tables week entity sets to tables and also I'll explain how to convert relationship search to tables the process of converting ER diagrams into tables is known as logical database design guys in each and every software company there will be Data Page designer the main duty of database designer is to draw ER diagrams after drawing ER diagrams this database designer will submit the CR diagrams to database developers by seeing the CR diagram this database developers will create tables at first I will explain how to convert entity cells to tables for example this is simple ER diagram in ear diagram and today is nothing but table name and we will represent entity in rectangle so inside rectangular return student so we consider this unit as table name so this unit is an entity and whereas name rule number and section we call them as attributes and we will represent attributes in ellipse these attributes are nothing but column names If You observe this rule number attribute for this rule number attribute I do candle line symbol so whenever you take underline symbol for any particular attribute then we consider this attribute as primary key attribute so this rule number attribute is primary key attribute guys for example if this identity contains only one record like name PSI rule number 21 and section A if the sanity contains only one record then we call it as entity but if this entity contains more than one record then we call it as entity set for example there are two records like name PSI rule number 21 section A name Shiva rule number 22 and section B now we call this student as entity set now the student is not entity this unit is entity set because it contains more than one record so this trend is an entity set now we need to convert this entity set into table whenever Data Page designer Design This diagram now this diagram is given to database developer then by saying this diagram database all upper will create table with three columns and he will give primary key for this rule number column this is code at first you need to create student table so right here create table and table name that is showing Open Bracket and we need to insert three columns they are name rule number and section so it was a written name for example I want to give a name like PSI Shiva so one other character data types so I took here data type that is where care for example if you can just PSI total there are one two three three characters like that are given size 50. so each name can support up to 50 characters next one is rule number column so I written here rule number I want to give rule number like one two three so one so I took data type that is int and we need to give primary key for this rule number column so after writing data type just I written here primary space key comma next column is Section I want to intersection like section a section B so one so I'm taking data type that is VR care and I am giving limit that is size 10. I open this un bracket now I need to close this to end bracket semicolon whenever you run this code it will create this table for example this is another ER diagram in this ER diagram from this name attribute I am deriving another two attributes like first name attribute and last name attribute now from this name attribute I am deriving another two attributes so we call this name attribute as composite attribute and whereas first name attribute and last name attribute are simple attributes now we need to convert the CR diagram into table if you want to convert the CR diagram into table don't consider this composite attribute directly in the student table we need to create four columns they are first name last name rule number and section don't consider this composite attribute guys in exam you may get separate question like how to convert entity set with composite attributes into tables next I will explain how to convert week entities H2 tables gas we will represent strong entity set in single rectangle and whereas we will represent vacant it is set in double rectangle guys for example in college each department is located in one building like CS in one building AML in one building data science in one building and so on so only if there are buildings there will be Department for example a discharge building then automatically this department also will be destroyed reserving College Department as weak entity and I am connecting these two entities sets by establishing is located in relationship guys if you establish relationship between strong entry set and week entity set then that relation also will be weak that is why I represented this relationship in double rhombus where this is weak relationship entity set which do not contains any primary key attribute is known as weak entity set case here for Department ID attribute I took daughter lines so it is not primary key it is foreign key and whereas for this buildings entity set for B number attribute to candle and symbol so we call this B number as primary key entity set which contains primary key attribute is known as strong entity so this building is a strong entity now we need to convert the CR diagram into table so at first you need to create primary key Table after that you need to create foreign key table so at first I created primary key table and next you will need to create foreign key table that is department and attributes attribution column names Department ID column and Department name column guys here foreign key depends on primary key some connecting Department ID column 2 B number column it first we need to create primary key table this is code in order to create this table so right here create table and table name that is buildings Open Bracket First Column is B number column so right here B number I want to enter numbers like one two three four so one so I'm giving data type that is int and we need to give primary key for this B number column so after writing data type just write your primary space key that means we are giving primary key for this B number column comma next column is address so write your address and I want to enter address like Hyderabad daily so one so I'm giving data type that is Barca 50. each address can show up to 50 characters I open this main bracket now we need to close this main bracket and give semicolon whenever you run this code it will create this table next we need to create foreign key table so write your create table and table name that is Department open bracket First Column is Department ID I want to enter ID like one two three four so one so write your department ID space data type that is int comma next column is Department name so write your Dept name space data type I want to enter Department names like csca mlds01 so I'm giving data type that is where inside brackets are written 50 that is nothing but size comma for Department ID column so I written here Department ID that is Department ID column depends on B number column so right here references space table name that is buildings inside bracket right column name that is B number I open this main bracket now we need to close this main bracket and at last gives semicolon whenever you run this code it will create this table till now I explain how to convert strong entity set into table and weak entity set into table next I will explain how to convert relationship set into table guys for example let us consider there are two entity sets they are employee entity set and Department entity set as we know employee version department so I will connect this to entities by establishing work in relationship now we need to create table for this relationship set already there is one attribute in this relationship set that is since the since is nothing but column name normal like this relationship set contains primary keys of these both tables here for employee table primary key is employee ID and in this departmentable primary case did so this works in table contains both primary keys so in this works in table you need to create two columns their employee ID and as well as did and next to column is since so these are three columns in Works in table guys just remember that I took this employee ID from employee table employee ID column so this employee ID act as foreign key this foreign key is connected to employee table employee ID column which is primary key and similarly I took this did column from departmentable did column so this department ID column act as foreign key and this foreign key is connected to Department table did column which is primary key now I will write code in order to create this relationship set table so write your code create table and table name that is Works in Open Bracket First Column is employee ID so right here employee ID I want to give employee ID like one two three so one so I will give data type that is in comma next column is did again I want to enter numbers so I'll give data type that isn't and next one is since employee is working since 2000 2001 so on so again I want to enter here numbers so again I will do data type that isn't comma Now when you take your foreign key for this employee ID column and this foreign key is connected to primary key which is located in employee table Eid column solid code for this foreign space key foreign case employee ID so inside brackets write EMP ID references this foreign key is referring to employee table empid column so references employee table empid in Brackets which is column name comma next we need to give foreign key column name that is did references this foreign key column that is d8 is connected to departmentable did column so write your references I open this main bracket now close this main bracket and give semicolon whenever I run this entire code it will create this works in table now in this table employee ID and did column are foreign keys this is how we convert relationship set into table next I will explain complete relational algebra Topic in dbms I will explain all these relation operators with an examples explain what is relational algebra relational algebra is a fundamental Concept in database management system that helps us to manipulate and retrieve data from relational databases it consists of set of operations that can be applied to relations guys I will give an example so that you can clear an understand what is use of relational algebra 24. now I want to get complete record of student whose rule number is 21 so for that purpose we need to write SQL query like select star from student where rule number equal to 21. whenever I write this query I will get output names I rule number 21 because it will display record of student whose rule number is 21 yes I rule number is 21 so I'll get this entire record as output but before writing actual SQL query at first we need to write mathematical operation in paper here I return Sigma of rule number equal to 21 and table name is trend so whenever I write this mathematical operation I will get output names I rule number 21 before writing actual SQL query it first we need to write mathematical operation in paper so that writing SQL query becomes easy here I am using Sigma operator and I given condition rule number equal to 21 and a given table name strand so that same output will be displayed before performing actual operation in database if you write this mathematical query then it will be very easy to perform actual operation that is why Edgar if card introduces this relational algebra guys relation algebra is completely Theory concept we will not read this mathematical operation in MySQL software just we will write this mathematical operation paper that's it so just remember that relational algebra is completely Theory concept relational algebra is a fundamental Concept in database management system that helps us to manipulate and retrieve data from relational databases guys relational databases are nothing but databases which are stored in the form of tables is known as relational databases by using this relational algebra we can manipulate and retrieve data from tables it consists of set of operations that can be applied to relations we can perform various operations on tables Edgar ifcod is a person who developed a relational model he is a person who developed relational algebra 2 we call this relational algebra as formal or procedural query language we need to follow step by step process in order to get result relational algebra mainly provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases I already said before this relational algebra is nothing but a gesture Theory concept that will be applied on relational databases it is purely mathematics there is no English keywords in relational algebra it provides set of mathematical operations by using that mathematical operations we can manipulate and retrieve data from tables Guys these are various types of relational operations in relational algebra at first selection what is unary relational operations the name itself says United relational operations that mean unit remain only one operations which are performed on single table is known as unilation operations and the first one is Select operation in selection operation we need to use Sigma operator so for selection we need to use Sigma operator I will explain what is selection operation the selection operation is used to filter rows from a table based on certain condition it is similar to applying where clause in SQL queries this is syntax Sigma here you need to give condition and here you need to write relation relation is nothing but table name I'll give an example for example there is showing table shrink table contains names and similarly rule number 21 22 23 21 age 18 19 17 18. total there are four records one two three four for example I want to get enter record of strength whose rule number is 22. so further purpose we will write SQL query like select to start from student where rule number equal to 22. star is nothing but it will display entire record of trend whose rule number is 22 so selection operation is same like using where class in SQL for example I want to get enter record of trend whose rule number is 22 I should get output like Shiva 20 to 19. it should display entire record so just write your Sigma and here right rule number equal to 22 this is condition so it first write Sigma and Below Sigma unitary condition that is rule number equal to 22. my table name is Trend so I am writing strand in bracket whenever I run this mathematical operation this is my output I'll get output name Shiva rule number 2020 age 19. guys just remember method selection operation will display enter record for example I want to get only name but selection operation will not display only particular name it will display entire record I'll give one more example as I already said before for selection operations we need to use Sigma so gesture written here is Sigma under Sigma written name equal to psi and this is and name equal to cyan is equal to 18 this is my condition and table name is Trend we never run this mathematical operation it first will check whether name PSI and eject in is present in table yes names I and ajt in is presented first and similarly again it will check name sign is it not satisfied names are is not satisfied and again here name cyan age 18 total there are two records with names I and age 18. foreign twice that mean the selection operation will allow duplicate values for example names are a rule number 21 and section 18 repeated 10 times in this table so even though names I rule number 21 and age 18 repeated 10 times it will display output 10 times that means the selection operation will support duplicate values this is all about selection operation next one is projection operation whereas for selection operations we need to use Sigma symbol and whereas for projection operation we need to use Pi symbol this is pi symbol I'll explain definition of projection operation the projection operation is used to select specific columns from a table while discarding the other columns I already said before selection operation can't display single column it will display complete columns if you want only single column as output then you need to use projection operation this is index just Unity right here Pi I already said before for projection we need to spice symbol so at first you need to write Pi here you need to give column names how many columns that you want that many column names you need to write here below this pie after that you need to write your table name guys relation and table both are same for example there is student table student table contains three columns name rule number and age but I don't want this true number column I want to display only name column and age column so I'll let mathematical operation for this for projection unit is pi symbol so just write your Pi below Pi you need to write which columns you want I want only name column and H column so just I will write your name comma H columns and my table name is to end so I am writing a strand whenever I run this mathematical operation it will display only name column and H column as output so I'll get output name PSI is 18 Shiva 19 and nagendra 17. guess actually here names I rule number 21 and age 18 repeated twice here and here even though if any particular record repeated twice it will display only once so it will display names I rulema 21 and age 18 only once so projection operation will not allow duplicate values if any particular record is repeated multiple times it will display that record only once this is projection operation for example the discussion like select the name of the student whose age is 19. it should display only name of the student whose age is 19. so gesture Sigma and I am giving condition is equal to 19 and table name is Trend the selection operation will display enter record so I will get output here Shiva is 19 so I'll get output name Shiva and Rule Number 22 and age 19 but your question is I don't want complete record I just want name of the student whose age is 19. so just right here pi and I want only name column so just write your name that's it so we never write your file name it will display only name Shiva so my output is name Shiva this is my output this is use of projection operation next selection what is use of rename operation the name itself says rename if you want to rename columns or if you want to rename tables then you need to use rename operation this is syntax whereas for selection we need to use Sigma symbol and whereas for projection we need to use Pi symbol and whereas for rename unit use row symbol this is known as row symbol this syntax just write a row below row you need to write new table name and here you need to give all table name for example there is student table I want to change name from student to students so just below this row right students this is example for example there is student table instrument table there is my name column now I want to change this my name column to name column I want to change column name from my name to name so just you need to write here new column name and you need to give your old column name old column name is my name by using rename operation you can rename table names and as well as column names these are three unary relational operators next I will explain what is Cartesian product the name itself says Cartesian product product main into in dbm is Cartesian product is an operation user in relational algebra to combine all possible pairs of rows from two tables we also call Cartesian product as cross product and we need to denote this Cartesian product with X symbol this is syntax relation 1 into relation to guys relation is nothing but table table and relation both are same so table 1 into table 2. for example there are two tables one is showing table and next one is Project table gauge student table condensed two records its name so I rule number one and nagendra rule number two totally there are two records and similarly project table contains four records s name Raju project ID 121 similarly Ram h122 Suresh 123 and PSI 124 here total there are two records and here total there are four records so two into four that is yet records total this Cartesian product will produce 8 records as output so it was what we need to do is at first we need to combine faster car with all these records and next we need to comment secondary card with all these records I will draw tables so that you can clearly understand at first we need to select first record and we need to combine this first record with all these records so just right here is name rule number we are combining two tables so just write here s name rule number and here its name and project ID here first card is PSI and one we need to combine this with Raju and 121 similarly again select first record that is PSI 1 and combine this with second record Ramesh and 122. and similarly again select this first records i1 and combine this with r record Suresh 123 and again select this i1 and combine this with fourth record that is PSI and 124. now again select secondary card from first table that is nagendra and 2 and combine this with first record from second table that is Raju 121 Raju 121 and again select nagendra to Second record Ramesh 122 again select nagendra to third recursion and 123. again select nagendra 2 combine this required with fourth record that is PSI 124 your first table condensed to record one two and similarly second table contains four records one two three four so two into four equal to Z so new table should contains total eight records we'll check whether there are I records or not one two three four five six seven eight total there are eight records this is known as Cartesian product here from first table we need to select each record and we need to combine that record with all these records in second table so again select second record and combine the second record with all these records in second table guys here two columns its name and its name both are common it is not mandated to have same columns for example your student table contains name column and project table contents its name column so even though if there are no similar columns we can perform Cartesian product so just this is my output this is known as Cartesian product Next Level expensive operations total there are three set operations they are union intersection and set difference I will explain each of them by giving example Cartesian product set operations and joins are performed on multiple tables so we can also call Cartesian product set operations and joins as binary relational operations this is definition of set operations in relational algebra set operations are used to manipulate and combine setup process from a table set operations are classified into three tips their Union intersection and set difference I'll explain each of them at first I will explain what is Union operation the union operation combines rows from two tables and forms a single table it retrieves all different rows from both tables and removes any duplicate rows this is syntax just write your table 1 Union table two yes you need to write your U symbol for Union I'll explain this Mass problem I will explain myself I'll explain one simple mathematical problem so that you can clear understand what is use of Union for example it is considered a contains one two three and similarly B contains three four five so Union will combine all different values so whenever I perform a union B I'll get output 1 2 and 3 so 3 is already present so just it will repeat three only once and four five this is my output so whenever I write here a union B I'll get output 1 2 3 is common in Setia there is three and in should be there is three so three will be repeated only once so it will select three only ones and four five this is my output whenever I perform a union B I'll get output 1 2 3 4 5. for example there is two end table and project table for example I want to perform Student Union project so just right here Student Union project so whenever I perform Student Union project that means it will combine these two tables and it will produce output so I'll get output it first will select first table that is 39 Suresh 14 and similarly second table contains II Shiva 30 and nagendra 40 but here PSI 2 will repeat it twice so even though if any record repeat it twice it will display only once here Union will order duplicate values so even though if any particular record repeated wise it will display only once so already PSI to L is present so it will not enter this I table just it will select Shiva this is my output whenever I perform Union operation next I will explain intersection operation the intersection operation reduce only the common rows between two tables guys whereas Union will select all rows and whereas intersection will select only common rows for example if you consider the student table this student table PSI table is common in both tables that is to entable condensed solutable and as well as project table contains I table so whenever I perform student intersection project I'll get output name psyro limit to L so just share it on your student intersection project so this record PSI table is common in both tables so I'll get outputs I rule number 12. guys this is syntax for intersection just United a table one intersection table two or you can also write relation one intersection relation to both are same this is simple mathematical example just say written here a equal to one two three and b equal to three four five in A and B 3 is common so whenever I perform a intersection B I'll get output 3 next I will explain what is set difference set difference will retrieve the rows from one table that are not present in another table I'll give one simple mathematical example so that you can clearly understand what is the set difference for example a contains one two three and B contains three four five we need to represent a difference with minus symbol so just a written here A minus B A minus b equal to here 3 is common in both A and B so it returns a rows that exists in first stable but that are not found in second table here 3 is present in both A and B so yes it will display output a contains only one two so I'll get output 1 2. similarly we'll perform set difference on two tables and names I and only material is common in two tables so it will not select this name PSI and rule number to well so it will select record from only first table so it will display output ramessrina Suresh 14. so whenever I perform student minus project I will get output except similar record it will spare remaining records from first table so remaining records are Ram is 13 and Suresh 14. this is my output for example here I return strain minus project but whenever I write your project management yes I and rule number 12 is common in both tables so it will display only Shiva 13 nagendra 40. this is my output whenever I perform project management joints guys this is a symbol that we use for joints joins are classified into two tips they are inner joints and outer joints in urgence Contents natural joint Theta joint and equi join and whereas outer joints content left outer John right outer Channel full out of joint I will explain each of them by giving examples at first I'll explain definition of joints in relational database management system join operations are used in relational algebra to comment rows from multiple tables based on common attributes or condition if there are common attributes then we need to combine those two tables I'll give an example so that you can clear condition water joints for example there are two tables one table is showing table and one is Department table student table contains its names I and Department one and similarly shivatri a similarly Department table contents Department name AML and ead1 and similarly CSC file if you see this student table in Department column there is one and similarly in Department table in did column there is one so one is present in both tables so just I am writing here student this is join symbol stream joint department and here I am giving condition that is department number equal to did here in department number there is one and here in did there is one so one equal to one so it will combine these two records so I'll get outputs I 1 aml1 and again here here this both values are not equal so it will display only PSI 1 aml1 this is my output insurance will combine tours based on common attribute guys rows and Records both are same this i1 is considered as one record or you can also call it as row join operations allows you to retrieve related information from different Tables by matching values in specific columns joins are classified into two types they are inner joints and outer joints advisory lesson what are inner joints and energy returns only the rows that I am matching values in specific Columns of both tables at first selection what is Theta join this is syntax relation 1 Theta relation to gas relation and table both are same you can also write here table 1 Theta table 2. Theta contains equal to not equal to less than greater than less than or equal to and greater than or equal to okay this is syntax for Theta join here you need to write relation one joint relation to not only equal to here you can use less than greater than less than or equal to or greater than equal to here you can give any condition I'll give one example so that you can clearly understand what is Theta join guys before performing any inertion operation at first you need to convert these tables into Cartesian product Cartesian product is nothing but for example in this table there are two records and similarly in this table there are two records so whenever you perform Cartesian product first table contains two records and second table contest two records so two into two total you will get four recourses output so for Cartesian product you will get four recursors output at first you need to select first record from first table and you need to combine this first a card with two records so at first I am writing PSI 1 AML Phi so PSI 1 AML Phi and next is PSI 1 cse1 so just seconds i1 cse1 so you need to combine this first record with all recursion Department table and similarly again you need to combine second record with all this records in second table so again I'm writing Shiva to AML Phi Shiva to cse1 so this is my output total there will be four records one two three four so this is my output for Cartesian product now we need to perform data operation data contains equal to not equal to greater than less than greater than or equal to or less than or equal to this example just I am writing a student join Department below this join I am writing department number equal to did guys we will perform this operation on this Cartesian product not on these tables if there is matching in department number and Eid then it should display the record as output so we need to check here department number this is department number column and this is did column no there is no matching yes here there is matching and again 2 5 there is no match and two one there is no match so whenever I write this mathematical operation this is my output PSI Department 1 CSC and did one this is my output similarly next I will perform less than operation so gesture written a strange on Department this is join symbol here I am given Theta condition that is department number less than Eid so if there is department number less than did I should get the complete record as output so here it will check this is department number and did so department number must be Legend here one is less than five this condition is satisfied and again here one is less than one this condition is not satisfied because one is not less than one one is equal to one so this condition is not satisfied and again here two less than five if this condition is suggested because 2 is less than 5 so it will display this record this record and again here two less than one no two is not less than one two is greater than one so this condition is not satisfied so whenever I write this mathematical operation I'll get output PSI 1 AML Phi and Shiva to AML Phi so whenever I run this mathematical operation I'll get output PSI 1 AML Phi and Shiva to ml5 this is my output this is known as Theta join next I will explain equation operation the name itself says equation that means we need to use equal to symbol this is syntax table 1 John table 2 here you need to give condition that is column in equal to column M I already explained this example this is example strain joint Department here I given condition department number equal to did only if there are matching values in department number and did I will get a complete record as output so this is my output so in this table only one and one are matching so I'll get output so I 1 cs1 so this is my output for equation operation next I'll explain natural join operation here for natural join operation we need to star symbol so table 1 start able to guys if you want to perform natural join operation then definitely there must be common columns for two tables if you see the student table instrument table there is department number column and similarly in Department table there is department number column so definitely there must be common names for two columns and similarly there must be common values so natural gen will combine these two columns and it will convert this column into single column so whenever I perform this operation so it will come on this department number column from two tables into single column showing it output name Sai Shiva department number one two and Department name AML and CSC natural channel will come in two columns into single column if there are common column names outer joins and outer Giants written all the rows from one table and the matching rows from another table if there is no match the result will contain null values outer joins are classified to three types they are left outer joined right outer gen and full outer join I'll explain each of them by giving example a left outer yarn returns all arrows from left table and the matching rows from right table if there is no match null values are included in right table this is syntax just relation one this is simple for less than just for join you need to write like this so relation one left joint relation two here you need to give condition I'll give an example guys there are two tables one is showing table and one is Department table so gesture written level department here are given condition that is department number equal to did that means they should be matching in this both columns so Liv John will return compare rows from left table and only matching rows from right table so this is my output so left table contains s name Department it will written complete rows so it will return PSI 1 and shivatri it will return complete rows and only matching values from right table D name and did here I given condition that is department number equal to did is there any matching value yes in department number there is one and did there is one so it will return this complete record is complete record that is AML and one but here department number is 3 and Eid is 5 there is no match so if there is no match it will display null values so null and null so definition of left outer join is left outer joint returns complete rows from left table and whereas only matching rows from right table if there is no match it will display null values and next I will explain what is write out version this is symbol for right outer join we need to write two lines right side so just I'm drawing two lines student right origin department and I am giving condition department number equal to did whereas left outers and returns complete record from left table and whereas right orders on returns complete record in write table so write table contents Department name and did and values are AIML and one CAC and Phi it returns complete rows from write table and similarly lift table contains s name and department number so a given condition department number equal to did so department number equal to DOD yes one is same in both tables so it returns this complete record that is PSI 1 and here department number is 3 and d8 is 5 there is no match so if there is no match it returns null values so it will explain all values in left table this is known as light Auto Chain whereas right outer chain will return complete rows from right table if there is matching left table it will display that complete row and if there is no match it will display null values next I will extend full outer joint Department here are given condition department number equal to did so s name department number D name and did these are four columns at first it will check whether department number equal to did is here department number equal to 1 and add equal to 1. so it will display this complete record so it will show PSI 1 aaml and one second row contains Shiva 3 and here csc5 there is no match so in left table it will show Shiva 3 and there is no match right side so it will display null values so you should condense complete rows from entire tables so full outer join should contain PSI 1 Shiva 3 and aml1 csc5 so here there is i1 and shiva3 and here there is AML one and here this one is left that is cacn5 is left so just I am writing a CSC and Phi and here there is no match so just I am writing null values left side so full version contains complete rows from left table and as well as complete Rose from right table yes there are two rows which is present in first table and there are two rows which is present in right table so this is known as full outer joint this is all about various relational operations and relational algebra guys in exam you may get question like explain relational operations or relational operators then you can write this question next I will explain what is relational calculus and then I will explain what is Tuple relational calculation domain relational calculus it first of all explain what is relational calculus relational calculus is a query language used in dbms to specify what data we want to retrieve from a relational databases gases relational calculus is nothing but it is a query language query is nothing but question for example we will question to our relational database like select the name of this trend whose rule number is 21. it is nothing but a question so relational calculus is a query Language by using this query language We can question to our database like what data you want to retrieve from a table this relational calculus is a non-presual query language that Focus only on what to do and not how to do it for example if you consider relational algebra relational algebra is a partial query language procedural query language mean it will focus both on what to do and as well as how to do it but whereas relational calculus is a non-presidential query language that means it Focus only on what to do and to not specify how to do it I'll give an example this simple example for example there is Trend table now I want to select complete record of send whose rule number is 21. so for that purpose I need to write this relational algebra operation that is Select the sigma stands for select select rule number equal to 21 from student table so whenever you perform this operation I'll get output it will display complete record option whose rule number is 21 so I'll get output names I rule number 21 here what I want to do is I want to select complete record option whose rule number is 21 and how can we do it we can do it by using selection operator the sigma symbol this is relational algebra operation so in relational algebra operation we specify what to do and as well as how to do it how to do it is nothing but will give procedure in order to find a book query so we call relational J Price procedural query language and whereas in relational calculus we'll focus only on what to do and we will not focus on how to do so we call this relational calculus as non-provision query language that means we will not give any procedure to solve a book query so it is a non-presidential query language that Focus only on what to do and not how to do it it will not describe about how query will work or how data will be fetched just it will explain what to do that's it there are two forms of relational calculus they are Tuple relational calculus and human relational calculus at first have election what is Tuple relational calculus gas Tuple is nothing but rho or we also call Tuple as record Tuple relational calculus is a non-presial query language that is used to retrieve data from relational databases if you want to retrieve data from tables then you can use to build relational calculus it is used for selecting tuples in a relation if certain condition is true these conditions are based on values present in rows of database table guys I will give an example so that you can clearly understand what is this triple relational calculus this is syntax of triple relational calculus weight T stands for Tuple right here bar and right here condition of t weight T stands for Tuple and condition of T is nothing but here we need to give condition in order to select tuples and we need to represent this in curly braces for example there is strange table Shrine stable condenses information now I want to select complete records of students whose age is greater than 20. guys here a message is 21 Suresh is 22 and Raja says is 23. now we need to select the center three recursors output guys just remember that this triple relational calculus will select enter Tube Plus output individual is nothing but it will select enter record as output so it will display name agent as well as grade of these three students Ramesh Suresh and Rajesh now I will write relational calculus query for this this is relational calculus query are nothing but rules bar from which table we are selecting from Schwinn stable we are selecting complete tables so JC written in your students of s various fluency stable name and here we need to give condition I don't want to select complete tuples I want to select only tuples whose age is greater than 20 so gesture returns H dot h greater than 20. so it will select complete tuples of students whose age is greater than 20 this is my output this is known as triple relational calculus if you want to select complete record that is if you want to select complete your pulse from table based on certain condition then you can use Tuple relational calculus triple variables are classed into two types they are free variables and next one is bounded variables variables which do not contains for all and there exist in condition is known as free variables and Tuple variables with for all and their existing condition is known as bounded variables and next I will explain what is domain relational calculus whereas triple mean rows or records and whereas domain columns I don't want to select complete record just I want to select name column so for that purpose you can use domain relational calculus domain relational calculus is same like Tuple relational calculus here we will select columns from a table based on condition it is also an unpredictable query language that means it Focus only on what to do and not how to do it in the mandrelational calculus we'll apply conditional columns not on tuples this is index inside curly braces you need to select columns columns and whereas F of C1 C2 C3 is once in its condition the same example I don't want to select compare record just I want to select name column just I want to select name column of students whose age is greater than 20 where your stands for Tuple so instead of writing s you need to write your name.s name dot is that means I want to select only name column this is domain relational calculus query and this is my output for example I want to select only grade column so just in place of writing name just write your grade

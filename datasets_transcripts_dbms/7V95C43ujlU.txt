[Music] hello everyone welcome back in this presentation let's focus on E diagram for University database we know DPMS has a widespread application areas mainly in banking in University Supermarket sales Enterprises marketing Railways or Airways reservation HR Telecom insurance Hospital management and whatnot all application areas are actually dealing with the real world entities where each entity is a real world thing or an object which is distinguishable from all other object so we can understand that dbms is inevitable when we are concerned with effectively storing the data and effectively retrieving the data as well as and when required in this presentation we will focus on how University database looks like please be noted that this University database may not be suitable for all universities because this is purely requirements based universities may have their own requirements so this ER diagram whatever we are going to see now is just a generic way of representation however as I mentioned this is requirement based before seeing the university database we should have a strong fundamentals about what is an entity relationship model or the entity relationship diagram how entity sets are represented a strong entity set is represented with a rectangle and a weak entity set is represented with a double rectangle coming to the relationship a strong relationship is represented with a diamond symbol a weak relationship is represented with double diamonds and we have other notations as well how attributes are represented there are different types of attrib rutes single valued attribute is represented with an ellipse composite attribute is represented like this multivalued attributes are represented with double ellipse derived attributes are represented with dotted ellipse we have null attributes as well if you are directly watching this lecture I would request you to watch my previous lectures on ER model and ER diagram to gain better insights and understanding now let's step into the ER diagram for the University dat database when we talk about University these two are the important pillars in the University database number one the instructor because a university cannot run without instructor and what's the next entity that is also inevitable the student entity obviously yes University contains instructors and students without any second thought now if you talk about the instructor entities what are all the attributes we have the instructor ID the name of the instructor and the salary this instructor relation may have any number of attributes considering the space constraints I'm just projecting only three attributes the instructor ID the name of the instructor and the salary of the instructor coming to the student entity or student entity set we are dealing with only three attributes the student ID the name of the student and the total credits If You observe these two are strong entities you know why because they have their own primary key attribute instructor has instructor ID as a primary key attribute similarly student also has a student ID as the primary key attribute so that these ID attributes helps us to identify the records uniquely all right we have seen about two entities instructor and student what is the relationship between an instructor and the student obviously it is the advisor relationship instructor advises students or students takes advice from the instructors so in this example I establishing advisor relationship between instructor entity and student entity and what kind of relationship is that can you see this is actually a one to many relationship because an instructor May advise many number of students but a student may have at most one advisor or instructor and that is why the relationship between instru instructor and the student is a one to many relationship now talking about the relationship it is a strong relationship you know why because this relationship is associated with two entities instructor and student which has their own primary key attribute which is the instructor ID for instructor relation and student ID for the student relation fine I going to construct the ER model with this way so at first we started with instructor and student entities which are connected with the advisor relationship which is a one to many relationship now let me bring in another entity set which is the department if you see all these are real world entities right instructor is a real world entity student is a real world entity department is also a real world entity in a university we cannot think about an ER diagram without Department because this is the one where instructor is also associated with and student is also associated with every instructor who is hired definitely will be belonging to a specific department or a particular Department similarly every student who is enrolled into the courses in the University will be definitely belonging to a department and that is why we are thinking about the next entity which is the department entity which has its attributes Department name the building and the budget as already mentioned considering the space constraints and projecting only The Limited number of attributes also this is requirements based and also this is assumption based in a generic way a university will have these many things now let's focus on how instructor entity is associated with the Department entity obviously there will be a relationship isn't it what's that relationship it's the relationship between the instructor and the department you can give any name instructor works for department or instructor joined in department but in a generic way I am representing it as instructor department so this is the relationship instructor Department which is connecting the instructor entity and the department entity what kind of relationship it will be obviously one to many can you see here one to many meaning a department may have many instructors but an instructor may have at most one department and that is why this is one to many is it something additional that you are noting here when compared to the relationship between instructor and student yes something is different here what do we mean by this double line meaning it is the total participation if you recollect in one of the previous lectures We have dealt elaborately about the participation constraints here there is a total participation can you see here this double line indicate the participation of instructor entity with the Department relation is total part participation what do you mean by that all the instructors who are working in this University will be definitely belonging to a department and that is why this is a total participation here my assumption is there are no adjunct faculty or No guest faculties as I already mentioned it's all dependent on the requirements so I am talking about the regular faculty members so I mean to say the instructor is definitely belonging to a department for sure and that is why all the instructors will be definitely working for a department and that is why the participation is a total participation all right we have establish the relationship between the instructor and the department we also know that we are going to establish the relationship between the student and the department what is that definitely student and Department are also associated with each other through student Department relationship you can give any names as per the requirement as already mentioned for generic notation I'm just giving student Department as the relationship between student entity and the department entity now what is the relationship this is also definitely a on to many relationship because a department may have many students but a student must be belonging to at most one department and that is why the relationship student department is a one to many relationship and what about the participation constraint here this is also having a total participation because all the students will be definitely belonging to some department so all the students will be participating in this relationship with the Department entity I hope things are clear to you now University is not limited only with these entities we have a lot more entities let's see the next entity the section now when we talk about the section again an instructor will be handling course for a particular section as well as a student will also be a part of a SE ction isn't it so in this case we have a section entity where both instructor and student are going to be related with each other at first let's focus on what is the relationship between instructor and section relationship is teaches obviously instructor is going to teach to a particular section and that's why we have a teachers relationship so instructor and section are related with teachers relationship so instructor teaches section and also if you note here this is a total participation because if you have a section definitely that section will be engaged in the teaching process with a specific instructor and that is why it is a total participation If You observe we have one to many relationship here here as well as here I mean advisers instructor Department student Department all three have one to many relationship what about this this is definitely not one to many because we have no arrows represented here so the relationship here is a many to many relationship many instructors may be engaged with many sections and that is why we cannot go for or think about one to one or one to many or many to one in a generic way it is a many to many relationship we are done with establishing the relationship between instructor and the section how using teachers relationship now coming to how section and student are related to each other takes students will be taking a particular section or a section will be having a set of students so obviously I am representing it with the takes relationship and what kind of relationship here there is no total participation however it is many to many now you may be asking why I have given a daughter line for the section ID attribute if you see the section entity that contains three attributes section ID semester and year there is no primary key here in fact section ID semester and year all three together should form a key in simple terms there is no primary key attribute in the section entity of course you can have dashed underlines for all three I mean section ID semester and year now one more interesting thing here is when we we say student and section has takes relationship obviously the student has student ID name total credits earned obviously students will be belonging to a particular section that has a section ID semester and year so in this particular semester and year what is the grade that student has taken so this relationship should reveal or should hold information about the grade related information so what do we mean by this it means this grade an attribute that is attached to this relationship set which is actually Tes relationship set this way of representing thing is known as attribute Associated to a relationship set takes between student and section is a strong relationship in all the cases everything is a strong relationship because there is at least one primary key attribute in each of this case except section entity now let's build this e diagram for furthermore let me bring in the course entity what do you mean by this obviously in a university there will be a set of courses where each course is identified using course ID each course will have a title and the maximum credits information so course entity will have course ID as the primary key attribute the title of the course and credits for example 301 database management system with the credits of four so 3 01 meaning the course ID title is database Management systems and the credits is three or four as per the university as you are aware all these are requirements based so we can say course is also an inevitable entity in the University database now when we talk about course each department will have their set of courses so this has to be related to the department relation I mean the course entity should be somehow related with the Department entity through some relationship also when we talk about section each course should be associated with the section as well because the sections are already associated with instructor and the student so student will be taking the course by enrolling into a specific section isn't it so after they are enrolled into the section they will be opting for specific courses similarly courses are offered by the departments at first let's see the relationship between this course and the section the relation ship between course and the section is the section course relationship now if you see this is a Double Diamond what does Double Diamond mean it means it is a weak relationship isn't it now what kind of participation it is a total participation and what kind of mapping cardinality it is one to many mapping cardinality and also if You observe here this is not a primary key attribute very very important please make a note of this since we don't have a primary key attribute anything in the section relationship that uniquely identifies things and that is why this entity we refer as a weak entity so the relationship between one strong entity course which has a course ID as the primary key attribute with the another entity which is not having a primary key attribute and that's why the relationship that is formed between the scores and the section entities is a weak relationship now let's see the Rel relationship between this course and the department obviously course is also associated with the Department with course Department relationship and this is also a total participation which is a strong relationship why because this is associated with two strong entities department and course ID which has their own primary keys and that is why this relationship a strong relationship whereas here this is a weak relationship let's build the CR diagram furthermore let's bring then the prerequisite relation which is this what do we mean by this you see this is a unary relationship this is not a binary relationship like others whatever we have seen a binary relationship which is actually Associated between two entities this is a binary relationship this is a binary relationship if you see all other relationships whatever we have discussed so far except this prerequisite is a binary relationship because they are associated with two tables or two entities if you see here this prerequisite relationship is actually a unary relation because it acts only on the course table why because we are going to represent two roles here what are the roles the course ID and the prerequisite ID let's assume the scenario if students wants to enroll in Java before taking the course Java students should have at least some object-oriented knowledge and that is why objectoriented programming may be a prerequisite course so if you see here this prerequisite is the relationship that deals with only one entity which is course where objectoriented programming course is also available here Java programming course is also available here let's take another example if students wants to enroll in cryptography and network security course obviously they should have the strong fundamentals about computer networks and that is why we can say computer network course should be a prerequisite for cryptography and network security all these relationship are existing inside the single entity and this relationship is a prerequisite relationship which deals with only one entity with the roles course ID and the prerequisite ID for example cryptography and network security course ID should be linked or associated with the prerequisite ID of computer networks I hope things are making sense to you let's build the Z diagram furthermore now let's bring in the class classroom which is an entity this classroom will be in a specific building with the room number and the capacity because when we think about real world entities these things are inevitable isn't it a classroom is also a real world entity which is described by building or building number room number and the capacity now each section needs a class isn't it now let's establish the relationship between section and the classroom so the relationship is actually section class relationship between a section and the classroom and what kind of relationship it is it's again one to many relationship relationship section class between section and classroom is having a total participation all the sections will be having a classroom and it's a one to many relationship now let's bring in another entity the time slot where time slot ID is a primary key attribute which is described by other comp opposite attribute day start time and end time as I mentioned these are all requirements based how this time slot is associated with a specific section which is through Section time slot and what kind of relationship it is it is a total participation with one to many relationship I hope things are clear to you if You observe this whole ER diagram this gives the overall logical structure in other words we can say this is a graphical representation which which is easy to implement if a database administrator sees this he knows how to construct the database with the database softwares it may be any software but he or she knows that there should exist an instructor entity with these attributes Department entity with these attributes and how they should be related to each other and what kind of participation it should be what kind of relationship it should be established whether it is one to one or one to many or many to one or many to to many similarly what kind of participation as well whether it is a total participation or partial participation and what kind of relationship as well in the whole picture if you see there are multiple relationships one is a Unity relationship as depicted here other things are binary relationship because it's acting on two tables or two entities I hope things are clear to you again I want to emphasize this is based on some assumptions now there is a homework question for you just keenly observe this and according to you what are all the assumptions that we have made here I'll give you one assumption here I have assumed that instructors will be all regular faculty members or regular instructors there are no part-time or guest faculties or adjunct faculties here all are full-time faculty members so this is one assumption I have made here just correlate this with your University database and find out what are all the assumptions that we have made here or in other other words how this University database is differing from the actual logic which is implemented in your University or in your college draft a paragraph about this and post your answers in the comment section I hope the session is interesting I'll see you in the next presentation and thank you for watching [Applause] [Music]

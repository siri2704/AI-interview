in this video we are going to discuss about schema and instance in dbms schema means description of a database description of database schema is mainly useful in order to design the database in order to design the database so before actually implementing the database before creating the table first we have to design the schema so schema is nothing but database design it mainly specifies description of the database the best example for the schema is if we take the construction of a house first we have to design the blueprint first we have to design a plan so that plan is also called as blueprint and then according to the blueprint the builder will build the house so that blueprint is nothing but database schema so schema means the logical description of the database the description of the database it is useful in designing the database if let us take the example of a student let us take the example of student relation our student table student table let the student table contains three fields so the first field is rule number second field is name and the third field is a box so here schema mainly specifies the relation name relation name is nothing but the table name here the table name is student and it specifies column names field names so what are the various fields here rule number name and marks let the roll number is of type some integer let name is of type some string let mocks is of type some real and we have to specify the constraints let here the constraint is here we are applying some primary key primary key let here the constraint is it should accept name means it should accept only all four bits alpha bits okay let length of the string is some 20 characters like that let this is some constraint likewise uh here also we can impose some constraints let here uh let the constraint here is some unique unique okay so schema means a relation or table name with the fields or the columns and data types and providing some constraints we have various constraints are there candidate key foreign key we will discuss all those constraints later so this this is about what is a schema so schema mainly contains this table name and then column names or field names along with along with data types and the possible constraints so this is about schema schema mainly defines the structure of the database schema mainly provides the description about the database now let us see what is instance instance means the content of the database the content of database or table yet yet a given point of time at a given point of time so instance means the content of database or table at a given point of time let me have a student table let the student table contains three fields rule number name mox let the roll number is one name is some ramesh marks 90. so now at this time student this table contains only one row so this one row is nothing but the instance of that table or the instance of the database after that let us assume that we have inserted two more rows so 2 mahesh 95 3 nourish 100 now what is the instance of this table now instance means this table now totally contains so many rows three rows so these three rows are nothing but instance of the database or table so that is nothing but what is instance the content of database or table yet a given point of time okay so this is about instance and schema in dbms so this is about schema and instance in dbms

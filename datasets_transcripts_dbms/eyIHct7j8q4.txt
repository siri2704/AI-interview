as we have seen in the last video that are types of relationship we will revise it relationships in diagram are binary ternary and Nary now we will study schema design principles effective schema design is Guided by principles such as normalization which reduce data rebend and denormalization which optimizes performance ading to these principles ensures a robust and efficient database structure good schammer design makes or breaks a database let's talk about two principles of schema designs that are normalization and denormalization in normalization it reduces rebury by structuring data symmetrically and systematically for example breaking one large table into smaller linked ones for the de normalization adds Rundy to improve performances like pre combining frequently accessed tables let's discuss when to use each of the best balance between performance and data Integrity as we we have studied the schema design principles now we will study the normalization process normalization has different levels that are 1 NF 2 NF and 3 NF normalization involves organizing data to minimize rebc it includes several forms such as 1 NF 2 NF and 3 NF each as addressing different types of anomalies proper normalization is essential for maintaining data integrity now we will study about 1 NF which is 1 NF is nothing but to ensure no repeating groups we can't repeat the groups in 1 NF for the 2 NF eliminate partial dependencies and 3nf remove transitive dependency that are three types of normalization processes which are really helpful for us that are one and of two and and in the real world application how we can use a diagrams we'll see now denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing reeny for performance optimization it can improve query performances but may complicate data Integrity understanding when and how to denormalize is crucial for Effective database management so denormalization it is about now we'll see about real world applications for the ER diagrams ER diagrams are used everywhere in banking they manage customers accounts in e-commerce they leave customers products and orders in healthcare they connect patients with the doctors and hospitals we'll use relatable example to highlight the versatility of a diagrams a diagrams are widely used in various Banks Healthcare Commerce they facilate better data management and decision making process showcasing their importance in real world database applications so in real world we can use AI diagram everywhere where we want to set data in a good way we can practice the ER diagram better way how we will see it best practices for ER diagrams to create effective ER diagram to best practice such as using clear naming clear conventions maintaining consistent notations ensuring completeness this practices enhance Clarity and usability in database design for the E diagrams here are some tips to create effective a diagram we have to use clear and consistent naming convention avoid clutter to focus on the Simplicity of the E diagram validate relation relationships and cardinality early it is really important in the conclusion we'll see understanding of ER diagram their components cardinality and relationship is essential for Effectiveness database schema design by applying these principles organization can enhance data integrity and optimize data database performance to sum up our e diagram Foundation of great database design understanding entities cardinality relationship and schema design ensure your database is both efficient and reliable if you found this video helpful please like And subscribe now we'll see the quick recap of our slides of today we have understood how diagrams are there are key comp components which are entities attributes relationships in this slide we we have seen how what are the types that are strong and weak for the entities it's about the cardinality explain that are one to many many to one and one to one there are types of relationship that are binary ternary and anary we have seen the schema diagram principle in which two types there are normalization denormalization in the normalization process there are types like 1 NF 2 NF and 3 NF there are forms for different addressing denormalization can be little crucial for Effective data management real world application we can use the AI diagram in banking e-commerce and Healthcare best practice for AI diagram is clear naming convention and consistent notation with a completeness that's it for today's video please like And subscribe

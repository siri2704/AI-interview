good evening everyone this is vishali in our previous session we discussed about normalization concept with example I have mentioned complete database management system playlist Link in below description box now in this session we will discuss about the next important topic that is views here we will discuss operations perform on view types of view with examples and at the end we will discuss table versus view so let's start the session the first thing is what exactly views in dbms so view in SQL or dbms considered as a virtual table how see here in this example consider that this is a student table there is student role number student name and marks so for that one table there are total three views first View for the teacher teacher can view complete table like roll number name and marks next student can view only roll number and name marks column hide from the student and next office staff office staff can view only name of the student roll number and Max column hide from the office staff right means there is only one table and there are total three views of that particular users so these views are called as virtual table right means you can view the particular table as per the Restriction as per the add authorized person or as per the requirement so this is called as view you can perform this operation create view update View and delete view on The View we already discussed physical level logical level and view level structure in previous session I have mentioned link of that video in description box so view means your virtual table and every user is having the different views next the first operation is create view so you can create view on single table or you can create view on multiple table so let's take the example in your database these two tables have stored one is student details another one is student marks student details having ID name and address and student Max having ID name and marks clear now you need to create a view on single table okay so first we will see this thing how to create a view on single table now the problem statement is you need to view the table or you need to give the restrictions to the user to see only name and address in this particular table okay not a ID how see here so create view this is the syntax create view view name and the view name is details view this is a view name you can give any other name okay as select column name so which column you need to see name or address only from table name table name is student details where ID less than equal to 4 so less than equal to 4 means only 1 2 3 for this ID name and address will be shown to the user see here after executing this view you need to select star from details view okay and after executing this instruction your output is this name address and there are three student name and their address right so this is called as virtual table of the main table now you can create a view on multiple table suppose you need to create a view on both tables okay how see here create View and your view name is Max view okay as select and your column names so which columns you need to see or restricted to the users the First Column is name from student details so student details dot name second column student details dot address that is this address column and third column is Max from student Max so student Max dot marks means you can create a view from multiple tables now from table name so there are two table name student details and student marks where the condition is student details dot name equal to studentmax.name so here in this name there are total four name Rahul Sarah Rohit and part and in the student Max table there is also same four name but this name is different only okay means they can show the result of only the same name our condition is student details dot name equal to student marks name so you need to fulfill this condition now for displaying The View you need to perform this query select star from view name and your view name is Max view okay so output is name address marks there are total three columns and their result so in this way you need to create view on single table as well as multiple table as per your requirement now the next operation is update view so you can update the view column as well so let's see here so this view you already created right you already created this view previously now you need to update view update view means suppose you need to update a particular condition like here we will display only name and address now you think that you you have to display ID name address both three columns right so how to update this uh this particular query so for update purpose you need to use create or replace these words okay so create or replace View and your view name is same details view as select name and address here is a name and address now you need to update the query so update query just add the column name like ID name and address and remaining query as it is so after executing this bigquery select star from details view so this particular output will be generated means first there is a name and address only and after updating you add the ID column now the output is ID name and address right so for updating purpose we use create or replace this word right and remaining syntax as it is next the next thing is delete view suppose you need to delete view from the database so how to delete see here so for deleting purpose you need to use drop keyword okay see here so this view you already created okay previously that is name and address now you need to delete those views how directly you can use drop View and view name so drop View and your view name is details view okay so when you execute this kind of query your view have deleted right so this is called as delete view so you can create multiple view on single table or multiple table or you can update the view as per your requirement or you can delete the view by using drop command clear next now there are different types of fields okay the first view is simple view simple view means it restrict the user to access only one table means you can perform the operations only on one table so this is called a simple view the next one is complex view complex view means register the user to access more than one table means the particular user access more than one table by using Group by where or any other function the next one is horizontal view so when you perform horizontal view at that time user can access only selected row of the table means some rows have hided from the user only selected rows it can be displayed vertical view means only selected column will be displayed to the particular user remaining columns have hide and Metalized view means it create a complete copy of one table Suppose there is a one table that is student table stored in database so this metallized view create a copy of that table as it is and perform the operations on that copied table so this is called as metallized view next the last concept is view versus table what exactly difference between that so basically table means your actual table this table stored in database and view means virtual table Miss every users having different view or different display of that particular table so this is called as virtual table right the next difference is see here you can create a table in your database means you can perform insert or alter update this kind of operations means you on the data means you can change the data right you can create a structure of table but in view your table structure already created right means you need to just perform operations on displaying purpose not on manipulation or not on data purpose right next table is independent or data object you can create table independently in database but view is completely depend on table you can't change row name or column name in view view can display the actual table as it is as per the requirement right so this is the difference between View and table hope so you understood the concept of views thank you keep learning

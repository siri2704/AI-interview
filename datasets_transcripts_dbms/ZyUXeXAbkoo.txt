we'll be going into the functional dependencies and uh the decompositions also coverti mana almost basic slow in the last video next we're gonna see it'll be more depth than mata so eocodalo third indian only enroll nsra lucky participants key they can win amazon watches up to rupees 5000 rupees okay so basically 20 various kind of uh goodies and freebies the part two questions top educators including questions which are going to be on aptitude and reasoning so basically so that you can kind of prepare well that can be forget or placements whatever shall i help out with description of linkedin you can check it out okay guys so topic local kilopodam first thing let's say monaki oka yeah diagram is of something of this sort okay i have a student to nado and we have these kind of maybe entries to it like marks or serial number or roll number one together fine maybe this is a so serial number will be a column roll number will be a column phone number column marks is also a column okay but let's say we have name here okay name simple the interval will be having first name middle name and last name namely separated in the country if we are writing only name i mean if you are writing in this way serial number roll number and name and jpeg single column great yesterday it will not be sufficient because we are having three fields into it i think the screen is visible okay so here i couldn't find conte we have individual fields into it so it will be roll number serial number first name middle name last name marks and phone number so it will be something of this sort so monkey first name is separate columns okay the next one is let's say maybe kicker because if the very table the link outside we can get the or extract the details properly employee is a table in them or employ your identity will be having something called employee number or employee id and another dhani we'll keep it inside this also so many samantha dependents labor will be having employee number maybe dependent name phone number this is all common so basically employee number we will not have it as a direct attribute but this will be a foreign key so this will be pointing to the employee number of the entity which corresponding to the employer model okay then next and let's see if we have one needy here and one entity here may be department already and employee okay obviously we'll have a relationship and many times relation coda there can be attributes together so along with the the entities having attributes okay this is common then it is added on n side and mutter one is to a night again inside so quella if it is uh initial one and a d one is okay now let's see if it is ms to n okay if it is not one but m and n apparently and they basically we will be creating a separate table for this attribute alone and industry may be employee is one entity okay and maybe relation and may be project encoded and obviously employee works for a project so basically any hours work she said employ a project in the another because single employee can work on multiple projects and single project can be handled by multiple people capability m student so you can keep or maybe age and project pid project id is the primary key and obviously make a primary candidate watch the previous videos so pid and maybe project name and maybe department even though okay so basically what we will do is we will create separate table for hours but point indian day the inflow so this will become the foreign keys got it yeah and finally what if we have multi-valued attributes until let's say we have again employee or student whatever employer okay so employee will have what obviously employee id this is the primary key the android part he can have name so namely maybe we can have first name and last name and let's say we have phone number okay but problem indian day phone number can have multiple entries and the single employee may be ram anyway so this employer can have maybe five phone numbers okay next is xiaomi jp so he can have maybe only one phone number so this will be varying across all the employees so dee neela name and last name because chippenham in naga if it is having uh multiple fields into it separately create just them okay but what about the phone number then so phone number okay separated so so again here it will be the foreign key to this obviously employee id plus phone number indigo why not only employ id and a because let's say employee id one can have phone number xyz again employee id one can have abc and a phone number coder but it is not unique property the primary key will be the employee id plus phone number both so nikola one one ras another so it is this way so maybe employee one key express done in phone number under two again one abc 1.2 how about t it is not unique power t we cannot keep employee is a single primary key so i hope it was clear so this is the way how we can convert er model into relational model next video we will discuss functional dependencies and then maybe decompositions also yeah that's all for now guys thank you very much jai hind

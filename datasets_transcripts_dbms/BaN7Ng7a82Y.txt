welcome to learncomputerscienceonline.com and in this video we are going to discuss what is entity relationship diagram different components of entity relationship diagram and how it is used in the database management system dbms we will also discuss in detail various symbols used in the er diagram its meaning concept of entity relationship cardinality and other related important topics let us first start with a quick introduction to the er model the entity relationship diagram erd is a graphical representation of the database structure the entity relationship diagram is also alternately referred to as er model or er diagram in simple words the entity relationship diagram is a blueprint that can be used to create a database using a specific database management system rdbms we can compare this with architectural drawings and architect create blueprints before building a house similarly the database designers create different types of data models or database blueprints to visualize the database structure during the database design stage the database designers prepare various data models to visualize the database structure the er model is one of the data model called as the conceptual data model used by the database designers to describe the database structure okay let us now understand different components of entity relationship diagram the er model consists of four major components these components are first the entity second the attributes third the relationships and the fourth the cardinality let us start with the first concept of entity in the database design in dbms world the database entity is represented by a table during the database design process the first task for the database designers is to identify various objects or business concepts that needs to be represented into the database the entities are either physical objects or business concepts that helps to uniquely describe that particular object or a business concept let us try to understand the concept of an entity with few examples for example if we are designing a database for a college then the entities that needs to be represented into the college database would include first the student second the teacher third the courses fourth the departments fifth the department heads and other such similar entities similarly if we are designing a database for a company then the entities that needs to be represented into the company database would include first an employee second the department third employee salary fourth the management fifth the inventory and other such similar entities as you can notice in the above two examples some of these entities have physical existence whereas some entities are merely business concepts the business concept such as the bank account loans given by the banks educational courses are also examples of valid entity such conceptual entities are represented by an entity in the database design that we wish to record the information about into the database the entity is shown in the er diagram as a rectangle shape and the relationship between the two entities is indicated by a diamond shape the er diagram use different types of entities the entity types used in the er diagram include 1. strong entity 2 weak entity 3 tangible entity 4 conceptual or intangible entity let me explain the concept of strong entity an entity is said to be a strong entity when it has a key attribute that is prime attribute that can uniquely identify each instance of an entity for example the employee id attribute for an employee entity and similarly the student id attribute for the student entity are examples of the strong entity in er diagram the strong entity is shown by a single line rectangle the second type as weak entity an entity is said to be a weak entity when it does not have a key attribute that is prime attribute that can uniquely identify each instance of an entity the weak entity is dependent upon other strong entity for its existence into the database schema for example the employee entity is a strong entity whereas the employee address employee nominee are examples of the weak entities because their existence depends upon the employee entity in er diagram the weak entity is shown by a single double rectangle the third entity type as tangible entity an entity is said to be a tangible entity when it has a physical existence that can be recorded in terms of its attributes the fourth entity type as conceptual entity an entity such as bank account mortgage loan are said to be a conceptual or intangible entity when it does not have a physical existence but it is a valid business concept that can be recorded in terms of its attributes okay let us now move on to discuss the second component of the er diagram and that is the concept of an attribute in dbms world the database entity is represented into the database in terms of its attributes and entity attributes are used to describe the various properties of an entity an entity can have a single or many attributes that can be recorded into the database with the help of its attributes the entity can have different types of attributes in rdbms a table represents an entity and the table columns represent the attributes let us discuss few simple examples to understand the meaning of and attributes in the context of database design for example the student entity can be recorded into the database using its attributes such as the student id first name of the student last name of the student date of birth the course title enrolled by the student and other such attributes similarly the mobile handset entity can be recorded into the database using its attributes such as the mobile model number the stock id the brand name the model type the date of purchase and other such attributes in er model the attributes of an entity are indicated by an oval shape connected to the entity rectangle by a straight line different types of attributes are indicated differently into the er diagram depending upon the property of the attribute values different types of attributes are used in the database design the different types of attributes include 1. prime attribute 2 non-prime attribute 3. simple attribute 4. composite attribute 5 derived attribute 6 single value attribute 7 multi-valued attribute the different types of attributes are shown in the er diagram using various variations of an oval shape the prime attribute can function as a primary key that can uniquely identify each record in the relational table in er diagram the prime attribute is shown by a underline in the oval shape the composite attribute such as student name can consist of two attributes for example the first name attribute and the last name attribute the derived attribute such as student age attribute is calculated and its value depends upon the date of birth attribute the derived attribute is not stored into the database in er diagram the derived attribute is shown by a dotted line oval shape the multi-valued attribute such as student mobile number can have multiple values for example the student can have more than one mobile number in er diagram the multi-valued attribute is shown by a double line oval shape so far we have discussed the concept of database entities and its attributes let us now move on to discuss the third important component of the er diagram and that is the concept of relationship between the entities let us first define the concept of a relationship the relationship between the two entities is defined as an association through which the two entities are logically related to each other for example the student entity and the course entity are related to each other when the student joins the course in er model the relationship between the two entities is indicated by a diamond shape connected to the entity rectangles by straight line on either side however in relational model the relationship between the two entities represented by respective tables is defined by creating a primary key and foreign key constraints for each table let us now discuss the fourth and the final component of the er diagram and that is the concept of cardinality cardinality ratio and the mapping of cardinalities in er model a relationship between the two or more entities is an association among the entity instances of one or more instances of another entity sets the cardinality ratio or mapping cardinalities is an important concept that describes the binary relationship set in simple words we can call this relationship types expressed in terms of maximum number of instances of one entity set that can be associated with the maximum number of instances of the other entity set in a given relationship different types of cardinality ratios or mapping of cardinalities include first one-to-one relationship second one-to-many relationship third many to one relationship fourth many-to-many relationship let me first explain the one-to-one relationship in one-to-one relationship only one instance of the entity set a can be associated with any one instance of the entity set b and vice versa for example in a college a department head can head only one department similarly each department can have only one department head the next relationship type as one-to-many relationship in one-to-many relationship one instance of entity a can be associated with more than one instance of entity be for example an employee can work only in one department but many employees can work in one department the next relationship type as many to many relationship in many to many relationship many instance of entity a can be associated with given instances of entity b similarly many instance of entity b can be associated with given instances of entity a for example an employee can work on more than one project likewise many employees can work on one project all right at the end the er diagram is an easy to use graphical tool used in database design process to understand the database structure that brings us to the end of this video tutorial and in this tutorial we have discussed in detail what is entity relationship diagram we have also covered in detail all the four important components of er model which include the concept of database entity its attributes what is relationship and the

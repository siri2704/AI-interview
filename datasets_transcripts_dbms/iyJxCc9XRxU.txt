Hello friends! Welcome you to Gate Smashers In this video I am going to explain Introduction to PL-SQL And for this video many students were requesting Their comments were coming Mails were also coming That you definitely make an introductory video on this Actually this portion Is not important from Gate point view Because in Gate SQL is important But in other competitive exam Like KVS exam is there DSSSB exam Or if you talk about any other competitive exam Where SQL is the main portion Like if you talk about Oracle Certification Or now even in 11th and 12th SQL portion is there So over there also Basic PL-SQL comes That's why in this video I am going to explain introduction to PL-SQL We will start First of all What is the meaning of PL-SQL over here? Procedural SQL Procedural SQL means When we study normal SQL Structural Query Language  Now this Structural Query Language By default it is of which nature? It is declarative i.e declarative in nature What is the meaning of declarative That language where we explain Where we write what to do We just write what to do but how to do That we don't mention Why we don't mention that Because we just have to find out That I am given a question I have to find out name, salary Or I have to find particular detail So in a single query Maximum SQL query that you have seen They are usually completed in 1-2 line But now we are adding in it Programming flavour Programming flavour means As we do in C programming We declare function We give function definition We make procedures Triggers are there Over here we have cursors All these points That we are now putting in SQL And after adding the in SQL You can say that it is an advanced SQL portion And it is named as PL-SQL, Procedural SQL So now what is this? This is declarative plus Procedural Now what we have to do in this? And how to do You are going to explain both What is the meaning of how to do Like you have to find sum of 2 numbers Now to find sum of 2 numbers You declared it Let's say a,b Gave them values But, now how to do means You will have to make a function You will have to give definition Like c=a+b And you did printf(c) Now you have printed c So what will be the output, addition of both Means you are explaining both what to do and how to do So that becomes your Procedural SQL In this which topic come In this topic comes function Procedure, trigger, and cursor Form which the most important is Procedure And Trigger Which is the most important portion Because somewhere Most questions come on them There is not a lot of difference between function and procedure It's working is same There is just some difference of syntax But, if we talk about any PL-SQL block  We also call this PL-SQL block or PL-SQL code See in SQL whenever you will get a question It will come like this only Write a query They will ask some question after this But always how it will start, write a query to find this Write a query to find this But, over here you will get question Write a PL-SQL code Or write a Program Means now ahead on programming, somewhere Now you will have to write program For sum of 2 numbers, fibonacci series You have to make pattern Any this type of question that we do in normal C We do in C programming That question only now you can do In SQL and that will be your PL-SQL And whatever code is there Whatever block is there Of PL-SQL We divide them basically in 3 portions First portion is declaration Where we declare as we simply declare variables in C int a, int b In the same way over here we declare But the way of declaring over here is opposite First the variable name Then datatype a int, b int, char is there varchar is there Other then that we have number Any datatype any variable you want to declare So first of the PL-SQL code  In that first you have to do declaration After that we have executable Executable code Executable code means That what you have to execute Like if we do sum of 2 numbers So in sum of 2 numbers I have declared first of all We will declare and start Like a int b int This way I have taken 2 variable We will take one more let's say c int We have declared Now after this executable code Executable code always starts with begin In that as we give normal brackets In this way { } Over here here we write begin and end We write executable code between begin and end so we did begin And in begin we have written Suppose we have given the value of a  10 value of b we have given 20 And c we have written as a+b c:=a+b And we write this : to pass the value If we will write normal = What is the normal =over here? it will work like assignment But if we want to pass the value over here If we want to pass the value Then over there we will have to give := We use normal = to compare 2 things Are equal or not So this is the way to write the basic code Declaration portion is there after that executable code is there In which between begin and end Whatever line I want to execute That we write over here And 3rd is over here Exception handling Exception handling Exception handling means If you want to raise any error If you want to raise any error manually Then that error, like divide by 0 error So then you can define this errors in this exception handling portion You will write any PL-SQL program In that somewhere You have to write about this 3 portions only in the code So this is the basic introduction Of PL-SQL And in this next we will discuss about procedures In the next video Thank you

SQL and nosql are two different types of database Management Systems dbms SQL databases are relational databases while nosql databases are non-relational databases this means that SQL databases store data in tables while nosql databases store data in different ways such as key value pairs documents or graphs structure SQL databases have a predefined schema which means that the structure of the data must be defined before the data is stored nosql databases on the other hand have a dynamic schema which means that the structure of the data can be changed at any time scalability SQL databases are vertically scalable which means that they can be scaled up by adding more powerful Hardware nosql databases on the other hand are horizontally scalable which means that they can be scaled out by adding more nodes to the database cluster SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transaction management nosql databases on the other hand are typically used for applications that require high performance and scalability such as web applications and mobile apps

hello everyone in this video i am going to discuss about one too many many to one and many too many actually how the questions are coming they are giving you a year diagram and after that they are asking you that how many minimum number of table will be required now students are getting confused how to do the minimum number of table where i can join the relationship what is the meaning of joining the relationship that's why please watch this video till the end and definitely subscribe to the channel click the bell icon to get all the latest update and notification i will take practical example through the practical example your concept will be total clear and ultimately you will be able to solve all types of question from this area so check it here i am taking a two table with this two table only everything will be clear one table is employee double another table is departmentable okay so in employee table there is two attribute that is e m p id here there is e m p id and e m p nim right and in department there is two attribute that is d id i'm writing in short and another one is d name taken now now see that one employee can work for only one department one employee what is the relation see try to understand the relation one employee can work for only one department i am writing here that one employee can work for one department right but in one department in one department there can be multiple employees there can be multiple employee right now how to do the relationship how to do the relationship to do the relationship definitely either this is the primary key employee id and this is the primary key department id now either you have to take the employee id as the foreign key here or you have to take the department id as a foreign key here right so check that that there is the maybe employee id is e1 e2 and e3 three employees are there here is d1 d2 and d3 three department are there okay now if i am writing here if i am taking here e id as the foreign key can i join like that see that may be in department one there is who is working who is working in department one maybe maybe employee ids or one is also working employee three is also working in department one it can be possible that employee one is also working and employee two is also working right now can you do that can you do that in one attribute can you feel it like comma separated this is not possible because in in rdbms as it is the relational database model r b b a miss the multivalued attribute are not allowed when you are writing this way this is called multivalued this is not allowed right that's why it is not allowed i cannot do this right i cannot do this so what i can do i can add here a department id i can add here a department id because one employee can work for only one department maybe employee one is also working in department one and employee three is also working in department one and employee 2 is working in department 2 so there is no problem is it or not so what is the relationship here here check that the cardinality this is called the cardinality means one is how they are relating with other one so here the cardinality of employee is one because one employee can work for one department and here the cardinality for department is m because one department can have multiple employee now how we are writing it it is one it is m and this is a very important concept what is this relation is it one too many or many to one no it is see that this one is coming here and this aim is coming here so that's why this relationship will be many to one this is called m21 many to one it is aim is to one relationship okay this is very important to understand this one is one how we will read it one employee can work for one department one department can have multiple employee that's why here the relationship is many to one and with which part you can add the relationship you can add the relationship where the cardinality is one because employee have the cardinality one that's why you are adding the department id with the employee now how many tables will be required minimum number of tables are required right because department as it is how it was but with the employee we are combining the did as a relationship so that ultimately with the minimum number of 2 table it is done got it now if i am changing it just change it to if the same thing if you are changing it to many to 1 that many to 1 we have done and if it is one too many then in the one part same way you can do because just in the reverse right now if it is many too many now the problem can come with the many too many because already we have done many to one and one too many will be same way same way but when it is many too many many too many how the many too many can be possible like the student it is a student table and it is a course table okay one student can take multiple course and in one course can have multiple student this is called the money too many so here it will be the student id and they are the student name and here this will be the course id and here it will be the course name now can you add here course id can you add here course id maybe student one is taking course may be here it is one two three four so many courses are there here also so many courses are there i am taking course one course two course three in that way maybe student 1 is taking the course c 1 c 2 c 3 is it possible not possible i cannot do here now can i do here student id s id one course can be taken by multiple student that is can be s1 s2 s3 not possible because there is also multiple problems coming multivalue so it is also not possible so what we have to do now we have to do here we have to create a separate table in this table there it will be sid and cid maybe sid student one is taking course one student one is taking course two student one is taking course three student 2 is taking course 4 student 2 is taking course 5 in that way there will be no problem there will be no multivalued problem right so for the m2m well there is many too many sometimes we are writing m2 n also both are actually same concept is multiple student one student can have multiple courses and one courses can have multiple student so for the m2n when it is m2m then you have to create a separate table so here how many tables will be required three tables will be required okay so whatever whatever how many uh entities are given how many relations are given always remember that if it is many too many then always you have to take another separate table for the relation right so ultimately what is coming to the final point the final point is coming there that if it is one too many or many to one then we can combine then we can combine the relation with the table with the table of cardinality 1 whose cardinality is 1 with that you can combine don't read that like the many parts sometimes somewhere they are telling that with the many part we are combining that is wrong concept because one too many and many to one is like that if here the cardinality is one and here the cardinality is many then we are telling this is m and this is one that is many to one okay and if this is i am changing that it is m and it is 1 then this will be here this one will come here and this m will come here then it is one too many always remember conceptually where the cardinality is one like in the employee one employee can work for one department that's why we are combining the relationship with the employable because employee have the cardinality one so just check it here if i am changing that this is my employee table and this is my department table then it will be your one to many then with the employee part you will do it don't remember like that key is the m part no it is the cardinality one where the cardinality is 1 with that part i can combine right and whenever it is the many too many for the many too many always create a new table you have to create the new table for the relation this is the concept of one too many many to one and many too many and another sometimes another problem is coming if there is any multi-valued attribute how they are giving the multi-valued attribute in a entity if it is given like double bar that is called a multi-valued attribute like the phone number phone number is a multi-valued attribute one student can have multiple phone number so then if it is a student table if it is srd if there is phone number can you write down this is the phone number one for number two not possible right that's why for the then for the phone number table also you have to create a separate table that is sid will be there and here phone number will be there for the sid one some phone number is there for the sid one again some phone number sid two some phone number they decide to do some phone number is there so for the multivalued attribute also you have to take to one separate table so remember that whenever there is multi-valued attribute then create a separate table so this is all about how many minimum number of stables are required i hope your concept is clear after that i will share you some uh question if you are interested please let me know that you need the practice question i will share the practice question yesterday also we have done normalization concept you can watch the normalization concept video if you are interested then i will share you the practice question hope you like this video please like share and subscribe to the channel thank you bye bye

in this video we are going to discuss about relational model in dbms database management system relational model is the most popular data model nowadays we are using relational model only so we know that naviers we are using rdbms relational database management system relational database management system uses relational model only okay first let's see what is the advantage of a relational model relational databases store data in relations so what is a relation relation is nothing but a table relation means a table relation is a table so what is the major advantage here relational databases stores data in relations so relation is nothing but a table we know what is a table table is a collection of rows and columns here each relation must have an unique name now let us see various terminologies in relational data model before that let us take a relation let name of the relation is student so we can call here student as a relation or table so relation is nothing but a table we know what is a table so table means a collection of rows and columns so let us see the let us draw the table so here what is the name of the relation the name of the relation is student relation let it has mainly four columns the first column is rule number the second column is name third column is mocks fourth column is branch first student details let the roll number is one let name is some ramesh marksum 90 branch cse next second student information mahesh mox 95 branch id so third student information let name is naresh mox summati branch ec so this is our relation name of the relation is student now let us see various terminologies that we use as in relational model the first two terminology is attribute or we can call as field or column or column so what is attribute or field the column names of your table column names of relation column names of relation is called as attribute or field or column so in this relation what are the column names rule number next name mox and branch so these four are the column names so we can say that roll number name mocks and branch are called as we can call these as attributes are fields are columns now let us see the second terminology the second terminology is tuple or record our row so here tuple or record or row means each the row of a relation the row of a relation is called as tuple or record or row here how many rows are there one this is the first row second row third row so totally we have three rows are there so these three are called as table so one so this is one temple this is another temple this is another temple so what is temple tuple means rows of relation rows of relation is called as tapul now let us see the next terminology that is domain what is domain domain means set of possible attribute values so attribute values called as domain so if you take this relation what are the attribute values so roll number is 1 1 ramesh 90 cse so these are the attribute values 2 95 i t these are the attribute values 3 nourish 80 ec these are the attribute values attribute values are called as domain here attribute values are atomic the attribute values are atomic atomic means attribute values cannot be divided further so we can't divide those values further further cannot be divided further so let the attribute value is mahesh space babu so we can't divide mahesh space babu into two values okay we can't divide these into further okay so this is called yes domain domain means attribute values okay uh if you take the example of here branch so what are the attribute values c a c i d e c mechanical so those are the attribute values if you take student yes so what is the student is the possible attribute values may be from 1 to 25 1 to 25 so these are the attribute values if you take employee is so employees may maybe from some 20 to 17 20 to 70 if you take married status so the possible attribute values are either married or unmarried so those are the attribute values and the next attribute value is next one is none so null means if attribute value is unknown if the attribute value is unknown so if you don't know what is the attribute value then we can say that it is null so let us assume that here we don't know the marks of nourish so this is called yes null why because at this time we don't know the marks of nourish okay so that is the that is null let us see the next terminology the next terminology is cardinality of your relation cardinality of your relation so what is cardinality of relation cardinality means number of rows are tuples present in the relation so how many tuples are there here one two three three tuples so cardinality of student relation is three cardinality of student relation is three and the next one is degree of relation degree of your relation so degree means number of attributes number of attributes or fields or columns of the relation of the relation if you take student relation here we have four attributes rule number name marks branch so cardinality of the student relation is one two three four so one two three four now let us see some more terminologies so the next terminology is a relational model so what is relational model so next to terminology seventh one relational model so relational model means set of relations set of relations set means collection so collection of relations with distinct relation names with different relation names with distinct relation names if you take university so in university database we will have several relations like student relation faculty relation again in faculty we will have two types teaching faculty non-teaching faculty subject relation mocks relation likewise we can have several relation so that is nothing but relational model a collection of relations with different relation names okay in university we can have several relations like student staff non-teaching staff uh next mock subject likewise okay now let us see the next one the next one is relational schema relational schema so what is relational schema relational schema mainly describes the relations relation schema mainly describes relations relational schema is made up of made up of relation relation and attributes and attributes of relation and attributes of relation so here in this example what is the relation so student is the relation whereas what are the attributes so rule number comma name comma marks comma branch so this is about relational schema so what is the purpose of relational schema it is mainly useful in order to describe the relation so for this we need relation as well as attributes of the relation so student of rule number comma what are the attributes name comma marks comma branch so this is relational schema now let us see the next one that is uh relational dbms so what is relational dbms relational dbms means set of relation schemas set of relation schemas and set of integrity constraints and set of integrity constraints integrity constraints so relational dbms means set of relational schemas so like student we can have several relations okay those schemas and set of integrity constraints we have different integrity constraints like primary key foreign key candidate key we will discuss about all those integrity constraints in the future videos now let us see the last terminology that is relational instance so what is relational instance at a given time at a given time number of tuples so at a given time how many tuples are there so that is nothing but relational instance so at this time so we have three tuples are there let us assume that after some time we have deleted two rows from the table so if we delete these two rows then the table will contain only one row so now relational instance means what at this time this relation contains only one tool okay so this is about relational instance this is about relational model in database management system

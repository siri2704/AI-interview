hey everyone welcome back in this video we will be learning more about databases and understanding how data is stored in a database data is stored in a structured format using tables think of table like an Excel sheet where data is organized in a rows and columns once again go on and open your SS SMS and use your testing environment or use Adventure Works database go on and open your tables and as you can see we have multiple tables in our adventure Works database as I previously said in previous videos this adventure Works database is for testing provided by Microsoft so let's select from one of the tables let's select from this table and as you can see we have lot of information here right so columns are located over here and if you open it you can see that we have multiple columns in these tables we have address line one address line two and so on so these are all the columns as you can see from the output we have this colum names included so what is row this is row this blue line here or this blue line here is a row so this is column and this is row so understanding difference between columns and rows are very important each row is a unique entry and each column represents a specific type of information information a key is a unique identifier that helps to find specific data in tables quickly so we have different kind of Skys in SQL server but not only in SQL server in in other database Management Systems so we have primary key foreign key and unique key so let's start discussing each one of them separately go on and click on new query and let's create our testing database where we will be creating different tables with different columns and with different keys go on and type create database test for example let's create this database refresh your databases and let's first create just a table without any kind of keys so creating table is very straightforward and very easy for example you can create table let's call it again test and you can have different kind of columns here for example ID which is in first name which is vchart for example 15 last name again barart 15 so if you don't know what is in barart what is an INT and if you want to know more about sqol server data types I have separate video about it and I will leave the links for the video in this description so for now let's continue let's create this table and let's insert something in it values for example as for ID let's give it one as for first name let's give it brain will this is my YouTube channel name and let's say in last name include subscribe if you haven't subscribed to my channel for now go on and click on that subscribe button so let's insert this information and let's select from our table so this is our output for now so what if we want to make sure that our ID is Not Duplicate in our table for example if I run this command again one more time for example one more time this ID is same for example one one one one right but what if I want to create a table with something some kind of restriction that gives me possibility to somehow restrict user inserting information that is duplicated for my columns for example you are creating your table for customers right your customer each customer should have individual IDs for example say ID which is in for that you will be using primary key with this primary key you are able to restrict user from insert multiple for example ones so you will be making sure that there will be no duplicate values also take take in consideration that primary key does not allow null values so you will not be able to insert null value when you are using primary key so we have ID primary key and let's copy paste this first name and the last name and we have our customer table right now now let's start inserting something in it in customer table and values as for values again one again brain wheel and again subscribe so if I execute this one it will insert something but if I try to execute once more it says that there is a violation of the primary key if you open your table and open your customer table from The Columns you will see that ID has this kind of key sign it means that it is a primary key as you can see it says PK here also if you open your keys there we you will see this primary key on one table you can have only one primary key and it will not allow null values remember this so what if I want to insert another row it is very simple just use another number for example two and it will be inserted out let's select from it select from this customer table and we have this kind of information also there is another way for example when we are using primary key we want SQL Server to out automatically give my ID value for example instead of me writing 1 two three and so on let esol server decide what to insert for example let's create another customers table for example customers table two here if you include identity identity and if you include this numbers for example one comma 1 this means that SQL Server will start counting from one and will add up one every time new row gets inserted you can start from anywhere for example from 100 from 1,000 or even from 10,000 so for now let's start from one create this table let's copy paste this in insert statement we want customers table to and now we should not include this ID column let SQL Server decide from where to start actually it to start from one as we said right again let's insert one time two times three times four times and let's select our data select start from our customer to table and as you saw our ID got generated automatically so how to check if your table has a primary key or have identity insert turned on there is multiple ways but one of the best way is to just open your columns you will see this sign and PK it means that it has a primary key and if you want to see that if identity is turned on go on and open your customer table go to design click on the column and down here you will see identity specific specification for now it says yes it's starting from one and identity seed is one if you open just your customer table this option will be disabled and here instead of saying yes it will say no from here you will be able to also turn it on so this is for primary key let's move on to the foring key so why do we have foring keys foring keys are used to connect multiple tables to each other with primary key for example let's use this second table this customers to table and let's create another table where for example create table and call it orders for example these customers can order different things from our store orders let's give this orders table their column for example order ID it is important to keep track of our orders with order IDs again in primary key and let's turn on this identity insert on once again but let's start counting from 100 instead of one and increment by one again let's see what customer ordered for example let's say order name make it warar okay let's say 16 and also in my order table I want to include my customer's ID so how should I do it so that is where our foreign key comes in for example you can create here customers customer ID which is in and which is foring key and it should reference to some table right to my customers to table and it should use by the reference my ID from my customer table I want to use my ID column so my I have new column here customer ID which is int which is foring key and it should reference to my ID column so this is how we use these foring keys so again let's create this second table once again for demonstration let's select data from our customers to table and we have four columns right now let's insert something in our order table let's say values and as for values we do not need to include order ID it will start from 100 but we need to include for example order name let's say gaming PC right but also we need to now include our customer ID in our table we have customer ID 1 2 three and four let's include one let's create another insert statement another and another instead of gaming PC let's let's write Mouse here for example RAM for example CPU right and instead of one let's use two let's use three let's use four and let's run this command and let's now select from my order table let's copy this select also this first table is my customer table and this second table is my order table so as we can see our first customer ordered gaming PC which order ID is 100 my second customer ordered Mouse and so on so what if I try to insert something in my orders table for example this four is my customer ID right if I try to insert for example here 10 it will say that inster statement conflicted with foreign key what it means it means that in our customer table which my orders table is referencing by this column and by this column I do not have this ID 10 so my orders table doesn't know customer whose ID is 10 but if I add this ID 10 in my for example in my customers two table values for example let's say name last name I need to run this six times to get an ID of 10 right we have because we have identity insert on let's say 1 2 3 4 5 six and we have ID 10 and if I run this command again everything will be okay so I'm using this for in key to make sure that someone will not make some kind of mistake during inserting orders for example if I do not have customer how they they can can have some kind of order right this is for the foreign Keys you can have multiple foreign keys in your table from different tables so now let's move on to our unique key unique key again ensur that a column has a unique value but unlike a primary key it can have null value let's create another table for example let's create some kind of test one one table and let's create different columns for example column one which is in let's say primary key let's say column two again in but let's give it like unique let's make it unique and also let's create another column column three again in and unic so I can have multiple unique keys in my table but I cannot have multiple primary Keys also my primary key does not allow null values while unique key allows but it only allows one null value in my table for example if I create this table oh I forgot to write here table let's run it once more and let's insert something into my test one table and values for example one two again let's say one one one right it will allow me to do it but if I try to insert for example primary key is correct but my unit key will be incorrect as you can see violation of the unique key it acted as a primary key same way as a primary key acts and it will not allow me to insert duplicate values since I already have this van value here so what if I try to insert something for example let's change this to three Al this d three what if I try to insert n in my primary key so this First Column is primary key and let's try cannot insert values null into column one because this column one is a primary key but but what if I try to insert null value here this is my unique key so it will actually do it but it will actually do it only one time if I try it second time for example let's change these numbers as you can see again violation of the unique key because every Row in this column should be different so I inserted null value once that's it I will not be able to do it again this is it for like this video in this video we explained main concepts of table like what is a row what is a column what is a primary key what is a foreign key and what is a unique key this primary key unique key and foreign key is very important to understand so make sure that you watch this video very carefully and make sure that you will do all these tests in your computer to understand these Concepts more again thanks for watching if you like this video make sure to subscribe see you next time

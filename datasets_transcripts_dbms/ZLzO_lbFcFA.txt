so what have we not done already in first normal form and second normal form that we will be doing in third normal form watch the complete video to understand the concept yes so we are going to simplify the concept of third normal form hello and welcome everyone to my channel making it simple previously I have explained normalization first normal form and second normal form and next we have third normal form third step in normalization process in first normal form we got rid of composite and multi-valued attributes in second normal form we got rid of partial dependency so now let us see what we will be eliminating in third normal form so without wasting any time let us start after a short intro so as there are two conditions for first normal form and second normal form similarly there are two conditions for third normal form as well first condition is that the table or relation must be in second normal form and the second condition is that there must not be any transitive dependency present in the relation or table if any table satisfies these two conditions then we can say that the table or relation is in third normal form let us understand both these conditions one by one so the first condition is table or relation must be in second normal form let us take an example look at this following table let us identify if the table is in second normal form it does not have any composite attributes it also does not have any multi-valued attributes following are the functional dependencies for this relation based on this functional dependencies we can conclude that there is no partial dependency present in this relation or table if you want to know how to verify if there is a partial dependency present in a table or not watch my video on it links in the description so coming back to the point these two conditions mean that the table is in first normal form and it is in first normal form and has no partial dependency present in it these two conditions mean that the table is in second normal form so this table satisfies the first condition for the table to be in third normal form second condition for third normal form is there must not be any transitive dependency present in it I have a video on transitive dependency too check it out for in-depth concept but for now let's recall what transitive dependency is if a prime attribute a identifies non-prime attribute B and non-prime attribute B identifies non-prime attribute C then a indirectly identifies C this dependency where a non-prime attribute determines another non-prime attribute is said to be transitive dependency so let us understand with an example this table is in second normal form now let us check if this table satisfies transitive dependency condition in this table employee ID is the prime attribute and following are the functional dependencies for this table first one is employee ID determines employee name and project ID and the second one is Project ID determines project name so employee ID determines project ID and project ID determines project name so indirectly employee ID determines project name here in this transitive dependency a non-prime attribute project ID determines another non-prime attribute project name so in this table transitive dependency exists so this table is not in third normal form now let us see how can we convert this table into third normal form by eliminating transitive dependency to do so we simply need to break down the table in two different tables we will create a table project where project ID is primary key and project name is another column and in another table we have employee ID which is primary key employee name and project ID will be foreign key in this table by doing this transitive dependency project ID determines project name has been eliminated so why exactly do we need third normal form so as we saw that even after the table being in second normal form the redundancy is still present in the table we remove the partial dependency during Second normal form but still if there is transitive dependency there will be redundancy present in the table this redundancy in large database can take up huge space but after converting the table into third normal form redundancy has been eliminated from it so you must have understood third normal form concept if the table does not have transitive dependency and the table is in second normal form then we can say that the table is in third normal form in further video we will cover bcnf or voice code normal form so stay tuned if you found this video helpful like the video and share the video with someone who needs help and also subscribe my channel making ID simple and click on the Bell icon to get notified whenever I upload a new video see you in the next video thank you

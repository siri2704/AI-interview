in this session we are discussing ear diagrams and different symbols used in that so there are so many symbols are there which can be used in at ear diagram we shall go one by one through this particular diagrams see the first one is the entity set which will be denoted by one rectangle and the entity will be written within that particular rectangle so this is a rectangle and the entity name will be written within the rectangle feels weak entity set weak entity set don't have any kind of primary key it does not have any primary key it is having a partial key we shall have a separate video where we shall discuss we can detect more into details relationship set will be denoted by diamond and the relationship set name will be written inside I didn't define the relationship will be denoted by this double the amount and this identifying relationship name will be retained inside in case of primary key we know that attribute will be enclosed within ellipse and in case of primary key it will be having underlined so a attribute name and it will be underlined in case of many-to-many relationship there will be no arrow across this edges so in case of many-to-many relationship there will be no arrow across this edges in case of one-to-one relationship there will be arrows on both directions as it has been shown in case of many to one relationship that will be arrow from many to one so obviously in case of one-to-many relationship this arrow will not be here but that that will be one arrow here so always remember from many to one the ad will be directed so we have discussed this one next one is the role indicator the role indicator will be shown in this way so this is my relationship set this is my entity set and the role name will be written across the link or line attribute will be denoted in this way multivalued tribute will be denoted by double ellipse derive attribute whose value will be calculated by some calculations by some business rule will be enclosed within - ellipse total participation of entity set in the relationship will be denoted by double lines in between the relationship and the entity discriminating attribute of weekend in the set that is the partial K will be denoted by a with the dashed underlined many-to-one relationship we have discussed earlier cardinality limits will be denoted in this way here it has been written as 1 dot dot H that means each and every entity the respective primary key value can exist here for minimum one time and for maximum H number of times so that is our 1 dot dot H this is a this is a case where you will be going for generalization and specialization and it will be denoted by is a so that will be one triangle within that is a will be written we shall have a separate video on this very particular topic discussion you can go through that video to have a better conception so these are the very common symbols which will be used in our diagram design I think you are getting this issue thanks for watching this video

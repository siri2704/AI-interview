welcome back I hope you are doing great as a part of this video we'll understand why do we really need Data before we really get into why do we need data do we need data can you think for a second yes our Ponda says yes and obviously you are also saying yes we do need data but why do we need data we need data to use it in the future isn't it obvious we'll come to that we need data to derive insights we need data to derive patterns as you know data is valuable only if we can translate the data into insights so what do insight to by the Insight we'll understand what is valuable in our data otherwise the data is mere data without deriving the insets will not be able to make any business decisions for example here there is a chart of what kind of goods or services have been bought on the Internet or the last year with this we'll get a wonderful insights of what kind of goods are being sold over the Internet cloths being the highest in that particular year right so that way we'll get an Insight from analyzing the data we need data to derive insights we do need data to derive patterns we can find patterns in the data like numbers trending upwards we can also find out correlations between the set of numbers how one set of numbers are correlating with the another set of numbers and as you discussed obviously we need the data to future use like research and development if you want to provide a greater personalization of our product we would need the data and also we can identify New Opportunities by analyzing the data and we definitely can use the data for betterment of Technologies wonderful thank you [Music]

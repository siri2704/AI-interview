welcome back I hope you're doing great as a part of this video we'll understand some of the systems which can store the data in the previous video we understood different ways of storing the data like list and we can store the data in hierarchy and we can store the data in table as well but we understood the ways of storing the data we do need a system to store the data right or somewhere we need to store the data just by mere understanding the ways of storing the data we will not be able to store the data we need to understand where we can store the data where so if I take you back to early days of modern computers what are the systems in which we stored the data any thought first thing it comes to your mind is text files in the early days of modern computers we started storing the data in text files moving further did we always store the data in text files the obvious answer is no we did store the data in Excel files or spreadsheets but why did we store the data in spreadsheets are Excel sheets because storing and retrieving the data text files was difficult that is when they shifted to excel sheets or spreadsheet because it is easy to store and retrieve the data here if I ask you a question did we continue to store the data in only spreadsheets not really that is where we started storing the data in some of the semi structured files like Json and XML filed continuing the same question further did we always store the data in semi-structured files like xmls and Json or is there any other way of storing and processing the data that is where comes the rdbms systems thanks to Edgar fard who is the Pioneer who introduced us to rdbm systems we'll understand the contributions of Edgar fard in the next video thank you [Music]

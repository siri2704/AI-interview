in this video we are going to discuss about data models in dbms data models are mainly useful in order to design a database so to design the database we use this uh data model the best example for the data model is if you take the example of construction of a house so first we have to design the plan so that plan is called as blueprint that plan is called as blueprint so first we have to design the blueprint next according to the blueprint the builder will build the house so that is nothing but what is data model so data model will gives a complete idea about how the final system will look likes after its implementation okay so before actually implementing the project or before actually implementing the database first we have to design the database and after that it should be implemented so we have different types of data models such as hierarchical data model so first one is hierarchical data model second one is network data model network data model third one is entity relationship model entity relationship model fourth one is relational model relational model fifth one is object-based data model object basically data model which can also be called as object-oriented data model and the last one is semi-structured data model semi-structured data model so hierarchical data model network data model entity relationship model relational model object-based data model semi-structured data model so in this video we are going to discuss about all these data models so first let us see about the first one the first one is hierarchical data model so hierarchical means uh it is mainly useful in order to store the information level by level so grand parent level parent level chain level so it simply forms a tree structure we know what is a tree in a tree that atmos node is called as root node so root node contains some children's so again those children's contain children's so likewise the process will continues so this is diagram here so this is the root node so root node children's let here we have a record one stored next record two e stored next record one children's are record three record four next record two children's are record five record six record seven likewise so if you want to store the information level by level so this is level zero so this is level zero level zero is nothing but grand parent level this is level one so level 1 means parent level level 2 children level so likewise we can store the information in n number of levels so hierarchical means pre-structured information so in the golden days hierarchical data model is used now let us see the here hierarchical data model mainly forms uh one too many relationships so it mainly forms one too many relationship so one too many relationship means each node will have only one parent node and it can have many number of children if we consider record one record one has only one parent that is root and it has two children if we consider r2 recorder 2 so r2 has only one parent and it has three children's so it mainly forms one too many relationship now let us see the second type of data model the second type of data model is network data model so what is the second one the second one is network data model so hierarchical data model means uh it follows tree structure various network data model means it follows graph structure okay so let this is the root node and next we have one more node like this so let us record one let it be recorded to let it be recorded three let it be record four let it be record five let it be record six the card six okay so if we consider record three okay record three has two parents they are r1 and r2 the card three has two childhoods they are r5 and r6 so network data model means it follows many too many relationship so many too many relationship so many too many relationship means each node can have many parents and many number of children okay so r3 has two parents as well as it has two children so in the olden days we use this network data model network data model is an extension to the hierarchical data model uh nowadays we are not using hierarchical and network data model now here is we are using relational data model now let us see the third one so the third one is uh entity relationship model entity relationship model so this can also be called as in charter we can call it as er model er model so er model mainly contains three things so the first one is entity the second one is attribute attributes third one is relationship relationship so here model mainly comprises these three things so first one is entity what is entity entity means any real world entity any real-world thing so anything that has physical existence is called as entity so student is identity because student has some physical existence so faculty is identity duster is an entity this body is an entity this marker pen is an entity so anything that has some physical existence is called as entity next what is attribute attributes are nothing but the properties of the entity if you take student so student have roll number student help name student help mocks so rule number name box or nothing but the attributes of student entity okay so properties of the entity are called as attributes if you take employee employee number name and salary so those three are the attributes of the employee entity next one is relationship relationship is mainly useful in order to connect two entities in order to join two entities let us take an example of the er diagram uh let here we have two entities uh let the first entity is student so entity is represented by rectangle symbol okay let the second entity is course let the second entity is scores so course is an entity so that's why it is represented by rectangle symbol next attributes are represented by ellipse or mobile symbol okay so what are the attributes of the student so student will have role number so this is mobile symbol student we have some name our next student we have some course id so here course id means the course which which is to be uh study by the corresponding student okay so that course id okay uh next a course so course we have course id next course we have course name so next these are nothing but links so links are useful in order to join entities attributes and relationship so what is the relationship between student and course student and role for the course so here the relationship is represented by ramba symbol diamond symbol here the relationship is enrolled so student enrolled for the course so this is nothing but re-enrolled is nothing but relationship between the student entity and the course entity so in this way we can represent an er model now let us see the next one the next one is relational model fourth one is uh relational model so now here is uh we are using relational model only so rdbms relational database management system relational model so relational model is the popular data model uh the best examples for the relational model are microsoft sql server next we have mysql next to db2 so these are the best examples for the relational model so relational model here the in relational model we use as relations in relational model relations are called as tables relations are called as tables we know what is a table table means it contains a collection of rows and columns table is a collection of rows and columns let me have a table like this let the first column is roll number and let the second column here is uh name name let the third column is is let the next column is box let roll number is one name is some brahmo ace is 19 mark some 90 so 2 20 85 so three uh ramesh 21 let the percentage that the box is 95 so this entire table is called as relation so this table is called as student relation okay and next year each row of your table is called as tuple so tuple means rows of your table this can also be called as record so this is one to pull this is second tuple this is star triple so tuple means row next the particular value is called yes attribute so attribute attribute is nothing but the values so roll number is an attribute one is an attribute two is an attribute three is an attribute name is an attribute ramu is an attribute likewise so this is about uh what is relational model so in relational model mainly we use just the terminologies such as tables that is relational next attributes and tuples okay now let us see the next model the next model is objective basic model object based reported or we can call this as object-oriented data model object-based data model or we can call as object-oriented data model so here object we know what is an object object means any real-world entity anything that has physical existence here the object contains data methods and relations so object contains let this is object one let this is objective so every object will have data as well as methods so methods are useful in order to perform operations on the data okay so every object we have data and methods if the let the first object is student object so what is the data of the student object student will have some rule number student will have some name student will have some course id so the courses which are studied by the student next methods so what are the operations which we can perform on the student one student can get the mocks and student can get the attendance so methods are nothing but the operations which are to be performed on the corresponding object let the second object is codes so course we have course id our next course we have course name course name next here we can perform so many operations we can get the marks of a particular student by using get marks method we can add the mocks for a particular students using the admocks method here in order to establish the relationships we have to use the common attribute if we consider these two objects here the common attribute is course id so by using this course id the relationship is to be established between the objects here one object communicates with another object with the help of this common attribute okay so here everything is data information data methods and everything is available in object only and all the objects are communicated with each other and they will pass their messages corresponding messages so this is about object-based data model and last one is semi-structured data model and the last one is semi-structured data model semi-structured data model here semi-structured data model means some entities some entities may have some missing attributes may have some missing attributes and some entities may have additional attributes some entities may have some additional additional attributes so we can remove the corresponding additional attributes or we can add the attributes with the help of the xml technology so here we uses xml technologies in order to add additional attributes or in order to remove uh the attributes which are not needed okay so xml stands for extensible markup language but the major advantage of the xml is here we can create our own tag elements and we can provide the information as well as if you want we can remove the information so this is about data models in dbms so this is about data models in dbms

normalization is a way of uh organizing the database in such a way that it will help to uh reduce the redundancy and dependency in our table so we use uh to organize data efficiently so let's first understand there are the various of normal forms of the normalization first is the first normal form so in the first first normal form um there are some rules first is the that all the row should be unique and uh all the C should contain a single value suppose I have a table of student which contain the column like student ID name and subject so the problem is the subject column has the multiple values like maths physics which is not automic so what we'll do will create a table uh same uh table just the subject which contain the multiple values will create the more uh one more uh Row for that uh subject so now each value is atomic second is the second normal form is 2 NF the rules are first the table should be in the first NF and second is there is no partial dependency now what is partial dependency every non key column must depend on the whole primary key not just a part of it uh like I have a table as a student table which contain the columns like student ID course ID student name and course name so the problem is the student name depend on the student ID right and course name is depend on the course Ting so we can convert and transform into the 2 NF while uh we will create the three table student table which contain the student ID and uh name second course table which will be having the course ID and course name and third table is enrollment table which will be having the student ID and course ID now all the non key column are depend on the whole primary key this is how we convert into the 2nf third will be the third normal form uh which is 3nf and the rules are like uh first the table should be in the 2nf and second is there is no transitive dependen means that the non key column should not depend on the other non key columns so if I have the tables of employee which have the columns like employee ID employee name Department ID and Department name now the problem is Department name depend on the department ID and employee ID so we can create the two tables to convert into the three NF first employee table and second is a department table so the employee table will contain the column like employee ID employee name and Department ID and Department table contain Department ID and Department name so now no non key column depend on the another non key column right and fourth will be the uh boys called normal form uh which is also called as bcnf and it is stronger than 3nf the rules are like the TBL should be in the 3nf and every determinant must be a candidate key mean a determinant is any column that uniquely identify another column uh if I have a table as of the teacher which contain the column teacher ID subject and department so each subject so the problem is like each subject uniquely determine the department and subject but uh subject is not a candidate key right so we will fix this into the BNF like uh we'll be having the two tables subject table and teacher table so subject table will contain the subject and department and the teacher table will have the teacher ID and subject now all determinants are candidate key so we'll be having the quick recap as one andf uh which contain the all the rows should be unique and it should contain the single value in 2 NF there is no partially dependency means every column depend on the whole primary key in 3 NF no transitive dependency will be there non key columns means non key column are depend only on the primary key and in the BNF every determinant must be a candidate key

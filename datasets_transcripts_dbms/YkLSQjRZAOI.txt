hello and welcome to today in tech i'm michael trageser and this is the first screencast with a series of screencasts that i will be doing uh in correspondence with my ist 210 class here at penn state uh just kind of starting off a little bit about me i'm a sophomore here at penn state i study industrial engineering from pittsburgh pennsylvania 25 minutes north of pittsburgh pennsylvania um i know that being an ist class of course ist 210 it's kind of unconventional for an engineer to take a class like this um you know a lot of my studies have been kind of based on physics and math and chemistry and stuff like that so it's a little bit different but i think i think it can provide a great value to me as i move forward with my academic career and it's something i'm really excited about i'm talking about this channel here today in tech it's kind of going to be a weekly weekly posting of different topics within technology and um kind of learning what i use in the classroom and then kind of sharing it out here with the world so i'll get into content later in this video but looking at the future um i think it's this is a great way for me to try and build uh my resume as an engineer trying to make myself more well well-rounded and uh communicate with a vast array groups of people that i think could be very beneficial for me so today's topic that we're going to be talking about is dealing with sql and nosql so if you're like me and coming into this whenever i was giving this assignment i had i wasn't really sure what either of these things were so you know did some digging and tried to learn as best i could get up to speed with with these different uh these different topics within the world of technology sql uh sorry then we're also so not only talking about what they are trying to define them and then also talking about functionality and then some you know advantages that uh each bring to the table and some differences along the way so looking at sql here you sql is basically if i can move my screen to this sql is basically a it's kind of like a middleman between a database and then the user of the database it allows you to to look up specific pieces of information within a database it's primarily used as you can see here you know editing databases and stuff like that it makes it really easy to do that sql language stands for as you can see your structure query language it's also called sql in the world of technology quite often it originated uh back around during the 1970s made it a lot easier for people to access big you know groups and uh big boxes of data so as you can see here sql it's formatted in tables um this this allows you to kind of um work within table to table trying to look at uh relationships uh for pieces of data um it's kind of like a standard data sheet where you can see here there's uh there's columns and rows pertaining to specific pieces of data um nosql is a little bit different um nosql is not a language it's actually a database itself it's it's newer it originates you know late 2000's is when nosql really came out and there's as you can see here there's some differing um differing types of nosql databases first one here outlined is document databases that's the one i'm kind of going to hone in on today and try and get some explanation there there's also key value databases wide column and graph databases all within nosql so looking at document databases as you can see here a little bit different than standard sql because for a document database all the data is stored within this document and then let's say that you have a user who who needs to see this specific topic no sql would be useful there because you're able to kind of assign data to these documents and then branch out within that as you can see here so a user might give be given access to uh one document then within that there's other uh documents that they can then you look at as that user uh based on what they need applications for and then within these documents you can see others there's book collections down here so just subcategories within nosql databases make it very easy for the user to kind of see all the data that they need and better help their needs as

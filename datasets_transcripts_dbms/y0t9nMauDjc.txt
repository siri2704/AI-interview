now let us discuss about functional dependency in dbms we know that a table is a collection of attributes if you take this table this table contains three attributes such as roll number name and quotes functional dependency the name itself specifies the meaning one or more attributes of your relation depends upon one or more attributes of the same relation here the relation and the table both are same only so one or more attributes of the table depends on one or more attributes of the same table okay a functional dependency is denoted by yarrow this is we can call this as determines on the left hand side let me have a on right hand side we have B so we can call this as a determines B a determines B or this can also be called as or this can also be called as B dependent on a be dependent on a so here water A and B A and B are nothing but one or more attributes uh here uh a is called yes we can call a as determinant determinate whereas we can call B as dependent we can call B as dependent why because a determines B so that's why it is called as determinant whereas B depends upon a so that's why it is called as determinant here we can say that ah a determines B if each value of a determines exactly one value of B we can say that a determines B if each value of a determines exactly one value of B so that means if we take two tuples if we take two tuples then if T1 T1 is nothing but first Apple tapul is nothing but a row if T1 dot a a is nothing but the attribute if T1 dot a is equal to T2 dot a then T1 dot b must also be equals to T2 dot b okay uh let us take an example here uh here uh let us before that let us take an example here ah let me have a table which contains only two attributes A and B I'll let the values of a are 10 20 30 whereas the values of B are one two three one two three if a value is 10 then we can say that b value is 1 that means a determines B if we know the value of a then we can determine the value of B also if a is 30 then we can say that the B value is 3 okay let me have another row like this so 10 1 10 1 here if you see here if T1 dot a is equal to T2 dot a let us observe these two rows here what is first suitable this is the first Apple this is the second Tuple okay what is T1 dot a 10 what is T2 dot a 10 then T1 dot b should also equals to T2 dot b what is T1 dot b 1 what is T2 dot b one so now we can say that a functionally dependent a determines B that means B functionally dependent on a let us assume that in initiative of 1 we have 4 here we have 4 here if we observe these two tuples what is C1 dot a 10 what is T2 dot a 10 10 double equal to 10 then T1 dot b should also equals to T2 dot b but what is T1 dot b one what is T2 dot b four one equal to 4 so that is false so we can say that a implies B A determines B this is false this is false okay B doesn't functionally dependent on a b doesn't depends upon a okay now let's see this example we have a table like this uh now here our aim is we have to check whether these four functional dependencies are correct or wrong okay the first two functional dependency is roll number determines name rule number determines name so if we observe any two tuples ah yeah we need to search for all the tuples let us take these two tuples why because here in these two tuples what is T one dot a 72 what is T1 dot rule number 72 what is T 2.2 number 72 then T1 dot name should also equals to T2 dot name what is C1 dot name Ramesh what is T2 dot name Ramesh so they are same so we can if we observe the remaining rows there is no duplicacy so here when we have to search for this condition if T1 dot rule number equals to T2 dot rule number only let us assume that if we consider these two rows here T 1.2 number is 72 T2 dot rule number is 73 so 72 equal to 73 false so there is no need to check for T1 dot name on T2 dot name so let us focus on 7274 T1 dot row number 72 t2.2 number 74 these two are not equal so there is no need to check for that one so we can say that the first functional dependency is correct only now let's check for the second one roll number implies course so here this is the rule number attribute this is the course attribute uh let's check for the same values okay here T1 dot rule number is 72 what is T2 dot rule number 72 let us focus on these two tuples these two rows why because here the rule number is same okay then T1 dot course should also equals to 2 do that course but what is the one dot course python what is T2 dot course Java so python Java they are not equal they are different so we can say that this functional dependency is wrong let us see the next one uh course determines name course determines name uh now we have to consider these two tuples these two tuples these two rows why because here the course is same course is same uh what is C1 dot course python what is T what is T2 dot course python If You observe this one what is T1 dot uh name what is T1 dot name Ramesh what is T2 dot name Mahesh so Ramesh Mahesh they are not equal so we can say that this functional dependency is also wrong so here in the left hand side we can have more attributes in the right hand side also we can have more attributes we can write according to our comfortability okay here I am taking two attribute in the left hand side rule number name ah this is the first attribute set second one is course if you consider rule number and name rule number and name roll number name let us consider these these two rows uh why because in the first row what is row number 72 what is name Ramesh if you consider the second row 72 what is the name Mahesh but what is C1 dot course python what is T2 dot codes Java so T1 dot uh course is not equals to T2 dot codes so we can say that this functional dependency is wrong okay why because here the courses are different in place of java if we have python then we can say that those two are equal so this functional dependency will be correct only so this is about what is functional dependency in dbms in the next video we will see different types of functional dependency

hello to my all friends welcome back to the new video where I'm going to discuss a nosql research paper where we're going to see the SQL versus nosql for The Internet of Things databases so Internet of Things uh is provides an environment where many devices come together and interact with each other where they share and uh gather information and to ma but to manage those vast informations we definitely need a database to store where a traditional SQL database which is reliable but faces limitations in handling the complexity and the scale of uh Internet of Things data so this presentation explores the advantages and disadvantages of the SQL and nosql databases for The Internet of Things applications providing the insights on their suitability for different scenarios let's begin seeing the comparative analysis of the SQL versus nosql for Internet of Things First first thing we encounter is the capap theorem capap theorem cap theorem this states that the distributed databased system can only satisfy two out of three properties that is consistency availability and partition tolerance the SQL databas is prioritize consistency ensuring the Integrity even when the network fails then noq database prioritizes availability all access to data even if some notes are unavailable coming on to the AET property which is elaborated as atomicity consistency and uh the durability the SEL databases are there to the asset property and uh these properties ensure that transactions are are executed reliably and data remains consistent no SQL databases on the other hand often relax these properties to achieve higher availability and scalability the base properties which are followed by nosql that is basic availability soft State and eventual consistency these properties prioritize availability and allow for temporary inconsistencies which are eventually resolved this approach is suitable for applications where data consistency is not critical the characteristics for iot applications that are mainly scalability data retrieval speed system maturity and security the scalability is very crucial for iot applications as the volume of the data generated by connecting many devices as I discussed can grow exponentially which is hard to maintain so the SQL databases typically scale vertically adding more resources to a single server no SQL databases on the other hand often scale horizontally Distributing data across multiple servers the data retrieval speed which is very important factor where the efficient data retrieval is essential for realtime analysis to make decision in iot applications the skq databases excel in complex queries using join statements but can be slower for large data sets no SQL databases with their objectoriented data models often offer faster retrieval for specific data points the system maturity and security SQL databases have a long history and established security features making them a reliable choice for critical applications no skill databases are relatively newer and their security features are still evolving however the offer flexibility and scalability that can be advantages for rapidly growing G iot deployments now we see the case study of a water sprinkler system which is mainly divided into four stages the first one is sensor data collection where the temperature humidity and soil moisture sensors gather real time data from the environment in the data transmission stage trans uh sensors transmit collected data to a central database server for analysis and proessing the third stage of it is database storage and Analysis where the database server stores and analyzes The Collector data to determine the optimal watering schedules and the trigger sprinkler activation which will in fact save the water and can be used as the resources efficiently the sprinkler activation is done based on the analysis where the sprinklers are activated to provide appropriate watering on the environmental conditions the experimental setup and tools are ardino Uno board that is used for collecting sensor data from environment myql database that was used used for storing and analyzing sensor data mongod DB database used for storing and analyzing sensor data providing a nosql alternative to mySQL then the Pache which is used for performance testing and analyzing the response times of both data sets databases the results gathered from experiment in the select queries with the response time versus number of thread the experiment measured response time of Select queries for both myql and mongodb databases wearing the number of threads concurrently accessing the database the results showed the mongod DV consistently outperformed myql in terms of response time especially as the number of threats increased response time versus number of Records the experiment also analyzed the response time of the select queries as the number of Records in the database increased mongodb demonstrated better scalability maintaining faster response times even with a larger data set this highlights the efficiency of mongodb's data retrieval mechanism for handling large volumes of Internet of Things data the experimental results on insert queries the experiment measured response time of insert queries for both the myql and mongodb databases wearing the number of threats concurrently accessing the database mongod D consistently about performed myql in terms of response time specially as the number of threats increased response time versus number of Records the experiment also analyzed the response time of insert queries as the number of Records in database increased mongodb demonstrated better scalability maintaining faster response time even with the larger data set that highlights the efficiency of mongod data retrieval mechanism for handling large volume of iot data the conclusion and the future developments the comparative results are the experiment demonstrated no SQL databases like mongodb offer significant performance advantages over SQL databases like MySQL in handling large volumes of data and high concurrency in iot applications the database selection recommendation for iot applications requiring High scalability availability and fast data retrieval no SQL databases are a suitable choice however for applications demanding strict data consistency and complex queries SQL databases remain a reliable option future research directions are further the research can explore the hybrid database approaches that combine the strength of both SQL and nosql databases leveraging The Best of Both Worlds for Optimal Performance and data management in iot environments by this we come to the end of the video thank you for being with me land hope you have a good day

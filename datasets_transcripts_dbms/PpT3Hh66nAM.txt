in this video we are going to discuss about ER model ER model stands for entity relationship model uh we are going to discuss all these Concepts uh introduction to the ER model next what is entity what is attribute what is entity set types of attributes relationship relationship set degree of relationship mapping cordal or cordal ratio and the last concept is participation constraints so first let us see introduction to the ER model what is the purpose of er model ER model is mainly useful for Designing the database designing the database we know that we have three levels of abstraction are there physical level next one is conceptual or logical level conceptual or logical level and the third level is view level or external level ER model is useful for conceptual or logical level of the database we know the advantage of con conceptual or logical level it is mainly useful in order to describe the structure of the database so er model is also useful in order to describe structure of the database in order to describe structure of the database the best example here is uh if you take the example of construction of house before constructing any house first we have to design the plan that plan is called as blueprint now according to the blueprint the Builder will build the house likewise before implementing the database first we have to design the database so that database design is done by using the entity relationship model ER model is nothing but but a graphical representation a pictorial representation ER model is a graphical representation of entities entities and relationships so here we have two terms are there entity relationship so e model is nothing but a graphical or pictorial representation of entities and the relationship among the entities so this is about introduction to the E model what is e model what is the purpose of e model now let us see the next concept so what is the next concept so here introduction is over the next concept is entity so what is entity entity is a thing a thing or object that is distinguishable that is distinguishable that is distinguishable from other objects from other objects so entity is anything or it may be an object so we can uh distinguish here an object from the other object the best examples for the entities are a person a student a student is an entity faculty is an entity student or student entity is distinguishable from faculty entity next a course is an entity a classroom is an entity here entity means it may be a physical thing or logical thing if you take student faculty classroom these three are physically exist whereas if you take course course is not physically exist so entity means it may be a physical or logical thing also okay so this is about the definition for the entity now let us see what is attribute what is attribute so attribute means we can describe entities describe entities using properties so those properties are called as attributes so in order to provide more information about the entities so we have to use what properties so attributes are useful for describing the attributes attributes are useful for describing the entities by using with the properties so here attributes are nothing but properties of the entity properties of the entity if you take student entity so then the attributes are SCH number name Mars yes if you take employee entity then attributes are employee number employee name salary if you take course entity then the attributes are course ID course name and duration of the course so attribute means in order to describe the entity we uses the attributes okay so describing entities using the properties so that is nothing but what is attribute now let us see what is entity set what is entity set entity we know what is a set set means collection so entity set can also be called as entity type also entity type also entity set means a set of entities having say properties having same properties a collection of entities having same properties if you take student entity set student entity set it is a collection of it is a collection of student entities it is a collection of student entities why because all the students shares the same attributes the same properties likewise we can take employee entity set what is employee entity set it is a collection of employee entities why because all the employees will share the same attributes all the employees will shares the same properties so that is about what is entity set entity set means collection of entities of the same type so faculty entity set so faculty entity set contains a collection of Faculty entities why because all the faculty entities shares the same properties okay so this is about what is entity what is attribute and then what is entity set okay now let us see about types of attributes types of attributes so the next concept is types of attributes so what is attribute so attribute is nothing but properties of the entities so here we have to enter some value let it be some name so here the values that we enter in the attribute is called as domain domain so what is domain domain means values of the attribute the permitted values of the attribute is called as domain or range so what is domain or range the permitted values of the attribute if you take yes so for yes what is the permitted value y means it may it is a number it is a number but it should not be a negative number it should be a positive number from from 1 to 100 okay likewise if you take a name name means it contains some character it should not have any special symbols it should not have any digits so that is called as domain or range here mainly we have three types of attributes are there the first one is the first one is simple and composite attribute so the first attribute is simple attribute and composite attribute composite attribute the second attribute is single valued single valued attribute and multivalued attribute single valued attribute and multivalued attribute third one is stored attribute stored attribute and derived attribute derived attribute so mainly we have these six types of attributes are there so first one is simple attribute so what is simple attribute simple attribute means the attribute values are Atomic so what is atomic Atomic means those values cannot be divided further if the best example here is mobile number if you take mobile number mobile number contains 10 digits we can't divide 10 digits into two parts likewise if you take registration number rule number we can't divide rule number into into two parts okay so that is about simple attribute simple attribute means the attribute values must be Atomic so which can't be divided further now let us see what is composite attribute composite attribute is made up of a collection of simple attributes the best example for the composite attribute is uh name if we take name we will have several simple attributes such as as first we need to write first name next middle name last name here first name is nothing but middle attribute first name is nothing but simple attribute middle name is nothing but simple attribute last name is nothing but a simple attribute likewise if you take address address is also made up of several simple attributes first we have to specify door number that is one simple attribute next we have to specify Street line number next we have to specify Colony next we have to specify nearby location next if it is Village then Village Mand District next state next country so we have to specify several simple attributes okay and the next one is single valued attribute single valued attribute means the attribute value must be single the attribute value must be single so here the best example is par number number a person can have only one PA number likewise other number a person will have only one other number a person can't have more than one other number okay so this is single value attribute whereas multivalued attribute means here attribute value may contain multiple values the best example is email address a person may have multiple email address and the next one is mobile number a person may have multiple mobile numbers so that is about multi valued attribute and the next one is stored attribute stored attribute means the attributes which are stored physically in the database here all these are stored attribute only mobile number Register number name address SP number a number all these are nothing but stored attributes these attributes are physically stored in the database various derived attribute means these attributes are not stored physically in the database the name itself specifies the meaning derived attribute means the attributes which are derived from some other attributes of the database so derived attribute means we have to derive these attributes from other attributes of the database the best example for the derived attribute is a generally a will not be stored in the database a is derived from date of birth so generally we will enter date of birth so depends upon the date of birth age will be calculated so we can say that age is derived attribute and the next one is average salary of the department generally average salary will not be stored physically in the database average salary will be calculated depends upon the total that formula total number of that total salary by number of employees So based on that formula average salary will be calculated so this is about types of attributes so with this we discussed about entities as well as attributes in the examination if the question is given on explain entities then this explanation is enough of two types of attributes and we have to and you need to draw one diagram for the ER model okay and the remaining Concepts on relationship so first let us see what is relationship so relationship mainly specifies associations among the entities associations among entities associations among entities that means how one entity is associated I ated with another entity association means related connected how one entity is related with another entity how one entity is connected with another entity let we have two entities let the first entity is student entity here entities are represented by this rectangle symbol okay this rectangle symbol varas attributes are represented by ellip symbol so what are the attributes of the student rule number so attributes are nothing but we have to represent them in ellipse symbol okay ellipse whereas entity means rectangle symbol let the second entity is course so student enrolled in course here student is one entity course is another entity what are the attributes of the course course will have course ID course will have course name next the relationship between these two entities is nothing but enrolled student enrolled in the course enrolled relationship is represented by diamond symbol rambus symbol okay so enrolled is the relationship between the student entity and course entity so this is the simple diagram for the ER model so here the relationship specifies associations relations between two entities how student entities Rel ated with course entity okay so this is about what is a relationship now let us see what is relationship set relationship set already we discussed about entity set what is entity set set of entities collection of entities likewise what is relationship set relationship set means set of relationships a collection of relations set of relationships set of relationships is known as relationship set okay let we have uh three sets so this is nothing but student entity set student entity set and this is nothing but course entity set course entity set so student entity set course entity set let we have three students are there S1 S2 S3 let we have three courses are there C1 C2 C3 and this is nothing but relation what is the relation name here enrolled so enrolled this is nothing but relationship set enrolled relationship set so relation here a set of we know about entity set so set of entities here we have three entities are there S1 is one entity S2 is another entity S3 is another entity likewise here we have three relationships are there even enrolled one enrolled two enrolled three so this is also called as an instance of the relationship an instance of the entity set an an object of the entity set an instance of the entity set let S1 enrolled for course 2 let S1 enrolled for course two let us assume that for that we are using E1 even entity this is enrolled one relation enrolled one relation let student two enrolled for course E1 so for that we are using E2 E2 enrolled two second relationship second enrolled relationship next student three enrolled for course three for that we are using E3 E3 instance okay so this is about what is relationship set now let us see about what is degree of the relationship next concept is degree of the relationship so degree means number of entities participating in that relation number of entities participating in that relation we may have here the degree may be either binary relationship or it may be either tary relationship or it may be either relationship so what is the degree of a relationship number of entities participating in a relationship so binary relationship means if two entities participating in a relation then it is called as binary relationship so this is an example for the binary relationship why because we have two entities which are participated in the relation whereas what is tenary tenary means three if three entities participated in the relation in addition to the student and course let we have teacher also let we need teacher information also let we need teacher information also student course teacher so teacher teaches the student okay for this course so here we have three entities student entity course entity and teacher entity so this is called as tenary relationship next n relationship means if we have more than three entities in your relationship so in addition to that we need to maintain that class information also class information also in which class that class is that subject was uh uh doing okay in which in which section in which class the corresponding faculty is teaching okay so here we have four entities student entity course entity teacher entity and the classroom information classroom entity so four entities means it is anr relation so this is about degree of the relation so degree means number of entities participating in that relation so we may have either binary relationship or tary relationship or n relationship so binary means two entities participated in the relation tary means three entities participated in the relation ternary ternary relationship and the last one is n relationship n relationship means four entities participated in the relation now let us see about mapping cardinality mapping cardinality mapping cardinality or this can also be called as cardinality ratio cardinality ratio so what is cardinality cardinality specifies how an entity in one entity set is related with is associated with another entity in another entity set so what is cardinality cardinality means how an entity in entity set associated with an entity in another relationship another entity set so here mainly we perform the relation on binary relationship so mainly we have four types of associations are there here one to one second one is one to many third one is many to one fourth one is many to one many to one many to many so one to one one to many many to one and many to many so first let us see about one to one one two 1 so here we have entity set a this is entity set a next we have entity set B so what is entity set it contains collection of entities let this it contains uh uh three entities A1 A2 A3 are three entities let it let B contains three entities B1 B2 B3 one to one relation here one to one mapping mapping cinity mapping means how we have to map this entity set with this entity set so what is one to one mapping one: one mapping means an entity in entity set a is associated with at most one entity in entity set B so here an entity in entity set a is associated with atmost one entity in entity set b atmost means maximum so maximum one entity so that means zero or one entity Zer or one entity so here A1 is associated with B1 A1 entity is associated with B1 so only one mapping likewise A3 is associated with only one entity and vice versa that means an entity in entity set B is associated with only one entity in entity set a so what is one 12 one mapping an entity in entity set a is associated with at most one entity in entity set b as well as an entity in entity set B is associated with at most one entity in entity set a so if you take B so here also B1 is associated with only one A1 B3 is associated with only one entity that is A3 so both the conditions are satisfied the best example for this one is Let It Be person let it be a number okay so here A1 A2 A3 are nothing but three persons B1 B2 B3 are nothing but three other numbers so here A1 is allotted B1 other number likewise A3 is allotted B3 other number so in prospective of B B1 is B1 other number is allotted to a A1 B3 other number is allotted to A3 okay so this is about 1 to one mapping so this is about cardinality how an entity in entity set a is associated with an entity in entity set B and the next one is one to many one to many mapping so what is one to many mapping an entity in entity set a is associated with many entities in entity set B but however an entity in entity set B is associated with at most one entity in entity set here so here a can have many entities of B A can have many entities of B but B can have only one entity so here A1 is associated with two entities B1 B2 A3 is associated with only one entity here we should not bother about that so we have to check whether minimum one many relationship is there or not here this A1 has many number of associ iations so that is enough so likewise an entity in entity set B should have only one entity in entity at a so B1 has only one entity B2 has only one entity B3 has only one entity so this is about one too many so let it let it be Department Let It Be employee so let it be CSC Department let it be it department so CSA department has two employees it department has only one employee next employee one is working in CSC Department employee two is also working in CSC Department employee 3 is working in IT department so there is no problem okay so this is about one to many relationship but can we can we make another Association like this no it is not possible why because here many relationship is there so many entities of B2 are attached to single entity but this is not possible and the next one is one to many is V and the third one is many to one many to one mapping so the name itself specifies the meaning so many to one means an entity in entity set a is associated with at most one entity in entity set B so an entity in entity set a is associated with at most one entity in entity set B whereas an entity in entity set B is associated with many number of entities in entity set so for that let us take one more entity A4 let us make another connection here so here B3 is associated with many entities of this entity set so there is no problem so an entity in entity set a is associated with at most one entity of the entity set B whereas an entity in entity set B is associated with many entities of entity at a so for this also you can take department and employee and the last one is many to many so many to many means many entities of entity set a are associated with many number of entities of entity set B likewise many entities of entity set B are associated with many entities of entity set a so let so here we have so so we can make us connections like this so here A1 has association with B1 as well as B2 so many many relationship likewise here B3 has association with A3 A4 if you take subject if you take here let it let it be student it be books so a student can read many number of books next many number of books are given to the students for study so student books so here S1 S1 is reading two books B1 and B2 next B3 uh let this copy is available uh let many copies of B3 is available so this B3 book is given to A3 as well as A4 students so this is about cardinality relation or mapping cardinality so cardinality means how an entity in entity set a is associated with an entity in entity set B we have four types of mapping is there one to one one to many many to one and many to many and the last one is last Concept in year model is participation constraints participation constraints participation constraints here we have an entity set and relationship if every entity of if every entity of entity set is participated in at least at least one instance of the relation at least one instance of the relation then this participation is called as total part participation if every entity of the entity set is participated in at least one entity of the relationship at least you can write instance or you can write at least one entity of the relationship then the participation is called as total total participation whereas if some entities some entities of entity set are participated in uh some entities of the relationship ship then it is called as partial participation why because here only few entities are participated in the relation only few entities are participated in the relation we should not bother about the relation if let the let it associated with one entity or two entities or three entities we should not bother about that okay if every entity of the entity set is participated with an entity of the relationship then it is called as total participation whereas if some entities of the entity set are participated in relation then it is called as partial relation okay in the examination if the question is given on only mapping cardinalities or cardinality ratio then you need to write this answer whereas if the question is given on the relationship then you have to explain all these Concepts what is what is entity what is the use of er model what is entity what is attribute uh next these types of attributes are not needed depends upon the marks you can write if the question is for seven marks then types of attributes are not needed you need to write all these things okay whereas if the question is given on 15 marks okay then you need to write all these Concepts so this is about ER model

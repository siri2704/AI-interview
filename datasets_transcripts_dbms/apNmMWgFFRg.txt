Hello friends! Welcome to Gate Smashers So the next query is Write a query to display all the Department names along with the number of employees Working in that Means, in this table What I have to find out That in each department how many number of employees are working Means, we are talking about department column Employee table department column if you look carefully Then HR, Marketing, HR, Marketing, IT At present I have just added 5 rows Assume it has 40,000 or 50,000 number of employees data is over here So there are many departments So what I have to find out is That see in HR According to this table In HR 2 people are working Ram and Ravi In marketing also 2 people are working Amrit and Nitin In IT there is one Varun So that means over here Output is This should be displayed in the output I have made the output over here So that it is clear to you that actually what we want to display HR 2, Marketing 2, IT 1 Department name HR number of employees 2 Department name Marketing number of employees 2 Department name IT number of employees 1 Means where can you actually use this scenario There can be one more example If I talk about student table If I talk about any university or college There are any branches Chemical, electrical, mechanical, CSE, IT If I ask a simple query That branch wise We have to find number of students In each branch How many students are there How many in CSE, How many in mechanical How many in IT How many in electrical How many in electronics The same scenario we have to find out But how can we do this? What is its logic? First it will come in your mind that we can use where clause Over here where clause will not be used Because, over here multiple condition are going on Department value is not 1 We don't have to just find out That what is to be done in HR Or what is in IT Department wise, we don't know what are values in department Over here we can see just 3 There can be many values It is possible that 1 company has 50 departments So you cannot write where clause 50 times And as it over there after applying where also  I have to count That in each department there are how many people So over here there is a special function Of SQL Or we can also call it a clause It is called a Groupby Over here it will be used Groupby With groupby name only we come to know That group Means I have to solve by the groups We will make group Which means if we make group of departments Like there will be 1 group of HR Marketing will be one group IT group will be one If I talk about the same example There will be one table of CSE One group will be formed One group of mechanical is formed So over here we have to make group So that After creating the groups I can count in that That in each group how many people are there If I made HR HR group  Marketing Marketing group IT IT group I have made it As groups are made You can visualize it like this HR are on one side Marketing are on one side IT are on one side So now from this group We will find out they are 2 These also are 2 And this is 1 So I want to find out this thing So for that I have to take groupby clause help So how do we write groupby clause? Select We will see afterwards that what is to be selected From, select from From where we have to do From employee table This is the important part When SQL query is executed First of all from We have to start to execute first from  Because first of all table From table name Groupby Groupby department I want to make group according to which condition According to department Because I have to find out department That in each department how many employees are there If I talk about student table example Then groupby branch Or groupby trade You can do So groupby Select, what is to be selected That we will see afterwards From employee Groupby department Simple So what we have to do Groupby department Which I had just made This will make group According to the department So HR's own group HR HR HR will come together Marketing Marketing Marketing will come together IT IT will come together In this way group will be made Now I want to find out something from that group But, over here it is important That what can we write with select What with select Eid, Employee name, Salary Or department what can we write So this is the condition of groupby Most important condition of groupby That attribute name This is attribute, department Column The attribute name You are using with groupby Only that attribute You can write with select This is the first condition Now there is one more condition But what is the first condition You can write Only the department You cannot write employee id over here Nor you can write employee name over here Nor you can write salary over here Yes I will definitely tell in some other way But at present if with groupby you have written department Then you can just write department over here This is the important part If other then department Other then the groupby If I want to use some other attribute other then this value Then I have to use the aggregate function I will have to use aggregate function So  I have already told about aggregate function In video Max, minimum , sum, average, count These are the 5 aggregate function Yes now with that aggregate function You can use some attribute But, if you want to use directly Then direct only that attribute will be there Which is written over here So what is the output of this If I check just the output of this Select department from employee groupby department What is made? Simple In this department HR HR on one side Marketing marketing on one side We made it together IT one together But if you will execute this in Oracle Or on SQL server Then it is possible that Marketing is seen at top HR is seen below IT is seen up We are not talking about order We are not talking about simple alphabetical order We are talking HR together Marketing all on one side This is the output So my this work is done HR Marketing and IT is done But how many employees are there in each department For that what I have to apply over here Count function What we have to apply after comma Count function How? Select  Select department, count * Count * Select department  Select department obviously Department is over here so I can use only department Other than that We can use only the aggregate function Select department, count *, you can use this also * means in each one In each value How many HR are there, how many marketing are there How many IT That you can Select department, count department Over here you can also write department There is no problem So select department, count * from employee groupby department As you will execute this Then department, which is the first department? Let's say HR Count department Count, how many count are there in that department How many count is there? 2 Next department Marketing Don't go on order That in order first marketing will come Or HR That depends on how compiler executes But the main point is Output This only will be the output Marketing count * or count department How much is the count? 2 Done, next department is IT  Count * Or count department What is the count? 1 So, this is the output And this output I want so this output will be printed When we execute this command So we have done a very basic command using group by By using groupby By now further we will use groupby in internal subqueries This is all about the groupby function Thank you

hello guys so in this video you are going to see the dbms part 2 series here we'll be going to cover some very important interview questions in dbms so come with me this my first question what is a key and its uses so a keen dbms is an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple or row in a relation or a table the use of key is keys are very important part of relational database model they are used to establish and identify relationships between tables and also to uniquely identify any record or row of data inside a table our question number two is what is primary key and alternate key primary key is unique plus not null i am going to expand it out for you it uniquely identifies a record in relational database table it is a combination of unique and not null constraints there can be more than one candidate key in a relation out of which one can be chosen as the primary key for some instance just wait what is candidate key i'm going to explain it for you till then just remember that in a relation there can be more than one candidate key but primary key is the only one there can they cannot be two primary keys or more than one primary key in a table alternate key the candidate key other than the primary key is alternate key third question is what are primary key constraints in sql a primary key constraint depicts a key comprising one or more columns that will help uniquely identify every tuple or record in a table the fourth question is what are properties of primary key so no duplicate values are allowed that is column assigned as primary key should have unique values no null values are present in column with primary key hence there is mandatory value in column having primary key only one primary keyboard table exists although primary key may have multiple columns no new row can be inserted with the already existing primary key here it is classified as simple primary key that has single column and composite primary key that has a multiple call fifth question is what is candidate key the minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as a candidate key the value of candidate key is unique and not null for every tuple there can be more than one candidate key in a relation candidate key can be simple that is having only one attribute or composite as well what is foreign key so it is an attribute or set of attributes that references to primary key of same table or another table there are the columns of a table that points to primary key of another table they act as a cross reference between tables my question number seven is what are foreign key constraints in sql foreign key is a column that refers to the primary key or unique key of other table so it demonstrates relationship between tables and act as cross reference among them table in which foreign key is defined is called foreign or referencing table table that defines primary or unique key and is referenced by foreign key is called primary or master or referenced table for the table that contains foreign key it should match the primary key in the reference table for every row this is called referential integrity foreign ensures referential integrity a question number eight is what are properties of foreign parent that is being referenced has to be unique or primary key child may have duplicates and nulls parent record can be deleted if no child exists master table cannot be updated if child exists must reference primary key in primary table foreign key column and constrained column should have matching data types records cannot be inserted in child table if corresponding record and master table do not exist records of master table cannot be deleted if corresponding records in child table exist my ninth question is what is a super key a super key is a combination of all possible attributes which can uniquely identify two tuples in a table superset of any candidate key is super key super key in short it is the set of attributes that uniquely identify a double my question number 10 is what is entity entity type and entry set entity any object which has physical existence a particular person car house or employee or it may be an object with a conceptual existence a company a job or a university course an entity is an object of entity type set of all entries is called as entity set eleventh question is what are attributes so they are the properties which define the entity type for example role number name date of birth age address mobile number they are the attributes which defines the entity type student my question number 12 is it's not a question it's kind of important term i have defined here the relationship it is the association between two or more entities for example if you have entity one as student and entity as course so the relationship is study the students study their course so here the two entities are in a relationship now there are some representations how you represent them so your entity is represented by a rectangle attribute is represented by an eclipse and relationship by a diamond so about your attributes for example if you have your entity as student so their attributes can be the name date of birth age number pan number etc here you can see my two entities are represented in rectangle and and the relationship was in diamond shape thank you

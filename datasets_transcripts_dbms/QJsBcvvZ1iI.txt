what is entity attribute and key what is the relationship what is air diagram how to map or convert are modeled into relational table millionaire marketing high level conceptual data models for database design ar modeling er modeling is a technique of representing or the entity relationship model is a graphical designing tool for the implementation of the database system graphically that have been system developed a pictorial represents the technique [Music] the grammatical representation of what the implementation of database system is termed as ar modeling high level conceptual data model for database design imaging requirement analysis conceptual database design logical database design repayment number five physical database design as the last line as the option security design on armada no let's see one by one step one data collection and analysis around now the computer science with demand software and systems synthetic data perspective once all requirements have been collected and analyzed the next step is conceptual schema development in conceptual design minimum denois [Music] next what is the different integrity constraints rule [Music] [Music] of the organization and what is the relationship between them next what are the attributes of each entity that will be stored in the database and what are the integrity constraints you [Music] the actual implementation of the database by using commercial data actual implementation of us that have a journalism most current dbms use an implementation data model such as relational wave demo object data mode limited communication at number five access pass that ocean access how the fire will be organized security anything that exists [Music] it can be anything in which the data can be collected entity an entity can be a regular entity or weak entity an entity air diagram is represented by rectangles representative matter it may be a machine it may be a product it may be a car and extra concept guided muslim account and of course no an example of entities we can compare and contrast this to them to one student using another student representative rectangular [Music] of employees a dependent of employees weak entity whose existence depends on what employee you are normally a dependent entity is represented as a double blind box name you know so that is next what is entity type an entity type defines the collection of entities that have the same attributes a collection of attributes having the same attributes is known as entity type tabletop properties so what is the difference between entity and entity states entity type an identity set that legal not human denominator the collection of all entities of a particular entity type in a database at any point in time [Music] [Music] what is attributes attributes next step attribute is a property our details of an entity property when we diagram is represented as oval shape when the modia grammar is a plane example what are the tribute for students foreign [Music] simple attribute versus composite attribute can not be as simple attributes are not divided into some parts current compositing flag in some matter can be divided into some particular example role number [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in manually in the data is not stored its value is derived or calculated from another attribute select driverless method some mathematical calculation or player again values [Music] [Music] so an entity type usually has an attributes whose value are distinct for each individual identity since search and attribute is called key attribute table that animal is not so what is key a relationship is used to establish the association between the databases what is the relationship between student and teacher learning channel what is the relationship between course and student learning challenges association natural form a narrative by using the relationship you wanna marry no so a situation that exists between two database tables when one table has a foreign key and references the primary key of another table [Music] foreign [Music] relationship [Music] [Music] ruling signifies a role that a particular entity form and it had placed in each relationship instantly example works a foreign of employee or worker and department plays the role of department or employer in animals employees department department to layer loop [Music] necessary for relationship types necessary where all the participating types are distinct distinct columns since each participating type name can be used as error name marginal however in some cases the same entity type participates more than once in relation type [Music] next what is the recursive relationship phenomena recursive in greater relationship means uh the same entity participates in a relationship set more than once so does he and uh [Music] department with [Music] foreign recursive relationship said existed what is constraints on relationship type normal i know so as the name indicates constraint means some limitation the moral have certain constraints or that limit the possible combination of entities that may participate in corresponding relationship states so does it uh hinata mark what is carbonality and what is participation in melanoma now cardinality ratio describes the maximum number of relationship instances that an entity [Music] [Music] [Music] online and tamari and the student id channel one two one one student one student one student have one unique id number one sorry mutual missed that um what is participation means must participate no must work for way management every entity in a regulation in identity state participates at least in one relationship and the organization [Music] [Music] entities in the entity state may not participate in any relationship in the relationship states and indicated by seeing a lie anywhere for example and employing a department with [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] should be database foreign development regulation maria identified narago stay pointless what are the important entities and their attributes within that organization [Music] controls [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign

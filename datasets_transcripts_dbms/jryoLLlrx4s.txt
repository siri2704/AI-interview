[Music] hello everyone welcome to my channel today in this video we going to discuss platform as a service or PAS now if you are new here and you didn't watch the previous video please go to the uh cloud computing series and watch the videos we already discussed there what is mean by cloud computing how it works there are service models and uh infrastructure service model and platform service model and software service model so today in this video we're going to discuss PAS now developer or just programmer uh someone curious about or uh how cloud services work so this video will going to helpful or understanding how platform as services works and why it is so popular so let's start before understanding uh platform as a service let first understand what is mean by cloud computing as already we know the definition of cloud computing it is delivery of uh cloud computing servers or services like server storage database over an internet so uh we are accessing these services remotely rather than relying it in physical hardware or infrastructure so that is something but the cloud computing now platform cloud service model is it is in one of the cloud service model and this allow customer to develop run manage application without dealing with the underlying infrastructure and platform as a service gives the set of tools service to help develop developers or programmer building or coding or you can test it deploy the application quickly and efficiently so platform as a service do not need worry about the server storage networking component they only focus purely on application development so it is like an trunky solution where all the tools and resources you need deploy your application provided by only the platform that is the user didn't worry about the servers networking what what is the storage what are the how and it is not focusing on anything it just only developing or focusing on writing a code uh and the platform takes care of the rest that is the PAS now platform as a services uh provides a platform uh which allow developer for building for testing deploying application without need or underlying the infrastructures like networking or storage so instead of worrying about the servers and network or storage you can only focus on writing a code a tools and platform is already provided now now let understand what are the key features of platform as a services now first key feature is nothing but a development tools now it provides integrated development tool IDE versions control and testing code now this developing code uh provides developing integrated uh environment now uh this is also useful for development process allow you focus on writing a code without having the configuration and developing in for uh environment now next key feature is nothing but the middleware now middleware is nothing but the software by using this middleware services you can manage the database cues catching services which simplify backend development process it also make the automatic scalability if your app get more traffic the platform automatically adjust resources to handle a extra load the next key feature is the manage services now platform as a service include automatic update security patches resource management reducing maintenance burden of the developer that means what if there is a small app and it gets viral you don't have to worry about the adding more servers or more infrastructure or more networking or more uh management it make the automatic update that is nothing but the manage servers the next key feature is the cost efficiency because it use as a pay as go model as a typically resources they they use they only cost effective managing the full infrastructure stack on the premises so that is uh this is all about the key features of platform as a services now it provides a middleware things like database manage managing system etc so platform as a service uh handle all the maintenance and update for you you don't have to worry about or need the security patches software upgrade because they are all done automatic automatically and it keeps like an platform up to date and secure so you might be wondering what are the some of the big uh pass game understand what are the example of the pass provider the first example of past pro provider Google app engine now Google app engine's platform building and deploying the web application it handles the things like scaling load balancing automatically you don't have to worry about the technical details then second is the Microsoft assur app service set of services for building web and mobile app that is it gives or it integrated support on language like net java and nodejs plus it integrates streamlessly with assure services like database and storage also and third one popular is the herokco now this this make the building running and scaling app particular developer to simplify deployment pipeline that is uh it develop or it looking for the simple platform de deploy app and it's very user friendly interface so this is all the all are the examples of a platform provider so these are platform as a service providers which offers a web application mobile app API microservices which offers a higher level abstractions of the infrastructure compared to the IAS that is the infrastructure as a service while stilling providing flexibility over a developer platform as a service uh it choice for building uh use for developing web applications mobile app API mic Microservices and uh whether you are building a e-commerce site social network or blocks platform services provide the infrastructure tools to get you and running quickly and uh if you are building a mobile app platform as a service can provide the back-end services you need like authentication database and file storage this allows you to focus on front end application while platform takes care of everything so platform as a service services is amazing cloud service model that allow developer to focus on building great app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure these features like build development tools authentication scaling management services and uh there is an more developers are running a platform as a service for the application development so this is all about the platform as a service now thank now if you found the

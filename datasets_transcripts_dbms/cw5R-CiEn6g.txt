Hello and welcome to this video on relational 
databases versus object-oriented databases. What is a database? A database is a collection of data that is   organized and stored in a way that 
allows easy access and retrieval.   There are two main types of databases: relational 
databases and object-oriented databases. What is relational database? A relational database is a type of 
database that stores data in tables,   with rows representing records 
and columns representing fields. These tables are related to each 
other through relationships,   which are established using foreign keys.   This allows for data to be linked 
and queried in a structured way. Benefits of Relational Database 1- Simplicity of Model,
2- Easue of use,  3- Data Integrity and Accuracy,  4- Normalization,
5- Data Security Examples of Relational Database Some examples of relational databases include 
MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. What is Object-Oriented Database? On the other hand, an object-oriented database   is a type of database that stores data in the 
form of objects, rather than tables and rows. These objects are organized and stored in a way   that reflects the relationships and 
structures found in the real world. Benefits of Object-Oriented Database 1- Ability to store complex data structures,
2- Support for object-oriented   programming languages, and
3- Ability to handle large amounts of data. Examples of Object-Oriented Database Some examples of object-oriented 
databases include MongoDB and Cassandra. So, which type of database is right for you? It really depends on the needs of your project. Relational databases are great for 
structured data and complex queries,   and they offer strong 
consistency and transactions. Object-oriented databases, on the other hand, 
are better suited for handling complex data   structures and large amounts of data, and they 
offer more flexibility in terms of data modeling. Ultimately, the choice between 
a relational database and an   object-oriented database will depend 
on your specific needs and goals. Thank you for watching. Please

hello everyone my name is a welcome to my YouTube channel we are in the database management series and this is the unit 8 of dbms today's topic is database Security in this unit we will be covering all these topics which you can see on the screen first one is what is data security security versus Integrity the difference between them authentication versus authorization data encryption Access Control DSC m and rbsc which are different Access Control models intrusion detection and SQL injection so let's get started with our very first topic which is data security data security you can understand that right prot that is called as data security Now let's understand this more in a definition terms data security is the protection of the data from unauthorized user unauthorized user ACC somebody who is from outside the company only the authorized users are allowed to access the data most of the users are allowed to access some part of the database that is possible University database so who will be allowed maybe h o will be allowed to access the entire database however the teacher or a faculty will be allowed to see some part of that database yeah fees department so they will be allowed to see some part of that database right access contr datab most of the users are allowed to access the part of the database that is the data that is related to them or related to their Department mostly the DBA or the head of Department can access all the data in the database DBA database administrator yeah the head of Department can access all the data in the database some users may be permitted only to retrieve data whereas others are allowed to retrieve as well as update [Music] data for example you if you go to see the result on your University website you can only just see it you cannot edit you cannot enter the date right so I said different access controls is possible in database now let's understand security versus Integrity security Integrity if you remember initial discuss let's understand the difference between them security deals with the protection of data protect dat however data Integrity deals with the validity of the data validity of the data data security is making sure that only the people who should have access to the data are the ones who can access the data right access access but data Integrity is making sure that the data is correct and not corrupt not corrupt means invalid dat down there data security avoids from unauthorized access of data and data Integrity avoids from Human errors when data is [Music] entered so if you remember discuss we put Integrity constraints data security is implemented through account passwords we can say that but data Integrity is implemented through constraints such as primary key foreign key check constraints which we have discussed already now let's understand authentication versus author authentication is the process of validating the user on the credential username and password validate username and password that is called as authentication but authorization process of verifying whether access is allowed or not access that will come under authorization logging onto a PC or some website or app when you do that with a username and password that is called as authentication but accessing a file or some data from a hard disk or some database that is called as authorization it is the process of verifying who you are authentication and it is the process of verifying what you are authorized to do or not to do that is authoriz ation it is providing Integrity control and security to the data and authorization is protecting to ensure privacy and access control of the data a very thin line of difference but you can see this makes a lot of difference between them now let's understand what is audit Trail or we can call it as audit log also an audit log is a record which will be generated for each and every transactions it will keep certain information about the transaction when a transaction is happening CH chy information about the transaction keeping is called as audit train and audit tril record could have something like who who was the user of the application program and transaction number when what was the date and time exactly from which location of the user and also what identification of the data affected all of those information will be stored in an audit log next topic is data encryption encryption it is a security method in which information is encoded in such a way that only authorized user can understand it for an example social media L you are putting your password the password is not actually going to the other person sitting the website owner it's not going to them it is getting encrypted which means it uses encryption algorithm to generate a cipher text that can only be read if decrypted for example this is the sender over here and he wants to send some sensitive data to the receiver let's say hello is the sensitive data this could be a password of some information it is a plain text after encryption it will become a cipher text which is something else which is KH w r k so while this data is getting transferred if some unauthorized person is trying to access that data he will not be able to access or even understand also that what does this data mean when it reaches to receiver it will reach in a form of a cipher text then with the decryption this text will get converted into a plain text which will be the actual meaning hello and the receiver will receive the message this is called as data encryption it is a process of encoding coding which means a translating a message or information in such a way that only authorized person can access it those who are not authorized cannot access it is the process of translating some plain text or the data into something that appears to be meaningless that is called as Cipher text decryption is the process of converting that Cipher text back to the plain text which we can understand now there are two types of encryption symmetric key encryption and asymmetric key encryption which is also called as private key encryption and public key encryption in symmetric key encryption encryption and decryption keys are the same what does Keys mean which we have seen over here the key which is used to encrypt this data and the key which is used to decrypt this data so the keys in symmetric encryption both are same the same key is used by the sender to encrypt the data and again by the receiver also to decrypt the data same key has been used us symmetric key encryption is very fast in execution now asymmetric difference encryption decryption keys are different public key and private key messages are encrypted by the sender with one key which is public key and can be decrypted by the receiver only by the other key which is a private key receiver private key use and asymmetric key encryption is slow in execution due to high comp computational burden why because the keys are different and the encryption and decryption again takes a little time over there to happen next topic is access control methods now there are three different methods of data access control the first one is called as DC we can call it as discretional Access Control mandatory access control and role based Access Control let's understand them one by one in discretional Access Control the owner of the object object means the data specifies or decides which subject which means the user can access the object which meansa user data access discretional in this method a single user can have different rights on different objects objects as well as different user can have different rights on the same object colum different user different rights same object for an example over here on the student table H has full rights of reading and writing on entire table which means all the three tles over here however cordinator also has read and write full rights over here but on the partial table not on the entire table which means two or one tles SP however faculty over here again has a partial rights which means means not reading or writing maybe one of them and on the partial table maybe one or two tles SP on which this faculty needs to work however as a student user he or she has only reading right which is again a partial rights partially only on one table which is his data this type of control is called a discretional access control a different kind of access is given to different people based on their needs and their designations SQL support access control through Grant and revoke commands command SQL use how do we use a grant this command gives right to user for an object syntax could be Grant privilege on object to user objectable to user with a grant option revoke command this command takes back the rights from the US user for an object syntax could be revoke privilege on object from the user with restrict or Cascade option now the second access control is mandatory Access Control in this method individual user cannot get rights but all the users as well as all the objects are classified into different categories categories top secret is first category secret is second category confidential is third and unclass classified as fourth category each user is assigned a clearance level and each object is assigned a security level clearance level which means this a user can access object of a particular security level only if he has proper clearance level dbms system determines whether the given user can read or write a given object based on some rules these rules make sure that the sensitive data can never be passed to a user without a necessary clearance so clearance rules which is also called as clearance level on the basis of that individual user group on certain objects the access is given mandatory Access Control technique for multi-level security has four components subject it could be user accounts programs or the team entire team also objects it could be relation which is table tles which is all the rows attributes columns views Etc clearance level which is top secret secret confidential unclassified each subject classified into one of these four classes security level again it's the same top secret secret confidential and classified each object can also be classified into this four classes so in the above system TS is greater than S and S is greater than c c is greater than U which means where top secret is greater than S priority means class TS object is more sensitive than the class s object which is very obvious a user can access data by following two rules security property and Star Security property security property states that a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level so if user has an access of a secret object class he would not be able to read the data of the top secret class Star Security property states that a subject at a given security level may not write to any object at a lower security level which means a user which is on secret level will not be able to even write the data on the lower class which means confidential or unclassified class levels also the next one is role based access control rules it it restricts the database access based on person's role within an organization the role in rbac refers to the level of access that employees have to network let's understand it this way that employees are only allowed to access the information necessary effectively perform their job duties and obviously you wouldn't need to access the other data which is not related to your job duties access can be based on several factors such as authority responsibility job competency in addition access to Computer Resources can be limited to specific tasks such as ability to view create or modify a file this could be different types of task which could be performed by you in the database just to view which is read create or modify a file lower level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities using the rbac will help in securing your company's sensitive data and important application at most next topic is intrusion detection what does intrusion mean that somebody is trying to intrude in your data structure or database an intrusion detection system that is a system or a software application that monitors Network traffic or system for suspicious activity or policy violations and issues alert when such activity has been discovered it is a software application that scans a network or a system for harmful activity or policy breaching this is very important because in all such cases the hacking happens on your company's database so this system will really come handy to detect any malicious activity any malicious venture or violation is normally reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management system uh event management system integrates outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to differentiate malaal activity from false alarms also so security information and event management system will help in actually differentiating between actual threatening activity and the false alarm term is SQL injection also our last topic for today SQL injection also known as sqli I is a common attack Vector that uses a malayal SQL code for a backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed you a different type of hack here which hackers use by generating an SQL code which could manipulate the database and access some information which they are not authorized to this information may include any number of items include sensitive company data user list or for private customer details also and a successful attack may result in the unauthorized viewing of user list the deletion of the entire tables gaining some administrative rights to the database all of which are highly detrimental to the business this type of attack is called as SQL injection and here we wrap up our unit eight which is data security these are mostly asked questions in exams according to the university papers please go through them solve them them also it will come very handy for you when you're doing exam preparation if you have any questions any doubts please do mention them in the comment section I will try my best to solve them and to add to that this was our last unit of database management series if you guys have understood this video please give a like and do subscribe my channel as I will be coming up with next subject series very soon and thank you for watching see you next time

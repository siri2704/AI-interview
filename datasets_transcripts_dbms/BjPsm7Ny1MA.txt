hello guys in this video I'm gonna show you how to create entity relationship diagram up an existing database in my secure workbench so this is one of the common requirement for developer or a database designer to create a year diagram up an existing database alright so I'm going to show you how to create a year diagram up an existing database in my secure workbench let me show the sample year diagram so look at here this is a sample year diagram that I have already created you know my circle workbench and I thought that this would be useful for you as well so in this video I am going to show you how to create a similar diagram in a MARSOC of a bench okay it looks good and we can include these er diagrams in our presentations and documents okay so let us see how to create similar year diagram in my soup avenge so I am in a massacre workbench and look at here I have already setup a database this is the classic models database under this database we have a bunch of tables around eight tables and these tables have relationship between each other okay so first step you need to set up the database and it's tables okay and if you don't have database and if you want to practice what you can do is you can just go to the browser and search for my sequel sample database and this is the link so under this link you can find here download my zip code sample database so this database contains these tables and there is a relationship between these tables and this is the ER diagram okay so I have downloaded this database from this website and I have imported this database you know my psycho workbench alright and I am going to show you how to create a year diagram of this database okay so notice the steps here go to the database and choose a reverse engineer okay and look at here this is the result and here you can see stored connection so here you have options like if you want to connect to the remote database then you can choose manage stored connections and from here you can connect to the remote database but in our case we are going to use local database so let's choose local instance of my sequel a connection method let's keep this one tcp/ip host known local host and port username and password so here you need to enter a password for you are my super database and these are the steps we will execute step by step so once you establish a connection I know particular database it next so this will give you the result so far we have connected to the DBMS and we have also retrieved a schema list from the database and we have also checked whether there is any common server combination issues ok so these steps are successfully hit next so basically we have two databases ok you need to choose the database from which you want we want to create a year diagram so we are going to create a year diagram for classic models right so let's choose this schema or a database then hit next so these steps will be for found successfully ok so what are the steps here retrieve objects or tables form the selected schema or a database and the results are successful it next so this database basically contains eight tables ok if you want to exclude table from the database then go to the show filter and here just choose the table that you want to explore from the ER diagram ok for example click on this particular table and click on this so this will basically you know add this table in this section so basically you you can explore customers table from the we are diagram okay now once we add all the tables to the list then what we can do is we can just execute and look at here the steps reverse-engineer selected objects and place objects on the diagram these operations are completed successfully so look at here these are the steps over here so we are now at reverse-engineer step okay once we hit our next it comes to the result steps so look at here is summary so total we have added eight tables in a year diagram it finished and you look at here the ER diagram is generated okay this looks good right so again you can just drag and drop and you can place tables wherever you want this looks good right and again if you want to customize this year diagram so there are a lot of options over here you can just go through these options okay now if you want to export this ER diagram as image or PDF what you can do you can go to the file and look at here this is the export option and choose export as PNG SVG PDF whatever the option you want five million to export this year diagram as a PNG eight PNG and I am just going to save at a download section so here let's give a name to the file let us say a diagram sample save it so let me quickly go to the Downloads folder and this is look at here this is the ER diagram sample that just we have exported okay so this is the year diagram that just we have created you know my Seiko workbench this looks good right great so I highly recommend you guys to use my Sakura brains to create such er diagrams and it's very useful for us whenever we want to I know present some you know something which is related to database then we can use Jana diagrams alright guys I hope you found this video tutorial useful subscribe to my youtube channel whenever I will publish such videos you will get notified thanks for watching I will see you in the next video

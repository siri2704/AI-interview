[Music] hey guys welcome to another dbms tutorial today we'll be learning introduction to relational dbms or rdbms also it is called so let's get started first we'll start with an example so that the concept is clear from the beginning itself all right so let's look at an example let's say there is a table called account okay now why are we comparing a dbms or relational dbms with a table because relational database consists of lots of tables all right so let's say we have an account table okay now let's say this is the table now what can you see there are three headers over here account number branch and balance amount right so these are three headers of this table now as you can see these are the characteristics of each account that is present in the bank okay if you have a bank account you must know that that account will have account number then your bank account will have a branch in which it is open and the balance amount that is obviously every account number will have a balance amount so these three headers represent the attributes or the characteristics okay so in terms of relational database language you call it attributes okay now the next thing that comes is a row okay now what can you see in this row what does it mean a row represents data that is related to each other okay let's say for example over here we have got account number four five six seven okay and the account numbers branch is borrowed the amount or balance amount related to that account is 500 so all this information is related to each other so a row is called tuple now the next thing we can see over here is a column now why is it called a domain because it represents only a single type of data okay as you can see over here branch it will have only the branch names or this column over here called account number it will have only numerical value or data of a single type all right similarly over here balance amount it will be of the single type of data so hence it's called a domain okay now these are three important words attributes tuple and domain in a relational database now once that is clear for you then it will be easy for you to continue with the topic now let's see what are we going to cover in today's tutorial first we'll look at the comparison between relational database true table all right we have already seen that now and the next thing what is an attribute then comes what is a tuple what is a domain and now we are starting with the first one that is what is an attribute all right now attribute is property of the entity okay just like we have seen the column header represents an attribute the next thing is the account number then the branch in which that account number was open and the balance amount of that account number okay so a tuple means uh related information to a single unit entity all right now the next thing that is is a domain okay now what is a domain a domain d is a set of atomic values now what is the meaning of atomic values atomic values means the individuals that is you cannot divide them further into any other categories all right now let's say in a column we had the branch name okay now branch name you cannot specify like you cannot divide a branch of baroda into something more okay or let's say there is a information about the account number you cannot divide the account number into two different parts okay so that is what you mean by uh atomic values okay so they cannot be divided further okay now the next thing is and we have seen the example already okay that was the column that contained the branch number or the column that contained the account number similar examples are 10 digit mobile number so you cannot divide a mobile number further into two things okay or an aadhaar number third thing is name of a person now this can be listed in one column because they are single type of data okay so this is a domain now we'll do the revision first thing what is the relation between a relational database and a table basically a relational database is a combination of multiple tables which can be stored individually as a file okay now over here we had seen an example of a table called account and in terms of relational database how it works basically the account number branch and the balance amount these three headers are the attributes of the account all right so these are three attributes the next thing is a row is a unique combination of information that is related to each other of a particular unique entity okay so the account number is related to the branch and the balance amount is related to the account number so related information in a row is called tuple and finally the domain is a list of similar type of information or information of the same data type all right so these are the three main important parts of a relational database if you want to learn more i have made more videos on this topic i'll put the link in the description below if you have any doubt feel free to ask them in

hello friends in this session I will be discussing the concepts of ER diagrams I will be discussing some extended concepts so in this session I will be specifically covering this concept of specialization so let's see what specialization main means it is closely linked to generalization and aggregation so I'll be after this I will be covering those concepts as well so let's start with specialization first what a specialization so the definition is that an entity set may include sub groupings of entities that are distinct in some way from other entities in the set okay so what it actually means that you may have an entity set weight which have some members which are distinct from each other and on the basis of that we can actually form their subgroupings fight for example a subset of entities within an entity set may have attributes that are not shared now this is the condition when such thing can occur so it may happen that some of the entity set have and some of the entity sets have an active attributes which are not shared by other empty sets for example let's move on to the example we have the example of entity set person so a person may be classified as an employee or a student now we all of you all of us know that employee and student have some distinct characteristics for example a student may have a salary a sorry an employee may have a salary but a student may not have a salary a student may have a unique rule number right so and we can say that there are a certain set of total credits which are associated with the student but it is not the case in case of an employee so that is an example of that case then in such a case what we can do is we can we can basically form two sub groupings of this entity set person and the subgroupings will be employee and student so that is the basic notion specialization now let's move into the details slowly so the process of designating subgroupings within an entity set is called specialization and if I define it formally what will it be it is the process of taking subsets of a higher level lengthy set for example in this discussion the high level in tea set is person so subsets of a high level entity set to form lower level entity sets so which are the new entity sets which are the lower level entity entity sets that we formed over here they are the employee and the student so we can also define it as the process of divine in defining subclass based on the basis of some distinguished characteristics what were those distinguished characteristics they were salary and total credits of the entities of the superclass fine of the entities of the superclass for example an account entity set can have subclasses as current account and saving account so an account can be classified as a current account and a saving account but the attributes of both accounts may differ right so how can they differ let's see it with the help of a diagram so we can also classify in the similar manner we can also classify a a an employee further as teaching staff or non teaching staff so if I just see its diagram it may be represented like this now this is the person which was a high level entity set right which has been sub group as employee and the student and this employee had against is basically a high level entity set with respect to these lower level entity sets which are teaching staff and non teaching stuff so an employee can be categorized as a teaching staff him employee or a non teaching staff an employee and a teaching staff basically any professor or something has a rank right he has a particular designation he might be a processor and assistant professor or a professor or an associate professor but a non teaching staff can be categorized or can be distinctly identified as us having a salary on the basis of hours per week ewoks whereas the teaching staff will be having a fixed salary late so this was an example again of specialization and so in some of the books it is represented like this in in court basically this convention is followed but otherwise whenever we hear the concept of specialization or generalization they always say that you represent it with the help of an inverted triangle so in gate you might get this question maybe just as a one knock or something all you might just get this question and say what is this basically depicting this concept it is the big thing so all what are the high level and the lower level lengthy sets in this so in this case again if I say the count has the attributes as now these are the generalized attributes which are there in this high level empty set they are account numbering balance then it is split into current account and saving account now saving account has interest rate and overdraft amount as their attributes account is a so it has an inverted triangle over you okay it is an inverted triangle and so what it is basically representing is that this high level empty set is basically a type of saving account or a current account that means this is a high level 90 set these are the lower level subsets of it okay so now you can clearly see how these are distinguishing each other because this has an interest rate where else this has an overdraft amount so that's all of this session that's all for this session of specialization in the next session I will be covering the concept of generalization and we'll be slowly moving on to aggregation and we'll also see what are the differences between both the pain both generalization and specialization so stay tuned for more good work coming up thank you keep boiling designer thank you French

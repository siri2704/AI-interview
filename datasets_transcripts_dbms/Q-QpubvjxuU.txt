welcome back in this video I will discuss different types of attributes in dbms with the help of simple examples there are mainly six types of attributes in dbms first one is known as simple attributes second one is composite attributes single valued attributes multivalued attributes derived attributes and key attributes we will discuss each of these different type of attributes one by one first one is a simple attribute a simple attributes are those attributes which cannot be divided further for example in this case you can notice student is a entity role number class and age are the attributes of student entity we cannot divide each of these attributes further hence these are called as simple attributes coming back to the second type of attribute that is known as composite attribute composite attributes are those attributes which are composed of many other simple attributes for example again in this case student is a entity role number is a simple attribute because we cannot divide this role number further but when it comes to address address is a composite attribute because address is composed of many other simple attributes like Street City Country and state which constitutes the address attribute here similarly name is a composite attribute because name is a combination of first name middle name and last name over here hence uh role number is a simple attribute address and name are composite attributes in this case coming back to the next type of attribute that is known as single valued attribute single valued attributes are those attributes which can take only one value for a given entity so in this case again student is a entity role number age date of birth and gender are the attributes here each of these attributes can take a single value we cannot have two different role number for a given student we cannot have two different ages for a given student and so on hence all of these are a single valued attributes in this case coming back to the next one that is known as a multivalued attribute multivalued attributes are those attributes which can take more than one value for a given entity for example in this case student is a entity role number and age are single valued attributes because we cannot have more than one value but if you consider mobile number and email ID a student can have more than one mobile number as well as a student can have more than one email ID here so that's the reason mobile number and email ID are known as multivalued attributes in this case multivalued attributes are represented with two ows coming back to the next type of attribute that is known as derived attribute derived attributes are those attributes which can be derived from other attribute or attributes in this case for example in this case role number gender and data birth are simple valued attributes on of a student entity age is a derived attribute because if you know the value of date of birth of a student we can easily find the age here so that's the reason age is known as derived attribute in this case coming back to the last type of attribute that is known as key attribute key attributes are those attributes which can identify an entity uniquely for example we can uniquely identify the student with the help of role number because every student has different role number gender and age may be same because uh there are only two types of gender male and female and age can be same but role number of every student is different hence role number is known as key attribute for the given entity in this case so in this video I have discussed what are the different type of attributes in dbms with the help of simple examples I hope the concept is clear if you like the video do like and share with your friends press the Subscribe button for more videos press the Bell icon for regular updates thank you for watching watching

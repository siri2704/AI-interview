hello everyone in this video we will see what are the advantages and disadvantages of dbms so first we will look at the advantages and then we will go for the disadvantages so the first advantage of dbms is it is easy to maintain so it can be easily mintable due to the centralized nature of the database system means the data is stored in different kind of databases and it is easy to manage those databases so First Advantage is easily maintainable or you can say that easy to maintain now the next Point comes is it controls the data redundancy so it can control the data redundancy because it stores all the data in different kinds of database files that recorded data in different databases and it also follows the concept of normalization so that it will help databases to reduce the redundancy so it controls data shridden Dempsey data stored in the database is easily accessible to multiple users so it allows data sharing it also provides an interface to write queries now query language is also provided by the dbms it is also a advantage of using a dbms to write queries for accessing and Performing different operations and performing different kinds of operations on database so it provides an interface that is also an advantage of using a dbms it reduces the time means it reduces the development time and also the maintenance needed also it reduces the response time whenever multiple users are accessing data in like from the database it also reduces the response time so it reduces the response time now the last and the most important advantage of using dbms is it provides security it provides the recovery and backup of the data so it provides security some of the point we have already discussed when we have studied about the characteristics or you can save features of the dbms so it provides the backup and the recovery of the data so any failure will not cause any loss of the data so that is the biggest advantage of the dbms now let's talk about the disadvantages of dbms so the first disadvantage of dbms is it the cost of the hardware and software so it requires a costly hardware and software to manage the database so the cost of the hardware and software of a dbms is quite high that increases the budget of the organization so cost of hardware and softwares is high so it can cause a problem for the startups or for the smaller organizations so dbms requires a high speed of data processor large memory size so these all things these all hardware and software will cost very high now the next problem comes with the dbms is the size so it occupies large space of disk or large memory to run them efficiently so the next problem is of size after then the problem comes of the complexity now most dbms system are often complex system so training of the users to use the dbms is required means the user who are managing or maintaining the database they have to be very much skilled to process to manage that highly complex system so complexity of the database is also a problem now there is a higher possibility of the failure Suppose there are some organization that is based on the centralized database there all the data is stored in a single database and if there is any failure in that database then the loss of the data will occur and they will like they will just loss all the data that is stored in that database so there is high possibility of failure so these are some of the disadvantages that comes with the dbms and there are some advantages also that will provide us security it controls data redundancy data sharing it provides it is easy to maintain and other benefits also that dbms provides so these are some of the advantages and disadvantages of dbms let's see who are the users of dbms so that we will discuss in the next video that's all for this video thank you

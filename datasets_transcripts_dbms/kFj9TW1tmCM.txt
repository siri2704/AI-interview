hello friends in this session I'm going to cover the topic of generalization in the previous session we saw how what the concept of specialization means and now generalization is very closely related to specialization yoga is slowly going to get into the details of generalization and then we are going to see how they both differ so let's start with it what is the basic definition the definition is the refinement from an initial entity set into successive levels of entity subgroupings represents a top-down design process in which distinctions are made explicit so what it actually means is generalization is actually a top-down design concept in this definition it is saying a top-down design one concept wherein you are basically trying to identify from an initially NT site you are basically trying to identify which are the generalized attributes or you can say which is the entity which can be generalized to a higher level so basically over here the important thing that you can notice that in case of generalization your basic goal is to identify a higher level entity set all as generalized entity set having a certain set of generalized attributes fine so it is in some way related to specialization now let's just continue with this so we have the design process may also proceed in a bottom-up manner yes it may also proceed in bottom-up manner in which multiple entity sets are synthesized into a high level entity set on the basis of common features again the same thing which I just discussed so a generalized hierarchy is a form of abstraction so clearly a high level entity set basically means it is some abstract concept that specifies that two or more entities that share common attributes can be generalized into a high level entity set and this is called a super type or a generic entity set and the lower level entity sets are called the subtypes of this super type and subtypes are also as all also are also called as the dependent entities now if you quickly see an example of the same we have this employee entity said hey this is a initially entity set we have the M number m f-- name basic pay and allele it now this employee can be categorized as a salaried employee or the regular employee I can say and then as an hourly employee on the basis of these two different attributes so there are a certain set of employees we can say which differ on the basis of these two attributes and therefore what identifies employee is a generalized employee over here it is a generalized abstract concept which has these two attributes as the general or the common attributes right and then I can split it into these two things which is salaried employee I'll employ basic pay an hourly rate that they're specific with their respective asset boots now if you just if you had just viewed the video of specialization you would know that we followed the same diagram or a similar diagram in that case so over there what I would say is over there the main motive was to identify these subsets but over here the motive is to identify this generalized attribute with a generalized entity with its generalized a kibbutz so that is why I said both of the concepts are closely related to each other so let's let's quickly see the difference I've already explained you the difference but let's just see the rafted points so the difference between both specialized in a specialization and generalization is that specialization emphasize or emphasizes on differences among the entity sets by creating distinct lower lower level entity secreting distinct lower level entity sets and then the lower level entity sets may have attributes or me participating relationships that do not apply to all entities in the higher level entity sets okay so the lower level entity sets may have attributes or may participate in dilution trips that do not apply to all the entities in the higher level and visits so that you can quickly follow this from this dagger that this saving account in current account they differ on these attributes interest rate and overdraft amount which are not there in this generalized what generalized entity rate which is account so the common ones are these but the lower level entity sets which are these they differ on these attributes okay so then we have generalization emphasizes on identifying or abstracting out a generalized entity called the super type which can represent the common attributes or some lower-level entity sets which are the subtypes for example if I follow the same example I would say that account number and balance these attributes are common to both of these types of accounts which is the saving occur so that's all for this session of generalization and the differences among generalization and specialization hope you liked the video in case you did please click the like button and stay tuned for mobile to are coming up in the next session I'll be covering the topics of aggregation and the topic of aggregation so stay tuned and keep following the channel thank you

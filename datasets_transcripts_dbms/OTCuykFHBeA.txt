hello friends and welcome back to steady tonight's YouTube channel in this video we will learn about the fourth normal form this is the sixth video in a database normalization series so if you haven't watched the earlier videos we suggest you do before this one for a table to be in the fourth normal form it must satisfy two conditions it should be in bcnf and there should be no multi-value dependency to satisfy second normal form we removed partial dependency and then in the third normal form we removed transitive dependency and this time it is multivalued dependency so let's see what multivalued dependency is a dependency a derives B is said to be multi-value dependency if for a single value of a more than one value of B exists in a table also for a table to have multivalued dependency it should have at least three columns because if we have only two columns in a table we can simply distribute the multi-value data into multiple rows and there is no need for decomposing the table and the two other columns must not depend on each other so we have three points which when occurred together leads to multivalued dependency and they are for a derives B if for single value of a more than one value of B exists table has at least three columns and for a table with columns ABC if a and B have a multivalued dependency then B and C should be independent of each other if all these are true for a table it will be having a multivalued dependency also in a table multivalued dependency can exist for more than one columns too let's take an example to clear all the doubts so we have a table with s ID which is student ID course which is the course opted by the student and the hobby of the student there add data to our table as you can see one student has opted for two subjects and has two hobbies you must be thinking what problem this could lead to well student with si D one has hobby cricket and hockey and has opted for subject science and maths these two rows of data will give rise to two more additional rules isn't that right and there is no relationship between course obtained and hobby of the student hence it's always advice to keep such attributes in separate independent tables now this can be decomposed into two tables to solve the problem of multi value dependency and to make this relation satisfies the fourth normal form this is how the decomposed tables will look like with student ID and course in one table and student ID and hobby in a separate table in some cases a table can have functional dependency and multivalued dependencies together for example if we add a dress to our table a table will look like student ID address course and hobby clearly address of student will be functionally dependent on s ID while we have multi value dependency between s ID and codes and s ID and Hobby so this table will be decomposed into three tables to make this relation satisfy the fourth normal form multivalued dependency occurs due to bad database design for example if we have two tables student and course with s ID and s name in student table and c ID and C name for course in the course table keeping both the tables separate is a good database design but what if someone decides to keep all the data together in one tip if we do a Cartesian product of the tables and try to keep data in a single table it will look like this and clearly we have multi value dependency in this situation so design your database carefully and with this we now know what multivalued dependency is and how to make adulation satisfy the fourth normal form if you liked this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and do subscribe to the study tonight's YouTube channel see you in the next video

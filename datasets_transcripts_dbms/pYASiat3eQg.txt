hello and welcome to my channel making it simple in my previous video I explained about first normal form and before we move on to Second normal form we need to clear some Concepts so that we will be doing in this video we are going to learn about partial dependency we have seen what is the functional dependency now let us understand when is functional dependency called partial dependency let's start after a really short intro together foreign [Music] let us start with an example and then come to the theoretical definitions so let's assume we have a relation or Tableau it has four attributes a b c and d now this relation R has some functional dependencies as follows by using a and b together we can identify d and using attribute B we can find or identify C so using a b we can find out c and d and also a and b that means we can identify all the attributes present in this relation using a and b therefore we can say that a b together is a candidate key and by using the candidate key A B we can identify the complete Tuple this is called as closure a b closure will give us all the four attributes a b c and d now as we know in the following relation a b is the candidate key based on that we can differentiate the attribute in two types first one is prime attribute and another one is non-prim attribute so the attributes that are part of candidate key are called as Prime attributes in this example attribute a and attribute B both are prime attributes attribute C and attribute D which are not part of candidate key are non-prime attributes by using prime attributes we can find or identify the non-prime attributes note that in this example we have a small relation or a table so it has only one candidate key and therefore that will become the primary key as well but in many cases there can be multiple candidate Keys present in the relation so all the attributes present in those all candidate keys are called Prime attributes okay so now we understood what is prime attribute and what is non-prime attribute now let's focus back on functional dependencies let's see the first one attribute or dependent D is determined by determinant a b D is determined using candidate key so there is no problem with this functional dependency second one is dependent C is determined by determinant B now B is not a candidate key but it is a part of candidate key Now understand this carefully when a non-prime attribute in this case C can be determined using part of candidate key in this case b this type of functional dependency is called as partial dependency as it depends on the part of candidate key and not on complete candidate key it is said to be partial dependency in the above case a non-prime attribute can be determined using complete candidate key so this is not a partial dependency so the definition for partial dependency goes as follows partial dependency in a dbms occurs when a non-prime attribute depends on the proper subset or we can say part of the candidate key to identify partial dependency in relation you must follow these steps in the first step you must identify candidate keys in a relation in the Second Step you must differentiate Prime and non-prime attributes and in the last step you need to find a non-prim attribute that is determined by a part or a proper subset of a candidate key that is all for today's video hope you understood the concept if my videos help you in clearing the concepts and your doubts leave a like and share the video with others in need and for more such amazing videos subscribe my channel making iot simple and press the Bell icon to get latest video notifications see you in the next video thank you

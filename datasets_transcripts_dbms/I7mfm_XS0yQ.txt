hello everyone So let's talk about database choice So this is a very important aspect of the interview as the interviewer would expect you to answer as to why are you selecting a particular database for your design and you might use multiple database in a single system as well So you need to provide a very good reasoning and trade-offs as to why you are selecting a particular database So as you know that we have two different type of database Okay So one is the NoSQL database and other is a SQL database So in this as well we have four different type of NoSQL database Key value document column value and graph database Okay And uh each has a different purpose but as to high level like why are you going to select a NoSQL database So it is very good for horizontal scalability So currently we have a lot of distributed systems that are there Okay And for that we need to have horizontal scalability For that NoSQL database handles it perfectly So that is another good reason It provides data consistency as well And uh if you want different kind of scenario like if you want a full text search then you can maybe use elastic search which is NoSQL You can use Dynamo DB So there are different kind of database which you can use in NoSQL We have MongoDB as well which which we use a lot Okay So it is a type of document store database Okay Now coming to SQL So as you know it is a relational database Okay Relational database means for structured data we can use uh the SQL database means the data can be organized in the form of tables It has the property of atomicity Only a single transaction will be performed It is very good for vertical scaling I'm not saying we cannot use it for horizontal scaling If there is a good design for SQL database we can definitely horizontal scale it as well We can join multiple tables as well Okay So here you can see like customer ID So it is a foreign key in this particular table Okay So we can kind of play around with it Okay And we have to design it well We need to know which database So now what idea do you got like which database will you use okay So you need to understand in depth as to why you want to use a particular database You need to have a good idea and you need to communicate it well with justifications with points like horizontal scalability Okay here I need consistency Here I need atomicity Okay here I need to retrieve data in the form of key value Here I need complex joins in my data So this is all about it Okay so this is all about database and I will cover a in-depth video as well in the future videos Okay be around

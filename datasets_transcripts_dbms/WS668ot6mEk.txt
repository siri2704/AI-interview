welcome back I hope you're doing great as a part of this video we'll understand what are the ways of storing the data in the previous video we understood we do need data for deriving the insights for deriving the patterns and for any future use if we need data we need to store it right now the question is how do we store the data where do we store the data let us try to understand how do we store the data assume that you have gone for a vacation and you would have taken a nice pictures of you and your friends or your family there are thousands of pictures how do we organize them one of the way of organizing your pictures which are nothing but a data will be in a least isn't it put that into your folder and we'll have wonderful pictures nandi Hill start jpeg Los Angeles rudo Drive jpeg New York liberry Gateway of India multiple pictures are there but if you have thousands of pictures this is one way of organizing the data you can organize your data in the least as I said there are thousands of pictures here within that if you if you're trying to search for a particular picture then it takes time right so what is the better way to organize our data we can organize our data in hierarchy like we can create a folder for a particular place like my Karnataka Bangalore Karnataka Mumbai Maharashtra New York USA and all the pictures related to Karnataka and mour can be stored in this particular folder then it is easy to find the pictures which belong to myour and Karnataka definitely organizing the data in hierarchy is much better than the list but it has its own pitfalls like if you want to search your pictures by date if you want to search the pictures by a name of a person in that picture then we may have to create multiple folders within the folders then what is the solution that is where we got a wonderful solution we can organize the data in a table like you have a columns like country state city picture and date in whatever the way you want to search for a picture you can go ahead and filter based on a country you can go on filter based in a city you can filter based on the date so if you organize the data in a table it will be easy for us to navigate through the data and easy for us to retrieve the data which we want at that particular point in time wonderful we understood the different ways of organizing the data thank you [Music]

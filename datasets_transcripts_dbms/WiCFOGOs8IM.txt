hello everyone welcome to SQL my name is naresh Sagar next month is low SQL and 820 code slope yesterday so first of all what is an SQL and next term what is the importance of SQL and 820 Concepts next to exactly what we covered in this so watch this video and up to you right first of all what is an SQL what is lsql and uh how to abbreviate SQL means SQL is a structured query language SQL is a structured query language foreign we can design the data base we can design the database data base we can design the database so that the database is also a relational database algorithm a relational database no design chain and awesome relational relational data based no design chain write relational database means data represented in a database as a relation as a table relation is nothing but the table here and then information right so next to what exactly lsqn is still SQL abbreviated as a structured query language structured a query language and the next term this SQL is a standard database language which is used to create maintain I'll retrieve the relation relational database [Music] relational data based no management foreign language which is used to manage the relational database relational data based no manage my relational database and then the okay relational database means data represented in the form of table a relational database and database and dbms 820 Concepts SQL is used to manage the relational database so that the management nothing but to create the table I wanted to maintain the table I needed to retrieve the data from table so click tables alignment created tables [Music] [Music] definition language data definition language and DML DML data manipulation language language [Music] and the next turn TCL TCL TCL transaction control language and dql data query language sub language so what is ddl commands by using this ddl commands we can create create the database we can create the database we can create the table at a database we can create the data database we can create the database data base we can create the database and tables views views ilda usage indexes triggers procedures next to DML commands by using DML commands we can manipulate the data in database DML abbreviated as data manipulation language that means by using DML commands we can insert a insert insert the data in a database or limited table today whatever we created by using ddl comments a ddl command slow uds.20 okay create distance view slogan data insertation and uh updates language but by using the CL commands we can give the permissions to user at a user a data and uh so the complete the restrictions maximum provides a security to the data data Security provide yes not accessed by unauthorized users unknown persons database DBA can provide the permissions is data control language commands data control language commands okay so permissions and a um foreign foreign and the next turn TCL transaction control language that means operation database earlier than the Oliver table on your table so right so a transaction and 820 commit foreign foreign just this is about a name what is NH still and yes very brief information right so structured query language by using structured query language we can manage the relational database relational data based and advantages structured very language query language students database questions columns right like this is the table this is the table so what table is this it is the student table student table student Enlightenment database columns and ruska a representation combination of rows and column is nothing but a table summary put a student is a student having age age of this student so like this okay right like this name and the next age of the student like this age of the student and the next one more student and a student like this and a student name is a warning okay and the age of the student okay all right on D4 and the next one more student like this okay so data unite 20 the student name is a ramu like a next age of the student is 26 like this like this is foreign foreign foreign language okay quotes foreign introduction to SQL and then presenting what is an SQL and the next yes what is that the database okay a database uh dbms and uh rdbms dbms database management system rdbms means relational database management system and what the definitions are discussed as to and what mother or differences ending what is the dbms and what is rdbms or Advantage conception and the next term SQL standards mni foreign foreign foreign and the next tune and the second chapter purchasing data retrieval techniques and that means first of all how to create a table in database database dot table and 8.20 data insertation how to retrieve data data is put them Hitler selected yes by using different concepts data retrieval techniques okay so Dean claw data alignment as a column wise Hitler is names that means alternate names and the next having class and the next Stone from class 9820 the name yet Group by class order by class using class and uh some constraints constraints and Equity vertical strengths that means uh restrictions are related rules while creating a table table creation time long some rules working with the ddl commands exactly how to use ddl commands ddl commands data definition language commands data definition language comments ddl abbreviated as data definition language data deflation language right and the next creating table from another table already work a table and 823 create a YouTube next to a table and 820 ideas foreign column names column names rename unconditionally we can delete the data system [Music] and the next two fourth chapter okay DML comments working with the DML commands working with the DML commands DML commands means data manipulation language comments data manipulation data manipulation language commands very data manipulation language inserting Raw in existing a table and existing table law already table and advantages if you want the update if you want to change if you want to modify so update command ujc data connected the name modified and uh modification and next term whatever the data you not required we need to delete the data a data delete an adventure by using DML commands of a project that means how to insert a data how to update data how to delete data on a2011 foreign foreign and the next two and after Integrity constraints next build so built-in functions means system defined functions already some functions defined by system and by our system law already functions NT and what type of functions are there and 20 Concepts built-in functions string functions are the date functions and the mathematical functions and conversion functions and special functions and analytical functions and Advantage Concepts built-in functions data aggregate operations aggregate operations aggregate operations aggregate functions because something is a different is there a difference what exactly AMD and advantage and whatever it may be having class and uh foreign and uh are joining and it went to the indigo asaram and the 120 types of joints in the united concept of green chikla importance of joints and identity Concepts some very important things okay it is uh okay combine the more than one file more than one very combined chairs more than one query combined child operators and pseudo columns that means some logical columns and automatically generated okay foreign different uh okay root query and facing parent query and the pressing child query and the president of different types of queries what exactly sub query and a sub query sub queries database transaction and security and Advantage TCL and a DCL comments DCL and next TCL comments know the transaction control language data control languages chapter foreign and the next synonyms indexes and the next clusters and next materializer views okay Concepts and another one is uh PL SQL part PL SQL part procedural language Extinction to SQL PL SQL means procedural language Extinction to SQL and that means Advanced to SQL SQL something is Advanced is called PL SQL but if what is PL SQL and a PLS in the pl SQL data type Center and then structure ND and the next what kind of statements we are using foreign and the next after the term understanding exception handling concept exception is nothing but a real-time error or real time and the next two creating of a store to procedures stored procedures under procedure alignment what is procedure and next term how to create procedure and next term so how to create a procedure with the cursor and 820 Concepts creating and using functions in the pl SQL PLS creating and using packages and the next okay why we are using packages and packages specification in the package body entry and the next one a package and 823 okay how to initialize instantiated Package filex Store packages statements into an equity Concepts trigger nothing but it's uh one of the rule Rule and important foreign foreign right so foreign with the website okay updates and uh keep utilize this batch thank you welcome to SQL so SQL news website uh pythonlife.in oracle.html so your website is demo related classes coming all details on 8.3 website law available completed duration 45 days so duration and advantages not only one day not only two days not only one week so entire 45 days every day towards uh batch timings foreign foreign okay Oracle 10g foreign right and uh we will wait for some couple of minutes so because of here it is uninstalling the software and after that we will go for instance right here it is uninstalling the Oracle tangent files and installing 10g files here right yes we need to wait sometime we need to wait some time it is going to uninstall all applications whatever the related to Oracle and Oracle alignment to the initials available right it is completed installation installation completed and then we go for removed from this list again here Oracle related file is there I will uninstall that one also all right and uh yes okay so from here there is no Oracle files there is no Oracle files then we go for uh install the application I have a setup okay so I'm double click on this file right so double click on that file yes do you want to allow this file other than this application in your system yes I am pressing on S right it is going to installing it is going to installing configuring all the files here it is going to configuring all the files is preparing to install preparing to install here so here also it takes some time to install and be careful while installing the software what options we are using just uh here click on next next that is the enough and also same as Oracle 12C also we will see any almost similar steps just clicking on next and next that's enough that's enough right be careful while choosing a course to learn foreign how to interact with the doubts recorded videos nickname uh available and here and click on next just click on next right ly I accept the terms in the license agreement yes click on that and next click on next button click on next button and uh this one is uh in which location in your system it is going to install at a C drive C drive and it is created as a Oracle exe5 right next time next and uh here it is asking a password that means after installation we need to okay connect it to one uh default user that the username is called assist to connect to sys account we need to enter this password whatever we are using here so here I am using one password like t i g e r like a tiger so and the next confirm password tiger and uh click on next button yes and install so it is going to install the application it is going to install the application right so here also it takes some couple of minutes write it takes time sometime so Madam yes start testing beginning of this video okay okay so my names are equal to be registration responsibility okay demo classes okay everything check properly then only go for Android in recorded websites if you get any doubts nobody available to explain to you so economics foreign class right it is going to install it is going to install so it should take a few minutes of time yes [Music] almost uh end of the installation foreign yes it's finished now yes installation successfully completed here and go for your control panel control panel here also control panel very beginning law already 120 where I can uninstall Islam and an installation see here Oracle files are there or not an iPhone yes again the restored here and here these are the Oracle files right and see here don't use this one to login and next here go file click on start button and here we have a folder like Oracle database 10g Express Edition expand that form and here one SQL command line yes yes okay so here connected connect to home connect to sys account this as sys db8 this is DBA this is a what default user defaulty user and semicolon enter and use your password initially what we created right so connected this is a way of installing SQL and connecting to default user here we are creating user user management foreign so this is a very basic level how to install and how to uninstall an 820 concept right so we will go for this video thoroughly and uh install your software perfectly if you have any doubts and uh write in our comment session right so this is the website pythonlife.com in slash oracle.html is the website here details is available to this batch and go through all these uh all these things and and wrong enroll to new bags right thank you thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL foreign foreign [Music] foreign Oracle data types Oracle data types so data types in bracket and previous video in our previous video so we discussed about introduction of SQL SQL introduction connected and the next what is database what is rdbms what is dbms and 820 Concepts no discussion and a Concepts implementation yes that means relational database management system and the data represented in a table at a table for Metro data on 820 foreign to maintain relational database we are using SQL structured query language and a first to be required a data types foreign type of the data type of the type of the data okay type of the data to store in to store in database to store in data base that is called a data type data type is nothing but the type of the data to store in database is called data types simple definition what type of data types we are using in SQL to create a table so this is depends on your requirement it may be character data it may be numerical data or it may be both the combination of character kind of numerical or it may be day to data type that means date formatted data or it may be video format audio format so what type of you want to go to store data in database foreign foreign size so see here this data type is used to store character strings characters string values of fixed length fixed length size so this is a way of representing character data type enabled table representation okay generally here is a keywords in parenthesis to know character name that the column can access to the only character value see here for example this is a table this is a table of a student table student and in this table in this table so here different The Columns are there so for example student name assume that student name student s yes your Channel any characters the name foreign okay 255 characters 255 characters so it depends on your requirements depends on your requirement we can use in between this number a day 1 to 255 characters low requirement and wages field name column name find it character data type and class size 10 characters 10 characters ten characters any characters just to ten characters no acceptance not more than 10 characters if you want the less than less than 10 characters this is a organic character data time and another one is another one is data type is also there where can infantry data type summary it can access to the character values character values other than the string foreign foreign right this is a okay data type and the combination of both characters and numbers not only characters not only numeric values both the combinations and next to the employee one more uh thing means it can accept alpha numeric value and this can eliminate the eliminate the added information added information Okay so non-parted comparison semantics means foreign foreign that means like this one character two character three character four five six seven eight nine ten character ten character space foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign this is uh back to the odd disc that is the most advantage of broadcast to data type 2 data types maximum size characters results become but uh can access to 2000 characters a day huge amount of data YouTube space 2000 characters we can enter only character values up to 255 characters only and the next uh unused we are using foreign [Music] foreign that determines by P and the after decimal how many digits we need to enter that it determines by yes okay the scale the scale write the scale alignment to the name you chase the number scale value right so this is about the Precision and scale and 820 right precision and scale tickets not only using director digits we can also enter some decimal values like decimal values means okay decimal values means like M15 4.5 4.5 sorry four five six point seven uh representation law in this representation 456 is a precision foreign that means 3 and 820 the Precision maximum three digits and one decimal and uh after decimal maximum two digits accepted Intel internet quantities [Music] maximum okay foreign H2 right this is if you want to enter value as a date format date format is [Music] foreign data type [Music] data type [Music] imaginary images images so then they okay data types okay character data type character data type and character data technology limitations and the integer values and Float values director and and uh year so right in this video we discussed about the data types and uh next batch an 8.3 next month uh already beginning of this video okay now I displayed the uh website and go through that website and enroll as soon as possible right thank you foreign foreign language and this SQL is used to manage the relational database management system relational relational relational database relational data base relational database SQL is used to manage the relational database database what is database so on next term what is the relational database and what is dbms and Equity Concepts right so sorry to maintain the relational database foreign collection of data database is an organized collection of data organized collection of data foreign that means organized means some operations are happened on data data I mean some operations apply this to know and some collection of data some collection of data stored one area that the area is called a database the huge amount of data stored in one area in your system server or whatever it may be the behavior is called a database but database to store the data storing the data why we need to store the data some data alignment is to analyze the business analysis analysis of the business foreign foreign I have a College I have a college um students information examination information and for the results information foreign foreign foreign foreign 2023 [Music] foreign 2020 for law okay now results and 820 the increase of volunteer eight decisions at the decision making an 8. depends on data County data and it went to the very most important thing so that kind of data is database there is no data if there is if there is no data if there is no data there is no business assume that is 2022 results under the there is no data means there is no business there is no business means there is no Revenue there is no Revenue means there is no profits and nothing is database is nothing but uh okay organized collection of data organized collection of data um to maintain the history history to generate the reports decisions decision making purpose and a depends on the organization depends on the organization okay some of the organizations maintain a choose amount of size of the database size of the database may be any size any size database size may be any size and complexity a size and it depends on the company depends on the user user requirements database size I have a only Supermarket just I'm using small scale database stores are there very multi stores database choose a database you just put the number but the data base alignment the size and then it depends on the organization simple some of the organizations using uh okay small scale database and some of the organizations using large database large database but a large database it may be okay servers or it may be terabytes okay so terabyte slow server slow data large database a large corporation and companies maintain a large database consisting of service terabytes of data on large mainframe computers [Music] decision making that is used for what purpose Sunday decision making decision making decisions for this purpose we are using data base database it may be any format it may be any format so until that means okay so it includes the data in the form of Text data text to data under text to format text format text format and the next term some numeric data and Advantage them to the numeric data text to data data in the form of voice data in the form of images data in the form of evangelism videos foreign right and the next two is data just data on 823 it's a rough Factor number useful information okay useful information is foreign started in the 1960s that the database name is called uh so IDs integrated data store integrated data store and 820 concept no first database first database very first database who started this first database who started this first database okay who started this first database started the okay first database that the database name is called integrated data store and uh it was developed in early 1960s 1960s slow a database history and 820 started and after that okay now by using a different uh intending Hardware components and different software components you Chester database foreign foreign [Music] database management system Software System Software System and that means to create to modify to retry to delete all kind of operations in all kind of operations are manage g620 okay systematic structure systematic way dbms database management system database management system is awesome and the next term some Securities alignment maintenance and also backup and Recovery purpose database dbms is nothing but to manage the database database software application software applications right dbms dbms software applications database management system foreign next to rdbms rdbms relational database management system relational database management system what is rdbm Method and a data in the form of relationship data and identity the relations system IC database management system particular data only in the form of tables tables so your dbms that means programming Concepts so those are basically a program that allows to create table element foreign [Music] foreign whatever it may be so in particular foreign domains one day it is language structured query language question different programming languages so like one of the programming language that is used for the some different application creation purpose and the C plus plus is the programming language that is the user to okay develop some applications and Java and python etc etc languages table is nothing but a combination of rows combination of rows and columns this is management is nothing but creations updations and uh deletions and uh rethriving of data data and it went to The Returned okay so a language SQL and 820 language operations okay this is about uh okay what exactly database and what exactly dbms or dbms and uh our regular concept is and next rdbms and database and 820 concept security just uh introduction and the next Stone and what exactly uh a day data types ND kind of operators exactly what uh what is database and what is dbms or dbms SQL concept right so next to my name is so batch uh Monday to Saturday classes and every day okay towards uh class flow [Music] foreign so thank you foreign in this webpage in having all the details of this batch okay SQL so um right so demo classes and next term some quotes or details on iPhone TV and next syllabus code syllabus okay in detailed information is there foreign foreign like how to create a tablet in our previous videos we discussed about what is SQL exactly and what is the importance of SQL and next to what is database and what is dbms and what is rdbms and the next term what are the data types in SQL and the next what are the operators in SQL connect 20 conceptional and next in this video in this video we are going to discuss about how to create a table in the SQL right how to create table in SQL creating table in SQL right table alignment okay I'm not using any more uh constraints constraints very simple table s right so for this purpose I am using one command that command is called create command create command foreign foreign statement is used to create a new table in your SQL create a table command is used to create a new table in your SQL a creator syntax foreign column 1 column one and a data type of the column data type of the column type of the column and size size of the column okay size of the column and next term column to Second column column two and the column to data type data type data type right and a size of T column size and dash dash dash dash and finally close the brace and use the semicolon and enter button so then table will created this is syntax how to create the table electronical person very simple syntax okay so is index Limited foreign create a table and the name of the table table name table name and the next some columns list column one and data type and size of the column okay any characters foreign foreign right so okay so this is your SQL prompt maybe SQL and 820 installation okay so gsql and 8.3 okay sub language yes and uh director I open the SQL prompt in this STL prompt in this SQL prompt I am creating a table okay so to create a table we are using Create command here create what I am creating here table creating table is creating table and the name of the table is a student is the name of the table and here some columns uh list that columns list like a student ID yes ID yes ID is a column and data type is a number number is a data type and here size alignment is mentioned yesterday and under that means this number this uh student ID can access to four digit number and a it may be less than four digitally enter J2 but uh not more than four digits not more than four digit we can enter just four digit number here and uh so this is one column and again I'm creating one more column student name yes name and student name column and a column data type which is any characters and the age of the student is number data type and age and 820 the industries two digit number under 99 maximum on a 99 so like this sir enough and uh number of columns go to maximum okay semicolon and press enter button here and uh what happened here already name is already existed and a student name already create ayundi create a unit from the name is already existed collectively changes no problem I'm a changing table name here and a table name or Jesse one three student one three and eight twenty three student one three and eight twenty three name changes right see here semicolon enter table created table created in my system in my database in my database table is created so um [Music] this is okay this is the table this is a table and here so yes ID yes ID and yes name and age and 820 like this expectation but um so yes ID S ID and uh yes main yes Main and H H like this is foreign foreign the pin is created as a table because it on the table and 820 name today okay student 13 and 820 table create a Hindi selected command select to start from next to any command data you Channel student 13 student 13. foreign foreign foreign declare okay insert a insert insert into inserted into the engine inserted into table name okay yes table name table name and the a field low key data yes to now okay field fill the name field name internally yes ID field and uh yes name field yes name field and the next term field and the next two values and 820 keyword this is foreign 13. student right and a column list column list insert into insert into okay table name table table name table underscore name table underscore name and a column list column list column list column list and the next under list of the columns and values and 820 keyword values and the next term okay like values list values Lister values list 18 okay values list so finally semicolon enter so today create a insert into table name insert into is a command name here insert into is a command name and the table name table name name of the table name of the table column list 20 and next values listed values list these are the values these are the values like this foreign and uh and uh and uh some column list age of the age age values okay what values we are using what values one zero zero one is the name of the ID of the student student ID either in single quotation for a single quotation and this is the characters characters enclosed with the single quotation by the age of these student is 28 and uh semicolon right enter button one row created same command again same command insert into table name and a column list values 102 and Japan ramu and the next H is uh 24 whatever it may be semicolon enter enter right so semicolon enter what happened here so some syntactical error here semicolon and enter button so next row 180 degree create time next row created right and one more row is creating me and the next uh one zero three is a student and Ravi is a name of the student Ravi is the name of the student his age is 26 like this semicolon enter so raw created this is a way of creating rows way of creating rows and now now see those rows are created in table or not summer table create in the data an identity tables select star select the star from select to star from student Earth and this is the table you put me two tables selected no rows are selected no rows selected challenge okay and uh yes this one is a record of 101 student this is a record of 102 student this is a record of 103 students names tuples right this is a way of creating and the installation how to install and next how to create a user and how to connect it to SQL and how to give permissions to SQL to create all these things right so this is the way of creating and inserting data in table okay so the creation and uh to create a table what command we require create table command create table command and uh to insert the data insect into insert into statement insert into statement create memo create a table alignment statement to use yes and the table name table name and column list and values values is a keyword and values list with the semicolon right and this is about way of creating and inserting data into table okay so next new batch an 823 next month start yes for that purpose here's one website is there pythonlife dot in Oracle dot HTML so Oracle new badge SQL new batch started in next month and uh so see all the things in the website and go for enroll option here right thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so SQL new batch next month launches so you still batch questions that website is called python like dot in oracle.html and open to the website are there and the next term okay so a bachelor name and some video classes [Music] right so when a previous video in our previous video how to create a table and how to create how to create okay how to insert the data an advantage conception how to create and how to insert the data in table how to create table in SQL foreign foreign language data query language so next how to select data from a table on 829 data retrieval languages table select statement select the command selector selecting the data from table foreign [Music] foreign all right selecting data from selecting data under data and it went to the integrator that is selector distinct or unique column names student 13 is a table name in this student 13 here student ID is there and the student name is their student age is there this is the okay table we created in a previous video right and this table name is called Evan Japan student okay student 13 and 8 23 table name student 13 student 13 is the table name right so yes ID is a field I name foreign [Music] foreign foreign semicolon okay select okay select column list column okay column list column foreign enter foreign display okay student 13 student uh table so this star indicates this star indicates all columns in your table all columns in tablet star indicates all columns in your table columnist means what any column list means what do you want exactly I want just the student ID student age say this one how to display the data okay so here I am sharing SQL prompt SQL prompt this is SQL prompt in SQL prompt say our table what is our table here so student 13 is our table okay now okay sorry you know what tables are there in my end login set selector okay select the star from select to star from tab tab all the tables in my login earlier in my user here I have a table that the table is called a student 13 student 13 and um also are they but in my previous videos all records are from this table from select the star from enter the select the star from select the star from student 13. student 13 semicolon enter right total data is the displayed or not about the student 13. star indicates a star indicates here star indicates star indicates all columns in table from student 13 student student 13 student 13 is a table student to 13 semicolon enter enter yes only student 13 student ID is displayed here only student ID only student ID is displayed here all columns yesterday right so this is a way of and one more thing okay yes ID yes ID comma age age of T student from economic from student student 13 from student 13 semicolon and right so it will make end display in the student a IDs and age 101 student having 28 years of age and 102 student having 24 years of age and 103 students having 26 age so I want uh name and the age of the student name and the age of the student select uh name yes name yes name comma is name comma age age of the student from chandi from from student 30 in student 13 from student to 13 semicolon and right this is a bayafa or cannot displaying data from a camera from table table launching data display not only using this one only from class and it has some conditions conditions okay how to use conditions here where age is greater than 25 H is greater than H is greater than H is greater than 25. so we're putting it on the under the student's age who are having more than 25 those students are displayed from your table see here semicolon enter semicolon enter because select the yes name and age from the student to the team where age is greater than uh where H is greater than 25. this 25 is okay this 28 is greater than 25 this 20 8 is greater than greater than 25 is greater than 25 conditions and an extra 26 is greater than 25 26 is greater than 25 so 28 and 26 and 820 records are displayed outside okay now 28 and 26 records a day whatever the condition mentioned here so our conditions this is a way of retrieving data from okay data from table table system find some sub queries we can retrace the data data selected right and uh okay you could have different conditions different different conditions and as per your requirement as per user requirement yesterday from class law okay where conditions select the star from select to star from Okana select to Star front student select to start from student to 13 student to 13 and aware condition where condition where conditions a is a edge is less than 25 H is less than 25. the student ages who are having less than 25 those students are displayed here the students who are having less than 25 less than 25 120 students information ID student name and age less than 25 less than 25 or 24 is less than 25 or not in our regular class we are applying different conditions and also we can use the some giant conditions at the data and advantages not only are displaying from one table we can use multiple tables right and uh this is very simple concept of retriving data from table so okay and the next month SQL new batch and explain to the name start yes in oracle.html connected website UTC you can enroll in okay new badge thank you thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so SQL new batch next month so a bachelor okay website in this website so okay yes indeed course syllabus NT and the next term so what kind of projects we are offering foreign foreign foreign working with the ddl commands what does that mean sir how exactly the real commands are working in previous uh previous videos how to create a table and the next term how to insert the data into table and the next how to retrieve data from table table before that how to create a table and next to how to insert the data into table and 8. right in this video so what is ddl comments and how to use those ddl commands okay so a video comments that means here by using the real commands so ddl means data definition language data definition language so it had a ddl abbreviated as Evangel data definition data definition data definition language data definition language data definition language so by using this data definition language here those are those comments are create command create an 820 Main important commanded this one create and the next Stone altar alter alter and next tone drop alter drop and next to truncate truncate and the next rename rename commands data definition language data definition language it is one of the SQL sub language foreign language create command is there altern command is the drop command is the truncate and rename and 820 commencement by using Create command by using Create command so we can create the object in SQL create an object an object on in SQL an object object object in SQL SQL or legendary database database database view or it may be user user or it may be procedure or it may be Trigger or it may be cursor whatever it may be either objects create an 820 commandering you chest uh how to create a table by using Create command created create create table increases if you want to create a table table is a keyword if you want to create view view is a keyword if you want to create user user is a keyword here [Music] column name column one column one and data type of the data type of the column and the size of the column size of the column this is a way of creating a column in table and next to one more column here and the data type data type of the column data type of the column and the size of the column size size of the column and dash dash dash dash dash dash dash l number of columns are 8. finally close the price no close chest to know and determinate with the semicolon this is a way of creating table table creation so simple table of creative very simple table so in the table okay create a create a table create a table create a table table name product is a table name product is a table line and here okay so some column names in the product and the product every product having ID product ID algorithm that the ID represented with the number data type find that the number size are open to the maximum okay four digit number enter yes whatever it may be okay now size are it depends on your okay depends on okay requirements right and next product name p name product name product name product to name even if the numbers three digit number whatever it may be whatever it may be and semicolon semicolon right this is a way of creating table in number okay database create Commandments to create a table to create a view to create a user to create a database to create a trigger to create a procedure to create a cursor objects remember that so let's see this one in practically okay now how to create a table in a foreign foreign so I'm opening a SQL prompt here this is your SQL prompt in this SQL prompt I am creating product table create table create a table and the table name is product table name is product and here so in this table P ID product ID number data type number data type of size okay four and next comma and the next free name P name okay and the next comma internet price price and the number data type and the semicolon enter semicolon enter see table what happened product table is already there in my a user already is there product table is there so that's why name is already used an existing object they already used okay now this name is already used right so I'm changing this uh name here so name changes name on 820 product 13 product to 13 and next see here table created table created product table is created table created to create a table what command we are using what command we are using here so create a table commandering you just now right okay for this one okay and the next two degrees after this one okay to create a table we have a create table command is there create command table is there and uh to alter this table to alter this table under that means constraints scanning is product ID is a product name is a and product price previous videos and so here see here so zero zero one and a product name is a product name is a product name and this price is uh just a 250 rupees 250 250 and next I am using one more row okay I am inserting one more row here and uh product uh ID is z002 and the name of the product is uh something a local team like and uh this product price is uh 350 as in that and a rho is created see here selector select select the star from select retriving data select the star from enter the product product 13 product 13 Select Staff from product to 13. see here write three product table the employee data and advantages my requirement is I need to add one more column to this yesterday alter command alter command add so see here I am writing this one alter alter alter size all right this is a way of altering table all right okay let's see practically let's see practically so here here already we have a table in this table product ID is a product name is there and product price is there I want to add one more column to this uh product table So eventually alter an 820 commands alter command alter then alteration table alternate alter table table name of Jesse product table product 13 is a table name and next add an 820 column you just uh yes customer ID customer ID number data type number data type and next four is the size whatever it may be right semicolon enter yeah table altered or not table altered table altered here right and the next term selector select the select the star select the star from select to star from M15 product table product table product 13 product 13 semicolon enter right here one more column is added one more column is added one more column is added in this video in this video we discussed about ddl commands ddl commands are used to create a physical structure to create a physical structure are related to modify the physical structure to drop the physical structure is there command and the remaining drop in the truncate command will see in next video right so thank you one another and uh we are starting new batch in uh okay now next next month so to enroll to enroll the two new badge here use the enroll loud option okay now thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so foreign life Dot oracle.html Network website so e website yes and this match is very uh basic to Advanced very basic to Advanced the SQL and Advantage with the support of Oracle okay maximum utilize dispatch and uh next coming to in this video I would like to discuss about ddl commands here ddl commands ddl is abbreviated as a data definition language command data definition language so in this data definition we have a comments like create alter drop truncate or rename comments are there in data definition language so already in the previous video we discussed about the create command alter command today how exactly create the table by using Create command and how to modify the structure of the table you're going to create command and you chase good afternoon how to how to add the column to existing table how to add the column to existing table okay table code existing table go column is slow we can see okay how to add the constraints how to drop the constraints and how to change the data type of the column so all the all these things using alter command alter commandment [Music] regular classes and the next coming to drop command drop command white drop command is using here foreign [Music] table entire table and Adventures truncate command is used to okay truncate command command is used to use to delete them delete total rows total rows from the table table all records all rows total rows all rows Rosary delete table structure is existed table table structure okay table structure is existed is existed table structure is existed foreign table structure and advantages and the next coming to Arena means to change the name rename rename table old name old name and the next term new name older name to internet new name new name new name is foreign foreign table and a table name alter table table name alter table table name rename two okay alter table table name table name alter table table name rename rename to how Hitler rename rename and two rename name this is old name evolved name evolved name right so this old name this folder name change to this new name and semicolon enter semicolon name is old name that old name is renamed to new name this old name is this old name is rename 2 rename to rename new name this is a way of altering the table so create order drop truncate rename so if we need your comments foreign okay just p r o d p r o d product prod less than the product to 12 product 12. productive 12 semicolon enter right table drain altered see here table altered in Islam alter table table name uh product 13 and rename to MN products a product of 13 and 820 table and a product of twilga change the name and Advantage is selector foreign tab select star from tab see in the previous video right someone came in the product uh 12 is the product 1320 the event and the productivity changes name on 820 so it is star star indicates all columns from M15 product query okay select a star from product uh same data okay just a table name changes foreign to start from product product 13 product 13 semicolon enter see here product of 13 table or view does not exist but 13 and 820 delayed generally 13 20 names is this is a way of changing okay table name one table name to another table name an 820 change it and at the same time we can change the column names also those can be okay see in our regular class right so I'll next one which is the entire records in your table table laundered when they record snow at eight times without using wear condition a daytime if we want to delete all records from table all records from table yesterday so see here truncated table table name foreign records two lakhs records without uh asking any occurrence see here table truncated so table truncated table truncated that means the table is a table only 20 data is deleted select to start from select to start from product 12 product 12 semicolon enter right no rows selected no rows selected no rows selected right it will an 8 20 tables error message it is selected right so this is way of deleting records from the table but a particular table structure yes to check the structure d e s c description of the table or table name empty product uh into values okay values and in this values one zero zero three and the next term or record the name is a student name is like naresh and the next student and product the product name is notebook notebook okay notebook and the next price of the notebook okay 45 rupees 45 rupees customer customer ID is a double 201 enter right see here one row one row created and a select star from selector star select the star from mm product table product 12 product 12 semicolon enter see here okay they will eat result selected but the table structure available structure including data foreign name so drop table then it drops product foreign foreign not available select select to star from select the star from okay select the star from product 12 semicolon enter see table or view does not exist I said no okay okay here in the table or view does not exist an advantage socks are descriptions foreign right okay so on ddl commands create command is there alter command is there drop command is there truncate command rename command so very basic level of how to use these commands on adventures right and obviously a translation and between uh one of the tasks right and uh this batch is going to start in next month of next month is and beret online classes available hello everyone welcome to SQL SQL new batch next month start yesterday python life dot in oracle.html sorry website foreign that means so how to enroll and how to watch the demo classes and external code so details and the courses syllabus and uh remaining details are open to be good clear visible technique you can enroll to s2l new batch the batch will start on next month right so in this video in this video okay we are going to discuss about DML commands DML commands so in our previous video in our previous video we discussed about ddl commands ddl commands data definition language commands in our previous video create alter drop truncate rename management DML commands that means of data manipulation language commands data manipulation and that means these commands can perform on top of the data on table foreign if you want to create a new structure we can go for ddl commands if you want to modify the structure we can go for ddl commands but if you want to change the data in existing table already table is there in that some data is there now you want to change that data want to delete the data so updated commands ddl commands ddl commands so first okay table structure want to insert them insert a new if you want to update the data update update update the data so we are going to discuss about update command and finally you don't want the record you don't want to records in your table then you can go for delete the record delete to the record record s DML commands update and delete the 820 commands with you JC my name is if you want to change the data data changed and first of all here want to insert a new record inserting inserting new record new record new record new row or recorder into the into the into the table into the table insert insert into an 8.3 insert into table name already table and it went to the graduation term or table name is table name and the next stone column list column three column three foreign value one comma value to Value to comma value 3 value 3 okay number of values after the N number of columns this is the way of inserting data into table and then to two more uh methods are also there to insert the data those will be see in our regular classes okay so in this simple method this is a very simple method how to insert data insert into table name and column list and the next values are equal to the keyword this good to know okay and the next one value one value two value three up to dash dash n number of columns you just among that many number of values all right okay sorry see here SQL prompt is that and in this SQL prompt so okay table alignment is new table okay one new table and 823 Edition create a table table names create a table table name person and in this person table this person table having person ID every person having ID and the person name p name and age of the person age age person ID and data type number data type already concept and Advantage how to create table connect with the previous video I think so Victory Engineers whatever it may be okay and next to P name person name person name and next uh age of the person age of the person number and this number data type is two like this like this and the semicolon enter right table created here foreign ID P name pidp name right and values values values and the next one zero one and the name of the person is [Music] 30 years and a semicolon enter right record inserted already in previous classes and one more record here one more record one more record and uh same thing insert insert into insert into same same thing same thing okay name of the person okay whatever it may be and age is uh okay like 28 whatever it may be okay semicolon enter semicolon enter and the next one more record one more record and the next episode three okay and next to ramu ramu write ramu and age is 26. 26 right and one more record and uh yes foreign foreign right see and how the data is created here and then questions and how to select a data uh in different different ways now right select uh select star from select to star from mnum select star from okay table name table name is a person table name is person semicolon enter see see the data here this is the date this is the data so only how to insert the data how to insert the data into table table okay data apply insertation and insertation select star star indicates all columns in table and replace number Select the star from okay table name table name is person and this is a way of inserting data into table and the next two how to update the data is there by using update command we can change the data in table table modification um [Music] update is the statement update is a statement table name table name update to table name table name set is a keyword here set and uh they need changes right column name column name column name equal to column name equal to Value column name equal to values foreign see here and uh next to go to SQL prompt here SQL prompt and in this ticket already table is there and E tables set column area already 26 is there 26 is there but today is zero three foreign person select to start from person semicolon enter what happened here oh no space is there selector start select the star from select to star from from person is a table name semicolon enter see see the age of theorem age of T ramu is 20 changed or not because age is 26 or not right this is a way of changing the record update the value okay I want to change updates update 25 since 25 semicolon enter right see all records are run changed as a 25. wear conditions right and next law how to and the advanced level of update next to regular class but uh you could adjust very basically and the next coming to next one uh deleting the record delete the record how to delete the record one more command ad one more command delete command already we discussed about the insert we discussed about update and finally delete command is there and how to delete the record from a table and I want it delete command is used to delete the record from table and Japan so syntax delete delete delete table name delete table name table name table name is person okay table name is foreign foreign so our Ricardo delicious delete okay delete record [Music] from delete from any table name table name person delete from person what will happen here total records and advantages where exactly everyone p i d p i d equals to to P ID equals to two if it is the person who are having ID equals to not to one zero two sorry one zero two one zero two the person IDE who are having 102 that record is going to delete now semicolon enter see and the next right one row deleted one row deleted from a table selector select the star from select to start from person selector start from person semicolon enter see recorded deleted or not recorded deleted from entering this table person table percentage okay total records now and uh delete delete delete from person like this also we can delete the entire records semicolon enter three rows deleted or not now selected the table no row selected select the star from select the star from image person semicolon enter no row selected right this is a way of deleting particular physical structure unable to the available name is person table name is person right so table structure is available right these are the DML commands DML commands so DML commands are used to manipulate the data in River table but those are insert recommend insert a command and insert the command update command delete command and how to use these commands and identity syntax sentence right so delete from sticker delete some person right this is a way of inserting updating deleting and also some more Advanced things in these Concepts those will see in the okay in our regular class so a regular class cosum um next you can enroll and continue the quotes and then you may success right thank you thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so next month SQL new batches foreign foreign language teaching and duration and fee details and batch timings and course syllabus what we are completely covering in this course in detailed information is there and uh so what a nickname okay next turn go for enroll right so in this video I am going to explain about operators in operators in SQL operators in previous video in previous video we discussed about we discussed about data types in SQL and 820 concept to know and uh operators operators SQL in SQL SQL right so what is an operator what is an operator first operator means and the next term what type of operators are there and advantages operator okay operator is a special character operator is a special characters operator is the special character operator represented by keywords keywords no operator by using operators what we can do by using operators what we can do right so it operated we can perform operations on operands we can perform operations on operands operands operations write an operator manipulates an operator manipulates individual data items and uh or written see a result foreign [Music] [Music] plus is the operator you place an element of the India is right this is a way of using operators an operator manipulates individual data items and the retention result [Music] that means employee salary foreign not only calculating this kind of values and also change the field values employee table employees for example here employee table is there this is an employee table assume that so here employee okay employee name and employee salary and employee salary and I20 fields are there so name of the employee and the salary of the employee name and salary name name of the employee and the next salary of the employee salary the salary of the employee so name an 820 it may be employee name for example okay this employee getting a salary for example fifteen thousand assume that fifteen thousand fifteen thousand and next to one more person is there and ramu management employee and this person getting uh 20 000 salary 20 000 salaries twenty thousand salary is salary plus uh 500 stocks fifteen thousand five hundred twenty thousand five hundred and eight twenty the change out only and then to change this kind of uh to change this kind of data so when I'm waiting operated not only using not only using additional and also we can subtract the data and also we can okay subtract the data and also we can divide the data like different uh different or different operate operations what type of operators are they okay so operators some operators like okay these are the types of operators types of operators automatic operators relational operators comparison operators logical operators logical operators some relational operators means what relational operators and then automatic operators so automatic operators took multiplication and a division division Division and next to modulus modulus e operations automatic operators are used to manipulate the automatic operations used to perform the arithmetic operations those arithmetic operations it may be addition it may be subtraction and it may be multiplication and it may be Division and it may be modulus mod an identity operator so our addition addition addition is used to add the two fields to Fields [Music] subtraction subtracting data from one field to another field from one field to another Field located okay multiplication that means uh multiply the two values are less than 10 multiply the two field field these are the fields these are the fields so P Fields unequality but multiply chair and cosum multiply Channel multiplication and a division operation and one value is divided with the another value at the time it gives the result as a coefficient coefficient alignment the result is foreign to compare the two values to compare the two values and then that means a equals to some value a equals to uh right b equals to some 20 and 820 this is good to know now what is the relationship between these two values and it may be what kind of relation is there in between these two a day it may be a greater than b a greater than b or less than a a is less than b a is less than b and the next term a is operator like this foreign what kind of what kind of relation is there what kind of relation is there okay what kind of a relation is there not equal not equal to B not equal to B two operands what kind of relation is there it may be greater than or it may be less than or it may be greater than or equals to or it may be less than or equals to or equal or not equal if it is true okay it returns a true and if it is false it returns false false true or false and 820 what name you just relational operators What relation is there in the occurrence operators and the next coming to next one next one comparison operators comparison relational operators keywords okay r r and percentile and advantages it may be any character any character he could underscore means any character any character and again third and eight one to the r and next to remaining and 820p remaining remaining characters comparison operators comparison operations [Music] foreign foreign there is no value there is no value it is not equal to zero it is not equal to Infinity it is not equal to any value a value equals to know right this is about the comparison operators these are the comparison operators okay like 23 between an 820 is and the next coming to logical operators Marine logical operators logical operators operator and next logical or operator and logical not operator on 821 relational operators just you compared the compare the two variables two variables then B and uh a greater than or equals to a less than R equals to a equal to B A naught equals to B and the economically every 10 e operated and just nine just two values tonight only [Music] out on the foreign and the next two are operator R operators any one condition any one condition anyone any one condition just one condition one condition one condition and 820 through it it returns true true okay it returns true if any one condition is true it returns true all conditions 99 conditions and 820p false signing foreign false false false written yes if condition is false if condition is true a return sir returns true returns true condition True by the false returns so this is about the logical logical operators logical operators so logical operators R operator not operator this is true it returns a true otherwise it returns false and not operator conditions right this is about the operators in SQL unequality topic right and then printing in detailed examples how to use these things okay this is about the operators in SQL right so SQL batch and it went to the next month start yesterday and the beginning of the video okay that Islam and uh website law complete the course details are there course details are there so our course details right thank you thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so SQL new batch and 820 the next two months so website is called uh uh python life dot in oracle.html enactment to the website so foreign [Music] right okay right in this video okay now we are going to discuss about Integrity constraints Integrity constraints already in our previous videos we discussed a lot of things we discussed a lot of things so that means we discussed the ddl comments and the DML commands and TCL commands by using ddl commands how to create a table table alignment create chart okay summary table log create Json data yes foreign so we are restricting the restricting the data data restricted for example student ID column and I20 this column student ID column connected this is no it is not a possible students foreign foreign constraint is nothing but the rule rules those rules can be applied on the type of table in a type of data in a table winner apply yes or no but then what type of data you need to store in your table need table or a type of data but a type of data foreign number of types of constraints are there it may be not null constraint constraint unique constraint unique constraint and the next primary key constraint primary key primary primary primary key constraint primary key and also some constraints are there like foreign key foreign default constraint is there and the next one check constraint check constraint and a default constraint default constraint like this constraints and a unique constraint foreign right so coming to first one National constraint not null and unique and primary key so those will see in the okay in a regular classes not in this video so just I am how to apply National constraint and how to apply unique constraints table student table student and at this table having some attributes those are student ID those are student ID student name and age age and 820 columns in this student ID yes ID student ID and the next term student name yes name yes name is a field and age is a field age is a field is here and uh one zero one and the person name is called uh name and that name is like this and the next age of the person 26 26 right 26 and the next one zero two is a person ID student ID find the name of the student BBB like this and next age of the student is 24 24 right 24 okay 24 and the next two weeks again 26. possible or not without the rule number without rule number 20 percent and the next turn even this age is 22 whatever it may be so see here here no ID there is no ID for the student but students no it is not possible okay every student having every student must have the roll number that the rule number eight laundering not to duplicate this is the duplicate and the 101 is assigned to one student and same rule number not assign it to another student and students it is inconsistent data it is inconsistent data see here even internal here roll number one zero one is assigned to a a person and the same rule number is assigned to C person that D person does not have any roll number any rule number it is inconsistent data it is inconsistent data to eliminate this kind of inconsistency we are using Integrity constraints to eliminate to eliminate inconsistency to eliminate inconsistency we are using Integrity constraints Integrity color strains one of the Integrity constraints that means this kind of nulls or the name of Nepali here null is nothing but uh undefined value unknown value absent of value it is not equal to zero and uh it is not equal to Infinity just it is a displaced as a space but it is not equal to space space but it is not equal to space it is not equal to zero it is not equal to not equal to okay Infinity is duplicate data data redundancy Alex is selector selector is there already records are there records are there Marie records sir so a table or descriptions description of a person person description of person semicolon enter and there is no constraints because foreign values values values of payment eponym values of values of ND 1 0 2 1 0 2 comma and the next uh and the next is 26 whatever it may be and the semicolon enter so record inserted record created here record created so I am selecting same data select select to star from selector star from enter the person and see here 102 is inserted there one zero two record is there record is there and the next two is the same one zero one and eight one day recorder again I am inserting so one zero one one zero one nine eight twenty that is and age is 26. so it is accepted row is accepted at a duplicate duplicates there one zero one is naresh and children without giving roll number also rule number is foreign foreign name of the person name of the person is name of the person is a Albany and the next term age of the person is a 26 like this semicolon enter sorry is stored in a person name and age is 26 is stored in age column and what we skipped here person ID skip button is see see row created while the selector table here okay created and the 26 is the age use the unique constraint summary Edition foreign foreign number okay three and student ID3 and yes name student name we are here to offer 10 and next student age age foreign [Music] foreign ID should not be accepted null value student ID should not be accepted null value see here and finally create the table table created what happened here not null right parenthesis that means not null space required here space required not null name student 13 is already is there student 13 is already is there so I am changing number student in 2014 Student to 14 so see here table created ID should not be accepted null values foreign student to 14 student to 14 so here I am using Dynamic representation values values like ampersand Ampersand Ampersand Sid Ampersand S ID under a dynamic values student name character typography and percent of yes name and next and age of the student Ampersand of age this is a another way of inserting data into table right so enter student ID created [Music] one row created and the next term one more record one more recorded create one zero two one zero two and the name of the person ramu name of the person ramu and the age of the person is 22 right procreated so and again forward slash and enter now enter value for a student ID and the input student ID is Ravi and the age of Jesse 24 right cannot insert the inter cannot insert null into skirt and 820 user student 14 table law student ID Sid and Advantage student 14 table a user Scott user law Scotty user law student 14 law okay yes ID and 820 columns accepted it cannot be accepted it cannot be accepted very clear information is there cannot insert a null into ekkada user law student 14 table low so yes no [Music] okay right so Ravi Ravi Ravi is a name of the person and age is uh whatever it may be 25. yes procreated say selector select select a star from student 14. semicolon enter see here nulls are not going to be accepted but the duplicates aligned to be accepted here duplicate accepted duplicate accepted yesterday create a table create a table and a table name foreign [Music] foreign student to 15 student 15 and in this table yes ID number data type number data type so in this number data type 3 unique unique constraint unique constraint summary unique constraints this kind of duplication and it went to the eliminate this Sunday but null value 180 exceptions and the next term yes name test name of 10 worker 2 of 10 and the next term h h number data type age number data type of enter see table created check here descriptions student 14 student to 14 and student to 14 other students 15 student to 15 semicolon enter right so description below there is no here so table description under student ID number data type is number data type now insert the data into this table foreign values values of amp percent of yes ID comma and name and equal to the character got a single quotation yes name and a single quotation clause and the next term Ampersand of age of this potential like this semicolon enter now I am entering 1 0 1 and the name of the student is same nourish and the next age of the person is 28 like this row created and again one more row I'm creating 1 0 2 1 0 2 and the next term name of the person Ravi Ravi and the age is 24. right Pro created say here I am using um one zero two again one zero two and the name is ramu ramu and uh 26 is the H enter see here again error already inserted again Wireless foreign see the data and select star from star from them right okay student 15 student to 15 right so 1 0 1 1 0 2 is unique right so okay insert into right sort table insert student ID null null and a student name Ram student name from and the next one age age 22. see here they will create it they will create a select a star from select the star from student 15 student to 15 semicolon enter right so I'll type a unique constraints foreign [Music] and uh internet duplicate data so in a regular video in regular classes in regular classes and how to use primary key foreign and also multiple constraints in single table singular column next to regular class law to the so next to batch unite quantity next month startup only so that is HTTP colon forward slashes pythonlife dot in slash oracle.html and Advantage website name you can enroll you can enroll for the batch in the comments right so right so use this patch very in detailed information available SQL and the next six days plus SQL six hours SQL towards like SQL and you're pressing just how to create how to insert and how to update not this much of a stuff foreign batch utilize this uh website okay next month launches right thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so SQL news python dot python life python life Dot oracle.html so and uh if you want to watch a demo use this website and about this class about this SQL codes every details are available here so watch this uh details thoroughly and enroll in SQL batch so Bachelor total codes uh duration 45 days syllabus is there and next batch timing Senate 26 2 8 o'clock and two hours every day two hours from Monday to Saturday and in this two hours and we will cover so SQL codes content and the next practical session and down to sessions foreign use that website and enroll in a SQL badge right so particularly videos in our previous videos we discussed about introduction to SQL so under the difference between uh dbms rdbms and what exactly database and what are the data types in database Oracle and what are the operators in Oracle and what are the ddl comments DML comments all those things we discussed in our previous videos and next how to create SQL and how to create a table how to create a table how to insert the data into table how to retrace that data from table and next how to modify the structure of the table all those things we discussed in our previous videos but in this video in this video we are going to discuss about functions in SQL functions in SQL what executive function function so function is nothing but the set of SQL statements function is nothing but the set of SQL statements to perform a specific task so functions set of SQL task SQL statements skill statements no okay set of skill statements no functional definition foreign foreign means a set of fiscal statements are to perform a specific task is nothing but a function but function access to the input as a parameter is saying based on the input foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] then is assigned to a underneath the functions assign it to this a and this 20 is assigned to this B and finally it returns a 10 plus 20 that means 30 30 and 823 is assigned to this is the that value is assigned to the C and Japan foreign okay value from input is received and perform action action and equal to the performance this is a way of declaring function in a different programming languages same as accepted input as the committed and the perform action and then okay return the result so so arguments uh an argument it can be mine okay Okay so um user supplied content that means the argument it may be constant or it may be variable value either Nokia variable value other than the column value column value otherwise see the general syntax of a function very simple syntax here right so this is a syntax a function see name of the function name of the function and the next column name expression whatever it may be I think maximum ages column Value Place expression YouTube right this is about the function very simple function but he functions and it may be function Maybe okay so function can appear in function can appear in function can appear in right in different places in different places function can appear in uh functions can appear in selected list select list where list other than the where class other than started with the class ES so Implement a different term classes slow function management accordingly select the list and start with the class but the director functions connected by class different area slow function management remember that and the next term okay these functions may be used in selected where class or group by class also or less can be used in nested tables that means a table within the table is called nested tables can be used in select function can be used in their class function can be used in order by class and also the nested functions functions used in a nested tables also right but what types of functions available are available what types of functions are available in uh SQL so here different types of functions available so those are uh okay character function that means character function means so these types of functions can accept the input as a character value character function means what any character functions means character function accept the input as a character and it returns a character and number both a both the character maximum character and equipment those functions are character functions sometimes these functions can accept the input as a numerical value number value and also it returns character other than take it returns a number character function can accept both character and number and also it returns a character kind of number character and number so character functions character functions right and the next term and uh some more functions are they number functions number functions very number functions these number functions so this number functions are accepted input as a numerical value and a returns a output as a numerical value accept the numeric input and written and after processing this pump function with the written a numeric value it written numeric value accepted the numeric as a input and I accepted numeric value as an input and the retina numeric values and the written numeric values so this is called a number functions number functions right so any number functions undefined yes to know next thing even my functions and 8.3 date functions important thing date functions that means so these functions operated on dates functions operate on values of the date data type data data type and that means format DD mm YY format DD mm by format so data data type Mina functions so a format DB until day of the week mm month of the year and next year number so that is called Date functions and finally we get a functions conversion functions are also there functions so conversion functions in yesterday converting from one data type to another data type convert a value from one data type to another data type that means character can be converted into numeric numeric can be converted into okay character types and functions so simple foreign foreign class select a list and the next uh where class their class and next term order by class like this different areas foreign character functions these character functions can accept both the character and the number as a input and also it returns both the characters and the number as a output and the number functions those number of functions you can accept a input as a numerical value and a returns are returns numeric as a output and the date functions these date functions can operate on data data type data data type winner date functions and the conversion functions those functions are can convert one data type two another data type Leica character 2 numeric numeric to characters let's say all these things as a practically all right here I am discussing about the summer character functions character functions practical how character functions are executed character function character functions right so character functions character functions lower that means what lawyer lower the one of the character functions expression column or expression whatever it may be lower character functions what it can do what it can do it converts the Alpha character value into lower case Alpha character value into lower case lower case is that the character converted into lower case okay this converter this converter it converts Alpha character value to lower case foreign [Music] Instagram those characters are converted into lower case lower case character functions character functions see here and uh let's see these things as a practically here practically so I'm sharing SQL prompt to you SQL prompt so here in this SQL prompt and selecting select select either okay select lower of select to lower lower character function here like Oracle and entered uppercase letters and that is enclosed in single quotation because they all are characters characters enclosed in a single quotation foreign [Music] DL is a dummy table so that is used to perform some general actions General actions and a that the data not resides database if it is not available only semicolon see here semicolon enter semicolon enter right semicolon enter see okay it can even install uppercase letter sentence function lower function converted these uppercase letters into lower case Okay so this is one nothing character function and also we can convert uppercase letters into lower case uppercase letters [Music] characters what I can write see here from D L and J select the upper of function in the neckline upper 180 function so Danny conversation and the statement equals right so this is the conversion function again character function converting one case to another case uppercase uppercase lowercase like this okay regular class schedule at the next numerical functions numeric functions and the include character function slow you get different kind of functions and that means each character is and concatenate function that means connecting a okay different the column values together are less than 10 to different statements can get some material functions and like the substring and it went to the in string and it went to be okay different testing functions those will be see in our regular class and the next stone is mathematical functions mathematical functions number functions okay so next thing we just say internet number functions number functions mathematical functions foreign [Music] these functions accept the number as inputs and written number as output or limited numerical values number input and written numeric values and Epsilon numeric values these functions are called a mathematical functions in a number of functions number functions right and number e functions a moment foreign function rounding function right round function and the India cell round function and the value and it went to the round objects and the new value and infinity if the value is in a decimal points decimal points and our decimal points and 821 name integer low key and without a decimal logic conversation so round of M comma can so you put it in English only round off 5.678 round of 678 and 8.3 okay okay foreign [Music] foreign right selector whatever it may be is so let's see in practically select select even five point five point seven eight six seven eight six seven eight six comma okay number foreign seven eight six okay number two number two it is rounded foreign enter see here Five Point uh seven eight six seven integer values converting so eating money because now display time input value one eight one to the immigration number value you just know number value and next to same thing children selector post integer value 180 the display end select mm 5.5.432 four three two the name same thing number round and eight point the function here and the next term 5.5432 5.432 okay either rounded value rounded value rounded value from a current chain from Dual energy see okay rounded points [Music] and it is not a richer 50 percent if it is 50 percent it goes to nearest integer value six if it is less than 60 percent Now 50 percent sorry fifty percent it goes to okay bottom that means this value okay this is a way of using number functions number functions number of number functions available are they and uh like a truncated the floor and 820 modulus square root absolute sine foreign foreign [Music] arrangement date function date function now data format Oracle stores dates in an internal numeric format but format is called a intending this is the format of date right so DDM by y d d m m y y is the date format d d m m by y subscribe function says date function remember that function important function since date functions State function foreign [Music] date select this plate from from DN from DL semicolon enter semicolon enter see what is date today and a summary 27 June 2023 whatever it may be system current date and time pick a time and this is a way of displaying system date and the e-system date and 820 function ugc you can add date you can subtract date you can okay now do any operation by using this date function important function and then add underscore monthly 20 function [Music] months underscore between an 820 function you just some next underscore day and 820 functions last underscore day and uh rounding dates truncating dates under summer data operations those will perform on your regular session functions an identity concept some conversion functions conversion functions these conversion functions are okay one data type two converting one data type to another data type converting one data type to another data type is called a conversion functions that we'll see in our regular session this is just for demo okay very clear information there is not from direct Advanced things and basic level Network very pinpoint from description right this is about the just functions very basic level and the name functions foreign so for that purpose use pythonlife dot in okay slash Oracle dot HTML something website and this website available bottom of this video use that website and watch this website the thoroughly observe this website and check every details and don't believe SQL in one one day one hour and two Awards not like that here we are providing full codes in 45 days in this duration we are discussing information in detail and the different types same information multiple types in this uh okay basic to Advanced SQL with the Oracle and 820 course law right thank you thank you yes welcome to SQL so SQL new batch and it went to the next month start yes or no so yes foreign foreign foreign we are discussing some content about SQL session law okay character functions are they and the next number functions are they and date functions are there and the conversion functions are there so particles and uh next in this video we are discussing about aggregate functions in SQL aggregate functions previously disconnected 20 functions foreign [Music] set off rows set of rows and give one result per group and a particular group of data is there and some group of data is there a group means foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] then we are going to discuss about aggregate functions at a group of data the groups alone some set of data I mean some functions aggregate functions and these functions mostly okay appear in order by class having class order by Anda having class at 821 winner he functions aggregate functions available having class law and the Whitney Group by classes okay I learned so simple guys group functions to written group functions to written okay summary of summary of summary okay summary information for each group each group [Music] okay aggregate functions [Music] syntax very simple syntax here so LD function name same thing as a function okay group function name and a distinct or less than the all column particular distincter single unique values same value repeated more than one time foreign duplicate known eliminate Chase to calculated distinct keywords otherwise director column name alignment is remember that so this is the name of the function group function s [Music] aggregate functions it may be one of the aggregate function you adjust them one is a call to start a you Jason count to Star and next turn of the expression and count expression count expression count expression and next term sum 1823 aggregate function sum of foreign average average and next to Min and 820 minimum and the next in 20 maximum Max so these are the aggregate functions recounting of set of values or not set of rows or not not only counting one row one rule is no meaning there is some group values so next Resident is some someone is some different valuation and average foreign foreign [Music] that means number of values are there from number of values we are getting maximum value maximum value let's say all these things practically here so even if foreign right and the next one is another table name is called employee right command is awesome value like this and see see the employee table here select the star from select the star from star from EMP employee table how to select the data and it went to the already one of previous videos so select star from EMP employee table and selected yes and uh see this is an implied table so in this employee table here employee number is the employee name is the job column is there and uh manager manager column and that means this employee manager ever equals and this particular employee joined in London employee working in which department richer Department [Music] see here take the department number solution then the department is there 30 Department 10th department and uh 20 20 and 30 30 30 30 and 20 30 and uh 10 and 820 Department numbers are there and each department law number of records are there or not number of records are a foreign [Music] selector select count an 820 function count star select the count to star star star means entire table loan date [Music] yes 14 records 14 14 is there now 14 records are there accounted repeated so repeated values in the county is how to change 7839 repeated seven eight three nine repeated and this repeated seven five double six seven five double six again repeated and the next seven six uh nine eight repeated repeated repeated repeated okay a distinct of MGR MGR manager from a currency from from EMP table employee table semicolon enter see without the repeated values seven eight three nine one and next to seven five double six two seven nine zero two three seven six uh nine eight four and next term double seven double eight five and uh distincter distinct values I think it is not added not counted repeated values and null values it ignores the distinctive keyword ignore the duplicate values repeated values no ignore this is expression this is Count Star Command the star indicates total entire table entire table so count on advantages and the next one particular column field valuation number of values are there count expressions without using distinct keyword just uh name of the column connected that is the concept of a counter and next to someone 823 function is there here so how to calculate means okay sum of selector select sum of sum of salary field salary field from a country from EMP table employee table semicolon enter see total employee salaries here total employee salaries five thousand plus two thousand eight fifty four thousand uh 215 and 2975 three thousand three thousand repeated [Music] okay [Music] duplicates 29 000 uh 25. three thousand one time added [Music] one time added equal to duplicate and advantages selector sum of selector sum of selector sum of internet salary salary and advantages distinct distinctive salary distinctive salary okay from a currency from EMP level NC employee table semicolon enter right C some difference is there or not because 3000 eliminated and uh 1250 eliminated okay 1250 and 320 the repeated repeated salary accounting what in elimination the answer okay so after uh elimination of those things whatever the salary is that that salary is displayed here like this we are finding the salary and also we are uh finding Department wise Department device h okay sir number of Records in Denver departments number of Records in 30 departments number of Records in 20 departments let's say that practically here okay now select uh select selected Dept DPT number selected Dept number comma count of count of MN ENT department number okay Department number from from EMP from EMP okay Group by Group by Group by Dept number Department at the 10th Department then counter foreign and the next 30 Department to 30 Department 3 30 Department four five six records here six is there a lot the 30 Department in 30 Department yes 60 is there and the next turn 20 Department 5 is there and count it in 20 department and the next 21 2 3 4 and 5. and the 10th Department how many records are there and three records and here and uh 10th Department one two and the next turn three like this department advisor records okay for that purpose here we are using Group by class ES the group functions to return summary information for each group it is Department what is the sum what is the number of Records in 30 Department 20 Department how many records are there and the Departments how many records are they summary or not like that like that we can calculate the group by summary some also Group by Sum see here and uh selector select the EPT number Dept number DPT number comma at each department advisor someone is some of sum of salary sum of salary calculator Dept number count of the EPT number from some EMP from EMP okay Group by Group by Group by human Dept number Group by Dept number semicolon enter see that the department to Total some sum of salary 9400.940 salary six members salary six members are getting total salary in 30 department nine thousand four hundred and in the 20 Department ten thousand eight hundred and seven fifty five of how many members five members and in 30 Department eight thousand seven hundred and fifty how many employees just three implies this is a summary or not okay now this is a way of using internet aggregate functions and also getting minimum maximum salaries okay getting minimum maximum salary see those things see those things and that means selector select minimum salary minor salary 800 is the minimum salary 800 is the minimum salary and next to Max up salary selector internally select Max of Cell Max of salary select to Max of salary from accountancy from EMP table employee table right see 5000 is the maximum salary here 5000 is the maximum salary say 5000 is the maximum salary so let's see so what is the minimum salary from each department from each department to engineering minimum salary and equipment to the display cover from each department to minimum salary EPT number Dept number comma salary from EMP from EMP Group by group just alone Group by Group by Dept number Department minimum salary 750 20 Department minimum salary 800. 10th Department minimum salary minimum and thirteen hundred and let's see next maximum salary of each department each department maximum salary select the same thing selector the EPT number DBT number comma and Max of salary Max of salary from from EMP from EMP foreign Group by depd number Dept number DPT number semicolon enter see 30 Department maximum salary 2850 20 Department maximum salary three thousand and the 10th Department the maximum salary five thousand minimum maximum of each departments selector select DPT number department number comma okay salary I mean up salary Max of solid Max of salary from from EMP from EMP athy Group by Group by d e b d number Group by DPT number semicolon enter see 30 Department minimum maximum 30 Department of minimum salary and maximum charge this is minimum and this is maximum 20 Department minimum salary maximum salary 10th Department minimum salary maximum salary and also we can find the average salaries by using average column average aggregate function foreign average AVG average of salary from from EMP employee table semicolon enter this is average and see here minimum maximum some some and average also common sum of sum of salary Department wise and the department device average AVG [Music] average salary from EMP Group by Department each group Department wise and also accounting number of employees in their particular Department count off gone tough counter net pencil let's see in next so see okay Department minimum salary maximum salary average salary Department minimum salary maximum and the sum of salary average salary and uh Center Department minimum maximum [Music] average salary like this okay data management this is completely summary of the employee daily right so this is a way of using aggregate functions aggregate functions you know okay on a different methods is and uh yesterday new batch starts in next month starts in next month so for that purpose here we are using okay now pythonlife dot in slash oracle.html on 820 website and this website the full okay website name is available [Music] bottom of this video make a comment section below total website a website Watch Andy object handy okay then enroll in SQL patch so Esq it may be ID students and also non-it students anyone can learn easily because of here there is no lines of code just very simple single line of commanded it is not like a programming languages in programming languages coordinates it may be data type Concepts [Music] anyone can learn SQL and the next support to all kind of programming languages all Technologies go SQL unite quantity supported language and also database is so learn a skill and get job easily thank you one enough hello everyone welcome to esql so SQL next to bad Channel The New Batch and Adventure the next month will start listening python life Dot in oracle.html and 820 website no this is so and uh demo foreign quotes so and the video available right so e videos foreign videos we discussed about the aggregate functions we discussed about the ddl comments DML commands so in this video what is exactly joined so why we are using Giant's concept here is in general database not only storing in one table we are storing data in more than one table not store data in one table we are storing data in more than one table in chapter um foreign in database as a relational and a relation is nothing but a table where the table is related to who one particular object but for example one of the table is student table and another one is course table conducted code statement foreign [Music] student information it is in this table course related data on it is some security reasons for example if anyone asked to display the student information so then we can open the only student to table not opening the codes table codes to table alignment open ing images okay at this time the student table is decided and the student table learned when the information something is uh okay foreign details ID [Music] and in this course ID enabled the cs1 cs1 and this name is Kevin SQL course name is SQL and quotes of e is uh just five thousand and five thousand five thousand and next one more student 102 student and next event is the name of the student and he is learning same CSR 11820 codes cs1 and this cs18 cs1 is python is the codes and this charges is like a 6000 whatever it may be and one more student to 103 student is there and his name is like Ravi and he is uh Learning Easy and ifnam AC ec1 and the next ec1 right 23 EC one is a Electronics Electronics right Electronics like this and this piece is eight thousand eight thousand is fees right student table and quotes this is completely related to only student information foreign what is the name of uh course name here and the next one what is the phase here and I20 data I could have not available not available in student data student to table foreign foreign who who are paying this 8 000. yesterday videos so it may be from both tables foreign foreign by using these common values by using this common values from both tables is same data and the data type and it went to the same ones data data and data type and it went to the same ones same of the column name column names foreign foreign one at one student learning which codes learning which codes summary 103 student learning which could send any only student data and advantages and uh course table open yesterday ec1 Electronics 8000 three student learning which course and how much fee he is paying an identity my question is foreign to retrieve data from two or more related tables into a meaningful result the two tables in joint yesterday meaningful results remember that thing right so see here that the common column common column connected defined yes right so giant tables must have at least one common column with the same data type under the data type and identity foreign we are mandatory using summer operated some operators those operators are it may be equal operator it may be less than or it may be greater than these values e conditions so that is the way of joining and the next Stone operations of different design conditions types of joints types of joints in your studio types of joints in types giant types and 820 types of joints foreign outer Giant and the next left outer right outer join floater joint cross joint cross join if we join operations inner joint energy operations is there and cs1 is that cs1 is there and e c one is there ec1 is there so data equals it may be greater than or it may be less than you just some and the next term selfish divide chest to a two tables and outer join outer giant matching records from one table matching records from one table okay and uh all records from another table simple all records from one table and matching records from another table all records from one table and matching records from another table and Japan left outer joint that means okay all records from left to side table matching records from right side table left outer Giant all records from left to side table and the conditional left side [Music] and matching records from right side table and Japan and right outer join all records from right side table and the matching records from left to side table and left side table and fill out the floater join that means enter the Integra so all records from all tables all records matching by non-matching all records are not going to be displayed either the name full outer giant and the grass giant is nothing but uh okay okay all records for example in table a having table a having M records M records and table B having n records total results for example table yellow three records are there and the table below four records are there that means m1823 n18234 okay each recording only twenty each record these are the types of joints here we are using equal operator okay accepted equal operator okay like better than or less until less joining and outer join that means all records from one table and matching records from another table and then expansion connected all records from left to side table and matching records from right side table right outer do all records from right side table matching records from left to side table and full outer means all records from both the tables cross giant means a number of Records in one table and N number of records from another table both are multiplied and the result and it went to the multiplication records so this is about a very simple information about joints and let's see practically these things right so here see the SQL prompt I have a table the table name is called employee table so I implied table Now display yes before that I'm using one command to set the line set line right like this so here I am selecting employee table select a star from select start from EMP employee table right so employee table is displayed here below employee name number is a employee name is there job is there and uh for the manager of this employees ticket only twenty employee manager ever and a higher date that means the date of joint and what is the salary of these employees and what is commission they are getting and they are working in which department that means department and the department and the 30 department and uh 20 department and this department names Department table the EPT Department table Select Staff from department and see Department table easily Department table law only department number is there and the name is a and the location is there that means they are working in which department and in which location is there but which employee is working on the 10th department is there no it is not there in a department table information employee Department information so which employee working in which department and uh okay that the department name and their address full data and 8.2 for that purpose which command we are using means here and using which type of giant means equid giant employees department number is there and a department table Law Department number is okay two tablespoons Department operations and booster government secretary department and advantages employee table somebody put matching records this 10 is a match with this number so after he recorded question along with this data and the 30 is match with uh 30 that means this record is displayed along with this uh Department data 520 is matched with this 20 and uh along with this department table information and 20 department on 820 this record and Advantage let's say practically how to display these things select select Circle in English names from here is the department table only and a department number implied table only a table mentioned Department distance selector foreign read out the salary and the next Commandments number employee development department number comma D dot Department table and chair department number comma D dot d name Department name comma from Department table d dot location all right location and from a currency is equal to equal to and the next term D dot Department table number number semicolon enter Department employee table on date 23 10th Department match with the Department table on date 20 10th Department and uh employee table only twenty twenty Department match with the Department table on the 2020 department and the employable only 2030 is matched with the Department table 30 but this party is not matched and this record is not displayed here see the answer see the answer how it displays see okay 14 records are displayed but even this would only imply okay nothing and like his job is President his salary is a okay five thousand and this number at the employee table on the 20 department and the department Department so department is the in the along with the Black Creek E30 sales see here sales alignment in the display in the next 10 is again matched with here 120 match with this record and uh 20 is match with this one 20 is match with 20 is match 30 is match here and 30 is match result and 30 and the next 20 and 30 and 10. 40. join equation is and see here and non equivalent system instead of using instead of using equal operator then you change it may be greater than or it may be less than so if you only greater than 100 at the department number employee table only 20 department number is greater than Dept number greater than greater than see greater than condition employable only twenty Thirty is greater than Department laundry 2010 greater than the employee 10th department is greater than a particular students see what is the condition applied here what is the condition applied here and the department table owned 20 Dept number Dept Dept DPT number this one is the department table on the 20 department number but department is only just 400 10 20 and the thirty Thirty and forty forty is there 40 is there under this column this column is greater than this column is greater than and Department table only 20 discount column and see 10 is greater than 10 you record the display of the no this one not the displayed and the 30 is greater than 10 yes this record yes this record is displayed and see here and the next 30 is greater than 20 yes along with the 20 30 this is no it is not displayed records conditions right so record 20 is greater than 10 join with this record like this is [Music] so this is way of joining equation and non equivalent and also self-agine outer joints left outer joint right outer Giant and Cartesian products are also there those will see in our regular class right and here okay next next is and uh foreign not only three hours not only four hours not only five hours videos in three days SQL in the three hours SQL in five hours it is not possible to get a complete content in a three or four or five hours so it requires it requires okay minimum of uh minimum to maximum or kind of 40 to 45 days duration and Adventure required the duration we are providing foreign thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL so yesterday so for that purpose I displayed here one website to you so that website is pythonlife dot in slash workout.html so this is the website okay now to the batch of basic to Advanced SQL with the bachelor next month foreign foreign slash oracle.html website is available in comment session also right so in this video videos sub queries sub queries so in our previous videos we discussed about the joints we discussed about the aggregate functions but what type of queries we used as of now and then we used queries different types okay foreign query is available as parent query query is available as simple and subscribe root query is there and parent query is foreign it is an independent query conditions it is a completely independent it is not depend on any other values condition values condition values are not depends on other query other values so what is independent uh value or less than independent query or less foreign values okay which depends on the query which depends on okay other query other query for its condition value it's a condition value purpose it's a condition value purpose it depends on other query it depends on other query remember that depends on other query that the other query is called sub query but other query is a query means what sub query sub query is nothing but to query within the query query within the query is called okay within the query yes to vary within another query is called a sub query or legendary child query child query right this is about the child aquarium conditions okay appear in in where class appear in a where class of the another another SQL query where Clause embedded in embedded okay embedded in embedded in where clause where Clause of another SQL query where class and next one more Point here so is the sub query provides uh values to parent query depends on another query is query provides sub query provides conditional values to its parent query summer foreign operators like equal operator less than greater than and greater than or equals to less than or equals to in and between an Infinity operators to execute the sub query we are using this kind of operators here [Music] we can write 255 sub queries here remember that 255 255 sub queries and this is about the sub query and the sub query syntax how to write the syntax here okay okay C select the column name and a column list not only one column we can select more than one car from table name and where where column name here expression operator that expression operators we are using these operators any one of these operators this expression operator okay instead of this place in SRAM here we are using any one of this operator I'll next term column and column name column name again supper this is subcoil here this is the query and uh sub query is the same general query query executed first and is that value is compared with this operator and finally this outer query earlier than the parent query alignment so once again here sub query this is sub query sub query resides in a open and closed parenthesis this is open and this is closed parenthesis in between this open and the closed parenthesis in between this open and closed parenthesis we are writing sub queries sub query and inside of this sub query it returns under this sub query is executed faster sub query executed first and this will this will return a value and that value is compared with the here expression operator expression operator so the expression operator it may be it may be equal operator it may be greater than or it may be less than or it may be greater than or equals to it may be less than or equals to or in operator or between operator the employee operator all right with this column value and executed this outer query letter query is foreign like this yes and here I am writing simple questions star from select the star from select star from EMP is but it is not depend on any other values directly query and Adventures that query okay executed this command this data summary okay what is the maximum value ultimate already aggregate functions are going to be discussed on to display maximum values but how to display maximum value here and declaration selector selector select the internet select Max of salary select the max of salary from from EMP from EMP right so this is the maximum salary getting this maximum salary for getting this maximum service who are getting a maximum salary and approved right here we are writing query like this just select selector e-name e-name command EMP number empa number comma e-name comma salary salary from from Anderson from EMP EMP like this EMP where conditions where where salary equals to salary equals to salary equals to like this salary equals to Max of salary it is an error Urdu ously error message error group function is not allowed here because number PMP number comma key name rename comma salary salary from from from EMP from EMP where condition is where salary equals to people operator okay expression expression operator less than the comparison operator foreign [Music] clear all right so semicolon enter semicolon enter see so King who are getting maximum salary King his number is uh okay seven eight three nine name is King getting salary five thousand see here equal to 4 getting 5000 King and his job is President job is president so like this we are using sub queries not directly using this values implies this is the equivalent record here or getting minimum salary who are getting minimum salary same thing selector okay select e-name selected e-name Emperor EMP number EMP number is coach no problem and e-name comma job job comma salary salary from from a currency EMP from EMP and where wait where salary equals to where salary equals to events select select the payments salary minor salary minor salary okay salary from EMP from EMP minor salary from EMP and Brace close always a query resides the inside of the parenthesis Pitney open and closed parenthesis open and closed parenthesis and the first sub query is executed here and a sub query value [Music] Okay so until that means this uh outer query are learning take this uh parent query depends on the sub query value sub query value minutes so see see the output here right so who are getting minimum salary here 800 is the minimum salary 800 is the minimum chance that a 800 getting whom getting whom and even Smith okay 7369 Smith and job is Clark job is clear and he is getting gate 100. 800 where is the 800 in your EMP table here is the 800 here is the Italian but this record is like this 7369 Smith Clerk and uh she is getting minimum of 800 rupees sir this is a way of using a sub queries the right quality concept no it is okay in our regular class regular class law okay everything will discuss everything will discuss okay so this is a way of getting a data by using by using intended okay sub queries all right and if we want the full content about this codes okay you may use this website that website is called pythonlife dot in oracle.html on 820 website the ujc okay full information students also easy to learn SQL and uh they will get the job easily in it companies okay so and also this is very backbone to all kind of programming languages now your ultimate goal is to store the data in a database but to store the data in database two we can store the data in database Evergreen tools [Music] Evergreen and uh in our in our future also SQL and Adventure you can get the job easily right thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL foreign SQL new batch so next month is details and the course syllabus and project details and next what we covered and type this batch and adventure so pythonlife.in oracle.html Network in detailed information Monday website details so use that uh okay website and enroll in a SQL New Branch right foreign language in our previous videos like ddl comments ddl commands and DML commands DML commands DML commands ddl and DML commands and a ddl commands data definition language commands so is database that means creating physical structure in database modifying the physical structure in database and finally if you don't want then we are removing physical structure from the database by using ddl commands and taking the ddl commands almost to book a physical structure now abbreviated as data manipulation language data manipulation language it is okay by using DML commands DML commands so already TCL transaction control Language by using DML command oh DML and 820 commands in ugc we can insert a record and we can update the command update update the command update the data in the update the data in database or level 3 in table automatically insertation updates if you don't want uh that particular record and just delete operation delete the DML operation slope insertions updates eyelid delete operations roll back roll back and save point save point foreign video here so generally transaction control language what is transaction here what it what is transaction transaction is nothing but uh it's a unit of work logical unit of work unjust it's a logical unit of work operations it may be update or it may be delete foreign [Music] this transaction May store okay and whatever the changes happen in your okay in your database that the transactions May permanent storage need database Block store of Bali permanently right transaction changes can be made permanent to a database only if they are commitment foreign record okay unexpected unexpected some operations so that the change that the change and it went to the restore want to restore in your database ReStore in your database then we are using rollback command rollback connect 20 commandering transaction control and a transactions by using committer and by using rollback by using save point major things and a transaction is nothing but even it is a logic logical unit of work DML operation DML operation performed on your table s DML operation performance changes if we want the permanent store then we can use commit statement earlier if you want uh okay if you want to get back that transaction so roll back 20 commanding you just know enter transaction committed earlier database database not required to store roll back rollback connect 20 command me you just know roll back around so let's see practically these things and uh okay scroll back okay uh class how to see okay now how to use practically and I have a table that the table is called uh okay personal table is there personal table is there so I'm selecting the table select select a star from selector star from person person selected star from person right no rows are selected that means in that table there is no rows there is no rows right I am opening a structure of that table d a s s e table name person okay person semicolon right here person ID is there PID P name Edge is there so now I am inserting data into this table person table and after that I changed some modifications in the table and uh I'm applying TCL commands okay so first uh India the Monday ending some information in our previous videos person ID 101 101 comma person name person name person name is any name like naresh and the next Persona age okay right like this one record is created here one record is created and next again I'm executing same query and changing the data is ramu okay and the age of the person is 28 28 like this okay and the next turn yeah one more recording here one more record here and again the same record is created and next so one more record right so 1 0 3 1 0 3 or level one zero four one zero four and uh so Ravi is a Ravi Ravi 126. right so like this like this we are creating records into the table so next to select the star from select a star select the star from enter the person select the star from person semicolon enter right these are the records take the same record is copied multiple times foreign foreign this is the happen foreign okay where condition where condition right where and uh p i d person ID equals to 1 0 2 1 0 2 semicolon enter semicolon enter semicolon enter see here so I'm deleting this record one zero two equal to 102 records are there one zero two row two records those two records are deleted from a table foreign deleted two rows deleted [Music] so okay select a star from select a star from enter the person select star from person and enter see here this is a concept is foreign semicolon enter see here rollback completed scroll back complete rollback complete and select the table here select uh select star from selector star from what only select the star from person select to start from person semicolon enter right and uh restart the 102 or not one zero two restart one zero two please okay delete from delete from person delete from person where where okay PID p-i-d equals to 1 0 2 p i d equals to one zero to semicolon enter right two rows deleted now see selector select to start from selector star from person select the star from person semicolon enter right so now I am using commit here I am using commit I am using commit commit okay now semicolon enter byte commit completed and see now now see select to start from select star from select the star from person select to start from person semicolon enter right here intending not restored these two records these two records not restored and again I am using rollback here roll back roll back roll back roll back semicolon enter right rollback completed but roll back completely together foreign adding we deleted permanently these two records are deleted permanently deleted permanently so because select to start from select a star from select a star from star from select the star from select star from person [Music] select a star from person semicolon enter see no and it would roll back the right one to the M1 modifications to restore the modifications to restore the modifications then immediately immediately you can use the rollback command not commit command if you use commit command that modifications permanently database so rollback connect one to the ug73 so a permanent storage foreign updated one row updated and selected this row select star from select to start from select star from person select a star from person semicolon enter see changed or not foreign roll back roll back roll back semicolon enter and select the table here select select star from selected star from person select a star from person semicolon enter c roll back completed or not so what is the value of provision edge of the Ravi 26 years now 28 and after that the immediately English no rollback you just know again uh 26 is a restored or not 26 is restored and again the changes changes in the update command update age age equals to age equals to 28 is equals to 28 where condition where p i d p i d equals to where p i d equals to MN okay 1 0 4 p i d equals to 1 0 4 semicolon enter yes one row updated here one row updated and after update okay sorry check it and select uh select star from select to star from token 800 percent select the star from person semicolon enter right 28 is there now I am committing commit commit I want a permanent store commit right commit completed here commit completed commit completed then select the table selected roll back to you just direct to roll back roll back roll back and a semicolon enter roll back semicolon enter see here roll back completed and the next turn okay now select select to start from select star from but sir person see he changes these changes are not restored here and a semicolon enter enter see so not the restore to 26. this is the way of okay get back that data early that day to store the permanent data to store permanent or legendary data and 8. how to restore by using rollback command how to store permanently by using commit Command right and with okay in our regular session law and uh in-depth information alignment and how to use the save point right this is uh how can I using commit and roll back and uh those are the language comments of transaction control language commands transaction control language commands right so in the transaction control language and Advantage concept and the next term okay next month SQL new batch and advantages to click on that website and go through this uh website thoroughly and the next enroll the batch whatever we started in next month right thank you hello everyone welcome to SQL foreign [Music] and next of these details and the next demo classes and all information is available in the python live dot in miracle.html basic to Advanced SQL Network this is about uh uh this website so pythonlife.in oracle.html here okay in this website so SQL news every day to a what's a class duration class duration is okay um [Music] in this video in this video we are going to discuss about introduction to PL SQL just interaction of the pl SQL foreign like what is SQL and what are the sub languages are there in SQL and in that sub languages what are the ddl commands and what are the DML commands and what are the TCL commands and next to how to create a table how to retract the table and how to update the table and how to alter the table and how to use aggregate functions and how to use joins and how to use a sub language sub queries and how to use uh okay now built-in functions in SQL and how to create a views rather than how to use views in SQL all those things we discussed in our earlier videos either is foreign foreign that means here we are writing some statements in a blog wise blockwise okay and the next term and here here all the statements of blocks all the statements of the blocks positive to the Oracle engine at once particularly industry number of statements number of PLS skill statements can be passed to Oracle engine at once it later we are executing number of statements here foreign block of statements that means here we are using some block wise in each block contain the statement each block contain the very statements those blocks of statements can be executed at once it Returns the term various uh statements should be going to executed through that purpose so it increased the processing speed particularly ingest phenomenon increasing the processing speed processing speed alignment the increase of only and it decreases the traffic that means statement execution waiting and 820 degrees okay so this is a SQL Server assume that SQL Server this is a database foreign I am PLS all these statements are executed at a time in PL SQL execution speed alignment increase autumni so that is the main difference between SQL and plsql foreign right so and uh okay so SQL queries suddenly SQL is the standard database language and pl SQL is strongly integrate integrated with the SQL foreign foreign DML comments also so this is a main feature of internet plsql so please sending entire block of statement statements to the database number of statements okay entire block of statements to the database 80 times database it is by using plsql we can save the time to design the program application and also here some error handling mechanisms are they error handling mechanisms are there that mechanism name is called exception handling algorithm and some encapsulation under the main system oops of features are supported plsql programming PLS skill programming can support the groups of features save the time handling exception is nothing but the runtime error and some encapsulation and that means binding the data together kind of data hiding under that means it is not the display entire data at a time what you need the information only executing and the remaining unnecessary information is a hide features it provides a high level security can provide high level security Security provide yesterday high level Security provide yesterday so it can uh used to other than the pl SQL provides support for developing web applications web applications PL SQL can support the web applications web applications and the server pages server pages and web applications by using plsql PL SQL and the most disadvantage in the SQL why PL SQL is coming into the picture means SQL can support SQL can support our level day SQL can pass only one statement only one statement to the Oracle engine this is a main drawback in SQL SQL management SQL statements are positive Oracle engine one at a time and we can pass the only one command to the yes Oracle engine so which increases the traffic and that means uh processing speed and advantages advantages at one time and it is not the used to SQL not used to execute the more than more than one statement at a time foreign so that is the main advantage of plsql and eponym these are the differences between SQL and plsql and here we are discussing about the main structure of the plsql PL SQL structure structure of PLS skill block block structured language here foreign foreign declaration block and begin the statement begin the statement and the next exception block exception block and finally end the program PL SQL program and a Nifty num first one which is declare okay this one is a declare declare under declaration statement block and next one purchase begin main executable statements very most important thing foreign begin and the next exception block exception okay exception exception block exception block and finally event end block and the end of the program this is a PL SQL black structure PLS scale block structure so declare Declaration section in this declaration section in this declaration section so we are declaring some statements so see the entire PL SQL block structure like this declare so in this declaration some declaration statements those are declarations may be it may be variables it may be constants it may be cursed or it may be any other Concepts we can declare okay now so here in declaration we are declaring the variables we are declaring the constants we are declaring the curses if you want to declare any statement that should be declared inside of the declare statements at the beginning means so what statements you need to execute exactly what kind of statements you want to execute exactly that should be happen in the beginner statement okay now begin section begin block this is mandatory and it is optional if you want to declare any variables if we want to declare any packages and declaration and exception are the optional sections here optional those should not be used if it is not mandatory if you if you want if you want then only you can declare those are sections what are that so foreign those are not mandatory and Japan those are not mandatory remember that and uh begin law exactly what statements you want to display that should be this okay created in uh okay begin section begin section right so and the next exception is the nothing but uh okay now yet random errors runtime errors oh that means it should not be display the output summary then related statement is statements section so in this exception section we are identifying the runtime errors and those errors are identified by some conditions that should be written inside of the exception black and finally it executed the statements that related error statements a statements block enter the pl SQL program at least one minimum of a program management at least it is not mandatory and exceptional unable to the not mandatory and uh identifier is nothing but the name of the variable name of the constant name of the function name of the package name of the cursor name of the trigger name name identifiers those identifieds are declared in a declaration section is stored container if you want to store any value that value should not be directly okay that value should not be directly assigned earlier than declared value is so that purpose that means variable is nothing but to store The Container Store the container variable is nothing but stored container and uh how to declare variable here how to declare variable at a variable to the declare reality name of the variable and data type name of the variable and data type c and the name of the variable name of the variable data type I indicator colon equals to colon equals to equal and value and 8. and finally semicolon like this like this variables okay see the completed declaration like this variable variable name data type data type name of the variable and data type that means that means what type of data you should manipulate or what type of data you want to calculate just foreign and a semicolon this is the way of declaring variable so now this now this Akin now this a can accept the number value it cannot accept a character value if you want a character and uh so we are cat 2 or less than a character and 820 data type thing you just put to know right and this is a behalf of declaring variables earlier than the identifiers and also here some different types of data types are there data type is nothing but the type of the data type of the data that means okay now what type of data you want to store in your what type of data you want a calculator okay what type of data you want to calculate so a type of data will calculate challenge data type data type data type is nothing but the type of the data type of the data type of the data you want to store in your database other than they want to store or you I want to calculate so that is called a data type share number data type is a Boolean data type is there character data type is there date time data type is there number data type can accept the integer value and also float value decimal values and Boolean and identity it can be your statement it may be true or false that kind of information you want to store okay okay and the character data and I want to store character or you want to manipulate the character so then you can use character data type and finally if you want the store data like a date and time related information then we can use a date and time data types these are the data types in a PL SQL okay clear observe all the things to hit so PLS begin exception in the right 20 statement like this so the concept is comments that means uh comment it can provide the detailed information about your program foreign these comments uh should be ignored by compiler okay now these comments are not executed comments are ignored by PL SQL compiler they remember that comments are ignored by ignored by plsql compiler PL SQL compiler comments are ignored by the pl SQL compiler and these comments are two types and depth number one is the single line comment and uh another one is a multi-line comments single line comments and a multi-line comments under problems single line comments single line comments single line comments starts with the double iPhone double iPhone that means the comments inside of the single line whatever the information is there inside of the single line that the information is ignored by the pl SQL compiler comments so multi-line comments uh starts with the okay now slash that means forward slash star and end with the okay slash star under like this like this now you can write a n number of now you can write you can write you can write inside of this statements any number of lines of statements those should be ignored by the compiler like this that should be ignored by the compiler if you want to write a multiple lines of statements uh okay then you can write okay multi-line comments that should be ignored by plsql compiler remember that remember that and data types already be discussed variables we discussed in PL SQL how to declare variable those things and the next turn here PL SQL operators PLS skill operators are there PL SQL operators and uh so next term in our regular Concepts we can cover we can cover PL SQL operators PL SQL operators PL SQL operators okay and next in this PL SQL operator in this PL SQL operators we can cover right so like automatic operators automatic operators and relational operators and the next term so comparison operators logical operators string operators operators in plsql and some control statements control statements PL SQL conditional statements PL SQL conditional statements foreign statements in this PL SQL conditional statements we can cover if conditions if health conditions and effective conditions nestative conditions and speech case statements okay a conditional statement slow you adjust them and the next one which is a looping statements looping statements looping statements means the same statement should be executed n number of times number of times statement is until the condition is false condition false okay foreign foreign statements witness special control statements and go to statements go to statements [Music] and also because PL SQL procedures PL SQL procedure and procedure is nothing but the amount of money and the procedure is nothing but okay this is a block of statements other than one or more statements can be executing a specific task is functions in plsql functions and process that sir both are same under and with the small difference 30 and very similar functions and process that's an 820b very similar and 820 concept to 30 minutes small difference cursor is statements it is holding the summer statement rows in a table or some rows yes and that means that the selected statement may be okay uh updated or it may be deleted or it may be whatever it may be any action will happen on the top on that statements foreign [Music] exception very most important thing exception so real time all our exceptions so that means you could have different conditions foreign trigger is nothing but automatically executing the some statements automatically executing the statements some foreign foreign foreign so right so I'm sharing to you PL SQL prompt in SQL prompt very beginning very beginning we should execute one command set server server outputs output on output on semicolon enter and yes in declaration section in declaration section so I declared a one variable here that variable name is called gar and that data type is Bearcat 2 of 40 until that means this variable can accept the character Bearcat two data types okay that means it may accept the character's Island numerical values of 40 digits and here I'm assigning a statement like I am learning plsql here so this statement is assigned to this variable and it is purely in characters are there so those characters are enclosed in a single quotation here and the next beginner section and I wanted the startup only inside of the begin section we are writing uh some executable statements this is one of the method to execute the output to display the output on screen so dbms underscore output dot to put the underscore line and here we are calling the bar variable and that we are variable having the message like this one this message is displayed on screen to display the message on screen here we are using this method that is called dbms underscore output dot put underscore line and finally end of the end of the end program end the pl SQL block enter the pl SQL block like this we are declaring the pl SQL programs here more than one statement is there that more than one statement is executing a data and if you want execute this PL SQL block here I am using forward slash forward slash and I am pressing enter button okay now then this statement is executed so I am learning plsql here this is your output and finally it displays a PL SQL procedure successfully completed it uh it is a default statement for every PL SQL program from this program like this we are executing the pl SQL programs PL SQL programs regular session so we can use n number of plsql programs with the different different statements uh and uh all these statements are executed here foreign right next to enter the SQL batch an 823 next month online okay so then website tonight so go through that website thoroughly and enroll the use the enroll button and join the new codes anyone can learn so that means ID students and non-it students also can learn easily available foreign website and use this enroll button and uh enroll in this course right and thank you one and all ow you everyone welcome to SQL so just kill new batch and it went to the next month to start yesterday so for that uh we have a website here that website is called pythonlife dot in slash oracle.html and it went to the website e website law is available only that means so course details running and quotes of syllabus under what the syllabus we covered in this uh SQL 1823 iron next demo classes scanning all information is available in this website and next to go through this website properly and the next enroll how can I click on enroll button and continue in now SQL batch right and the video comment session website that means python life dot in slash oracle.html and uh and most of the people SQL and get job in ID so available okay and watch the most properly and uh join in SQL new batch that will start in next month right and coming to this video okay so we use an 820 concept views so in our previous videos in our previous videos we discussed about sub queries aggregate functions joins and the next term ddl commands and DML comments in a different concept sequencies what is an View view is nothing but a virtual table and virtual table view is nothing but water day virtual table virtual table means what the virtual table virtual table means what that means create an 820 command in UTC we can create a table okay table alignment is by using Create command so here I have a table I have a table in this table some columns are there some columns are they those columns are it may be this table may be a student table and a student ID is there and student name is the student name is there and student uh H is The Edge and address and marks whatever the data is there whatever it may be so information is there for example student ID S ID and yes name student name and the next term page of the student and address of the student address address right this is a student table assume that student table student right student table physical table name of the student and his age is like this and the next his address is uh hyd whatever it may be and one more student is there that the student ID is like that and uh his name is like this okay so his age is like this and the next uh sec right whatever it may be secunderabad whatever it may be foreign student ID and student age foreign table on top of student ID and student age he given to me permissions like access permissions entire table entire table accessing permission on 823 providation student ID student name page address foreign [Music] my requirement is I want to access student ID and age but he given to me permission as to access the entire table a tablet student ID and students foreign part of the information know that that means part of the information part of the information separated separated part of the information anti-operative information student ID and student ID and name and age student ID and name internally student ID and the age of the student age of this student like this age of the students this is not the physically stored in the database it is organized from this table foreign whatever the information you required that the information only selecting from this uh entire table that is created as a virtual table that is created as a virtual table virtual tables a virtual table that is not stored physically in your database it is not stored physically in our database always this is populated from this table is database it is not a physical table it is a virtual table virtual table it is a virtual table okay so on top of this virtual table we can insert the data insert the new data in this area already the included 20 data and it went to the correct new next new data and you can update this video this view can be updated this view can be updated view can be updated and this view can be deleted okay in a viewed Institute data is should be applied on top of this view also if you mean again as a remember that we can do we can do we can select The View we can select to The View and we can insert a new data into we we can update the data and we can delete the rows from The View also okay so select operation we can perform select operation right so select operation and the insert operation insert operation right see right select operation insert operation we can update the view we can delete the rows from views on top of The View that modification should be happen in this table also physical table mean operations should be applicable on top of the physical table also under if you know a table lunch menu created operations [Music] remember that and the next two in Japan all right and uh simple syntax and how to create a view right so syntax here create again we are using Create command or replace create or replace why replace here that means that means if already view is created by this name that should be changed this values and take around 820 statements and replace the view and previously whatever the view we created that is the replaced with the the statements economy new statements create same thing is that means already view an 820 the existence create or replace View keyword s okay now optionals or replays are also optional whatever the statement resides in the closed parenthesis parenthesis closed brackets okay Alias names foreign database to select the part of the information from the physical table physical table part of the information no selected yes why we are selecting part of the information from physical table foreign so that purpose we are creating the view okay remember that term view is a virtual table always this view is a populated by a physical table physical table mean s that the part of the information is created as a view created as a babe that information is shared to a required person foreign and let's see the practically about this thing so see here Okay so I'm sharing to you SQL prompt SQL prompt okay this is for my comforter for my comfort to display the tables and uh here selector select the star from select the star from tab see list of the tables and Views already I created previously so here student view is there and Mark's view is there and the student view 2 is there and uh enter the sample view is there these are the views in my area how can I use that is not available employee table is there employee table is the employee table is there on top of the employee name is selector select the star from select star from M15 select star from EMP select to start from EMP here some data is there employee table related data is there employee table related data is there here right so on top of this uh employee table I am creating a view so for this purpose create an 820 command and you just now create command create command create ingredient view create yes EMP underscore view EMP underscore View View and as as selector as you select payment selected yes EMP number EMP number employee number comma comma e name e name is salary field salary salary field and the next comma Dept number the EPT number Dept number department number from a currency from EMP table employee table the and those implies details like EMP number e-name job salary Department number View and a semicolon enter okay see here we've created or not done we've created view created and selected that the view simple range select the star from select star okay now select to star from enter the EMP EMP underscore EMP underscore view semicolon enter see see here summary foreign [Music] okay it is not a physical table it is not a physical table it is not a physical table remember that so we are selecting data from this View okay so you could okay select to start from select to start from tab select to start from tab an 820 query you just now see here here we have a list of the tables etc etc okay now where is our EMP View EMP view okay so student table student student and EMP is there right here is there empview empview it is created as a view it is created as a view EMP View and Advantage is created as a table it is created as a view created as a view of the Creator is a table table means it is a physically stored in your database table and 820 and then that is uh physically available in your database this is physically available in your database and view is nothing but it is a virtual information virtual information virtual information it is not physically available okay now always generated this query every time generated this query and pick up the data from uh okay now this physical table and it is displayed as a table it is not a physical table it is not a physical table it is a virtual table is a view and I'm selecting just terms part of the information from that view again just EMP number EMP number comma salary salary from a currency EMP underscore EMP underscore view EMP underscore View and semicolon and enter c here and it is working like a internet table and uh we can select and also we can update update the data sorry select the star from selector star from enter the empview empview empview and here see here and one of the employees having a 950 salary I want to change this 950 that is automatically updated in the table also foreign EMP unders yes [Music] 7900 only one row is there that one row is uh updated here Islam and the semicolon enter see here clerk 7900 James clerk is a job and uh six thousand taken 950 is changed as a six thousand nine fifty is changed as a six thousand and that means view is updated or not view is updated comfortably and check that information is physically updated Universe physical table or not so if you are equal to the economics and the employee table which is Select to start from EMP EMP semicolon enter see here see here here also changed or not thousand yes changed and I don't want uh the modification because the information is uh also changed in physical table very beginning okay operation test the more that the operation also affected in the physical table also and also and also we can discuss in detail about in our regular class like how to insert a data in term View and how to delete the data from View and how to alter alter the view at the physical table modification changes [Music] foreign is completed and select the view select uh select uh select to star from selector star from image film EMP underscore V PMP underscore View EMP underscore view semicolon enter see 9950 is modified 950. foreign View for example one of the customer required this uh employee table is one of the employee required this employee table TS information information is foreign foreign and we created as a view we will create dishes so what operations now it is confidential foreign yeah they're there okay not required information into law and uh information and I went to the confidence not sharing too okay people people could save chaitlyn this is about the simple concept of view and in our regular class we can discuss okay now in detailed in detail that means how to inject the data into view and how to apply okay now delete operations on view all right that will start in our next month next month okay uh new batch less than a new batch on 820 next month to start out from the next month startup so then to be available that website name is called pythonlife.com python live dot pythonlife dot foreign okay next month plus green C in detailed information and available sir class every day Monday to Saturday six to eight p.m evening also foreign working days foreign not only for particular persons this is for all kinds of people business business foreign thank you

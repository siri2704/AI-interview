hello everybody Welcome to our channel so today in this video we will we will be discussing about Keys the concept of keys in data table or data relations okay so we have super key we have candidate key we have primary key surrogate key and we have also secondary or alternate key simple key and composite key so these are are the type of keys that are defined on a relation or on any table we will be looking in details of each different kind of keys that is defined Above So suppose uh this is the table and in this tables the attributes that we already know is ID name Department name and salary so what is super key here to understand the Super Key let's see this table this table have role number first name last name date of birth passport a department if you look carefully then Super Keys is that attribute the set of attributes that can Define each row or each Tes in a relation uniquely I am again uh repeating the line what is super key Super Key of R if values of K are sufficient to identify a unique tle of each possible relation why are saying we are saying that each possible relation because a relation can have a different type of and different kind of instance because when we query uh from the whole relation we can uh query for different different kind of uh requirement and by applying different different kind of logical uh constraint so this the concept of case should be applicable for all instances of the relation R that's why we say that uh set of tles that is let's suppose K will be said a Super Key of relation if values of K are suff eent to identify a unique tle of each possible relation are means suppose uh in this case ID and ID name are both super key of instructor table okay so here we have a instructor table so here we have instructor table and if you see the attribute the ID and name these two attributes can uniquely Define whole row all Tes in relation means that the value of ID and names cannot be more than one times in a tles if you see this tles then you will find that any uh pair of ID name are not been repeated in the table so two to to Einstein's Einstein is not been repeated any times so this can be said as super Keys means any set of keys from the relation are that can uniquely Define the whole Rel whole Tes in r at any instance is called Super Key then now come concept of candidate key what is candidate dat key so candidate key is nothing but candidate key is nothing but so candidate key is nothing but out of Super Key suppose here we have ID and ID name both are super Keys mean both set of attributes can uniquely deter Define all the dou in a table now from this if the super key is minimal means without having name also if ID can Define what here we refer to minimal means that uh minimal means that if super keys can also uh Define all rows of relation uniquely without having any other attributes then it will be called a Super Key here and then it will call candidate key here id id is a candidate key for key instructor for the relation instructor VOR ID is candidate ke because it is minimal because not minimal not in the sense that here we have two here we have taken one no if there will be case that super key is ID and name okay Suppose there is a case that this is uh Suppose there is a case that uh this is the super key of and relation but it can also be candidate key if this was not the Super key if ID have not been the super key in the relation then ID and name can be candidate key because it is minimal why it is minimal because without uh name or without ID neither ID can Define whole at hold tles of relation uniquely or nor name can Define hold uh tles of relation uniquely so both needed together to Define all tles of relation uniquely so that in this case we said that this is minimal and from this this can become a candidate key of relation okay so this is the concept of candidate key now a relation can have more than one candidate key or more than one super key more than one candidate key also and out of all candidate key means out of all minimal Super Key based on some of our parameters that are parameters is very respective of each kind of relation that we have we select our primary key right now what is the concept of surrogate key here uh surrogate key is that suppose a relation does not have any suppose a relation does not have any uh unique identifier of relation neither it have any super key neither it have and means key the concept of key comes only when the set of attributes can uniquely Define a any all rows all tles of a relation and suppose a relation does not have any key then we generate a synthetic key or surrogate key the surrogate key we have to generate because we need to Define each row uniquely each doule uniquely in relation for that we generate surrogate key and that surrogate key is uh not related actually related to the data or the entirety of information that we are restoring but just for our understanding just for our reference we use super surrogate key or synthetic key so where we have mentioned that the surrogate key is not derived from the application data unlike a natural or business key which is derived from the application data right okay now so this are the example of Super Key candidate key and primary key now secondary and Alternate key what is the secondary and Alternate key as I had said earlier that a relation table can have more than one candidate key and the candidate key which have not chosen as primary key called as uh secondary key or alternate key in relation simple key uh simple key consist of all a single attribute so whenever you heard the name of key okay so observe uh carefully that whenever you heard the name of key in a table it means that the set of attributes that it have is able to uniquely Define all the tles of relation that's why it's named as key any kind of key either it's a simple key alternate key candidate key super key or composite key also if it is key then it's it's mean that uh directly saying that it can uniquely Define all the of relation now we also have composite key composite key when one attributes cannot uniquely Define all the tles of relation then we say that more than one attributes needed to Define each uni row uniquely in relation so this is come called as composite key okay so today we are learned about the keys uh of tables so a was discussion just about only one table like we have a table here and we can apply all our learnings on this tables also so see table have the attributes called Ro first name last name date of birth passport Adar and department so so if you have to choose what is the Super Key then Super key is a set of attributes that can uniquely determine each rows how we say that this attributes can anly determine each rows or each tles means the value of uh value of those attributes across the tles should not be repeated okay so if you see the r number then if you can see that R number is not repeating uh in across the to us so RO number is a key okay first name lit jatin Ram this is also a key last name du Chopra mongra dat means so this is also a key date of birth uh date of birth if you see date of birth if you see so in this scenario there are so many keys passport passport cannot be key one things as we go much detail about learning about the data and relation so there are some attribute like password so first of all to attributes on Keys is that the value of keys cannot be null okay value of keys cannot be null because null value means we do not have information about that particular attributes for the particular uh case or observation so how we can determine that is this uh actually uniquely determining row or not so we do not consider U attributes with having null values as key but here this is a thing is that this is thing is that as Adar as Adar is the unique identifier so as this is the what is happening is that Adar as we all know that for uh across the country each Adar ID uh holder Adar card holder have unique Adar number so this can also be key here uh we have only one example which says that uh this is not a key yeah uh this is also not a key right because you have null values here so this is not also a key by the way passport also have the unique uh number also but as it can have null values because some student may have passport some student does not have passport so this is not something that is required for all the student like Adar number every citizen have Adar number but every citizen does not have passport so this is not uh as because of null value it is excluded from the key Department yes Department we can see that uh if computers and computer is repeating so this cannot be uniquely determined the tles of relation how means for example if you say that I want the tles where the department value is computer so if we say like that then how we can decide we want which row because we have two uh tles in which the value of attribute department is computer so by this we cannot uniquely determine uh tles of relation so we exclude it from the our key list but as we have already said there are two ways in which we can Define key Either key can be simple key consist of single attributes single attribute single attribute single attribute single attribute or it can composite key comp consist more than one attribute so if Adar okay so let's first uh see that uh this is also Super Key this is super key Super Key all are super key okay one second uh one second so those are if you see here then so this is not a Super Key and this is is not also a Super Key remaining all are super key and all are minimal means without R because they have only single value so all are minimal also so they are candidate key also out of this candidate key we have to select a primary key so we can select a primary key out of candidate key and based on some our so let's say that R because we just have the limited number of tles in this table so but we know that name can be repeating for many uh many people's many students last name can also be repeating date of birth can also be repeating but passport will not repeating Adar number will not be repeating and RO number will also not be repeating so automatically in general case also these are already a key here we have excluded passport because we know that value of passports can be null because this is the uh University database this is the in college or school so we cannot say we cannot enforce that every student should have passport so this is candid these are the candidate Keys these are the candidate keys and we do not have any composite key but we can create a composite key uh as of combining these two attributes As We Know that this is also candidate key so this key is able to uh Define each row uniquely so combining these two can also will make no effect so combining this two also Define each row uniquely right what happen is that whenever you say that we what row where Al number is this and pass we where Adar number is this so just we can have a indexing and directly we can get the result of this double so one thing we have to uh uh keep in mind that by the way here we are considering passport as of its null value also we are considering it for key or composite key because adhar here is a primary key or a candidate key and it is able to Define each row uniquely if Adar was if the attribute is not able to Define all rows all Tes of relation uniquely so and for in that case if you have to make a composite key to Define each Tes uniquely then both of the composite key or all the set of composite key their value should not be null because null value cannot be compared because null is equal to null null means we do not know what is actual value so this should always be keep in mind before understanding the relation okay so this was about one actual table right this the thing is about one actual table now we will move to more than one table more than one table is that when we have more than one table like we here we have more than one table okay so we'll understand this also in the next lecture next video so when we have more than one table so we will also have the foreign Cas so these things will be more understandable when we understand this uh schema okay so for today as we understand about the keys concept of keys primary Keys candidate Keys super Keys secondry key a composite key and simple key thank you for watching have a nice day

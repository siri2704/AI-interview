hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I'll be covering ER model Topic in dbms I will explain what is er model and then I will explain what is an entity types of entities attributes types of attributes relationship and types of relationships and At Last I will explain what is entity said attribute set and relationship set guys I have uploaded a complete dbms subject tutorials I will provide Link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started at first I will explain what is er model in year model e stands for entity and R stands for relationship guide this ER model is nothing but it is simply a diagram I will give one simple real life example for example I want to construct house so I'll go to Builder whenever I go to Builder that Builder will collect all my requirements like how many rooms I want size of each room and where to locate Hull way to locate kitchen this Builder will collect all my requirements after collecting all my requirements He will draw one diagram and then he will show me how my house will look like after construction by seeing the diagram if I say ok then this Builder will start actual construction so in same way for example I am College owner I want to construct one database for my college so I'll go to software company in each and every software company there will be a database designer the main duty of this database designer is to draw ER diagrams so this database designer will collect all my requirements and then you will Design One ER diagram after designing ER diagram this database designer will submit this ER diagram to database developer then by saying the CR diagram this database developer will start developing actual database for example this is my simple ER diagram which is created by database designer like student guy this student is an entity will represent entertain rectangle for example students contains some properties like name rule number and section and we call this properties as attributes and we will represent attributes in ellipse for example this is simple diagram which is designed by database designer by saying this diagram this database developer will Design one table like guys entity is nothing but table so this database developer will create student table this attributes are nothing but columns so total there are three columns so one column is name next column is rule number and next column is section guys this is simple diagram which is designed by database designer then by saying this diagram database developer will create actual table in database software this is simple definition of er model ER diagrams are used to represent the ER model in a database which may easy to be converted into relations ER model is nothing but it is simply a ER diagram and by seeing this diagram we can easily create tables we also call tables as relations people those who don't have any knowledge can also design ER diagrams people those who don't have any knowledge on databases known as name users even Nave users can design these ER diagrams these are various symbols that we use in ER model and the first one is rectangle rectangle is used to represent entities entities are nothing but table names and next one is ellipse by using ellipse we can represent attribute attributes are nothing but column names if you want to establish relationship between two entities then we need to use this diamond symbol diamond symbol is used to represent relationship and next one is line you can connect all this by using line double ellipse is used to represent multi-valued attributes I'll give examples and next one is double rectangle this double rectangle is used to represent week entity these are three components in ER model and that first one is entity guys entity is nothing but table name guys entity is nothing but it is an object or thing that exists in real world for example car we can create car table we can create pen table we can create student table we can create faculty table and so on so this curve influence all our entities and we will represent entities by using rectangle and there are two types of entities one is tangible entity and next one is intangible entity physical object which we can touch or see is known as tangible entity for example if you consider mobile we can touch mobile phone and as well as we can see mobile phone and if you consist friends we can touch students and also we can see students we can touch and see cars by X1 so objects which we can touch RC is known as tangible entity and next one is intangible entity intangible entity mean objects which we cannot touch or see for example if you consider bank account entity we cannot touch this bank account because it is present in computer so objects which we cannot touch physically is known as intangible entity for example bank account entities are of two types they are strong entity and weak entity entities that contains primary key is known as strong entity and it is nothing but table name for example I created student entity issue identity contains attributes like name rule number section and age attributes are nothing but column names and we need to represent attributes in ellipse so inside ellipse are written name rule number section h for example if you consider rule number we cannot give same rule number for two different students so definitely we need to give different rule numbers for different students so primary key must contain unique values and it will not accept null values null is nothing but empty so definitely we need to give rule number for each and every student and it will not accept null values null is nothing but empty value and we will represent primary key attribute with underlying symbol so I am using underline symbol so if any entity contains primary key attribute then we call it as strong entity an entity that does not contain primary key attribute is known as wake entity if you consider this example this example there is no primary key attribute so in this joint entity there is no primary key attribute so we call this two indentities as weak entity and we will represent we can detain double rectangle so inside double rectangle I return strand next I will explain attributes and types of attributes an attribute is a property or characteristics of an entity properties of an entity is known as attribute guys attributes and ultimate column names for example if you consider strand is an entity this trend can contain various attributes like name rule number and date of birth not only three you can give any number of attributes and one of the attribute is considered as primary key whenever you give primary key for any particular attribute then this attribute will contain only unique values you cannot give same values for example if you give names I rule number 21 and date of birth 1997 for another student for example Raju here already I given toilet number 21 so again you should not give rule number 21 so you need to give different values like 22 and next to 23 for another student and so on and also this primary key attribute will not accept null values for example there is one strand like Rajesh date of birth for example 2000 and here I don't want to give rule number so what I will do is I will just write null but whenever you give primary key for any particular attribute then it will not accept null values so definitely you need to give any number and we will represent attributes in ellipse this is ellipse symbol we need to write attributes inside ellipse Alvarez for entities we need to use rectangle entity is nothing but table name attributes are nothing but column names these are various types of attributes I will explain each and every attribute by giving example first one is simple attribute attribute that cannot be subdivided into another component is known as simple attribute I'll give an example for example there is student entity initial identity there are some attributes like name rule number and date upper and also there is address if you observe this attributes I am not subdividing this just a written name rule number date of birth address I am not subdividing so we call it as simple attributes and next one is composite attributes attributes that can be subdivided into another components is known as composite attributes same example for example if you consider name attribute now I am subdividing this name attribute like first name and last name I subdivided this name attribute into two components they are first name and last name so we call this name attribute as composite attribute we cannot subdivide roll number and we cannot subdivide date of birth but we can subdivide address like State pin code State and door number so we call this address attribute as composite attributes attributes which we can subdivide into another companies is known as composite attributes and next one is single value attribute attribute that contains only single values is known as single value attribute for example if you consider rule number we can give only one rule number to particular student and for example if you consider data bar we can only give one date of birth this rule number attribute and date of birth attribute is both are examples of single valued attributes next I will explain multi-valued attributes attribute that contains multiple values is known as multi-value attribute for example if you consider mobile number we can give multiple mobile numbers and for example if you consider Gmail ID foreign can contain multiple Gmail IDs so this Gmail ID and mobile number this both are examples of multi-valued attributes that mean we can give multiple values and definitely we need to represent multi-valued attributes in double ellipse so inside double ellipse I need to write mobile number and inside double ellipse I need to write Gmail ID and next one is derived attribute that's for example first render given date of birth 1997 for example and now I want to calculate H if you want to calculate age of particular strand then definitely we need date of birth based on date of birth and present here we can calculate h so indirectly this age attribute depends on date of birth attribute so if any attribute depends on other attribute then we call that attribute as derived attribute and we need to represent derivative attribute in dotted ellipse this is dotted ellipse so this age attribute is derived attribute because this attribute depends on date of birth attribute and last one is key attribute key attribute is nothing but primary key for example if you consider this rule number attribute just I am giving underline that mean we call it as K attribute whenever you give primary key for any particular attribute then definitely we need to give different rule numbers for different strains and also it will not accept null values these are various types of attributes next I will explain what is the relationship a relationship represents the association between entities for example there is student entity and there is course entity I want to establish relationship between these two entities as we know student will enroll in course so I will connect these two entities by establishing enrolled in relationship we will represent relationship in rhombus or you can also call it as diamond symbol for example there is faculty entity and there is Department entity faculty will work for department so we can establish work for relationship for example there is customer entity and there is product entity now I want to establish relationship between this customer and product has been a customer will buy product so I am establishing biased relationship in this way by using relationship you can establish relationship between entities these are various types of relationships and the first one is urinary relationship the name itself says unarimine one if only single entity is participating in relationship then we call it as unary relationship for example there is person entity as we know person will marry to person so I am establishing married to relationship so we call it as unary relationship and next one is binary relationship binary mean two if two entities are participating in relationship then we call it as binary relationship these are examples if three entities are participating in relationship then we call it as ternary relationship for example student enrollment course and as well as faculty enrollment course so this enrolled in relationship is ternary relationship these are various types of relationships next I will explain what is the entity set attributes at an relationship set set is nothing but collection of elements at first have election what is entity set entity is nothing but table name and we will represent entity using rectangle so for example this is true indentity if this true identity contains only single record for example name PSI rule number 21 and age 25 for example if this entity contains only single record then we call it as entity for example if this entity contains multiple records like name Shiva rule number 22 h26 Raju ruler 23 and age 18. if this entity contains multiple records then we call this entity as entity set entity set is nothing but collection of entities this is one entity this is one entity and this is one entity so collection of entities is known as entity set Next Level explain what is attribute set for example if you consider this name attribute I am subdividing this name attribute into first name middle name and last name now this name attribute contains it like first name middle name and last name so we call this name attribute as attribute set attribute set is nothing but collection of attributes so we can also call this composite attribute as attribute set and next I will explain what is relationship set for example there are two entity sets one is show identity set and X1 is course entity set for example I want to create one separate table for enrolling relationship for that purpose we need to select two keys from these two entities here I'll select rule number and here I'll select Cid in this relationship table there are multiple relationships so we call it as relationship set types and relationship set types so whenever that question comes in exam you can write the same answer next I will explain what is dominant entity and subordinate entity for example let us considered there are two entities one is loan entity and next one is payment entity entity is nothing but table name I am connecting these two entities by establishing loan payment relationship person who has loan will do payments so if there is no loan entity there will not be payment entity for example a digital loan entity if I delete loan entity then automatically payment entity also gets deleted so we call this loan entity as dominant entity and whereas we call this payment entity as subordinate entity

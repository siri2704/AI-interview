good morning everyone myself pan Po in previous lecture we will see about uh database management system and after we will see a ER diagram in uh database uh management system ER diagram is nothing but the entity relationship uh diagrams in uh dbms now today we will see a detail uh with the help of examples real life examples which is also called as a case study okay today we will see case study of database management system uh now uh first uh case study is nothing but the uh how er er model is used to conceptual design okay to learn the effective way of drawing and uh designing ER diagrams okay the these are nothing but the entity relationship diagrams okay uh I will show you to learn the effective way of drawing and design ER diagrams why case study is necessary to learn the uh effective way of drawing and design ER diagram uh this is necessary let me see a first case study consider a trucking company which is responsible for picking Pi uh picking is uh uh equipment uh for warehouses of retail chain and deliver the uh shipments okay uh shipments for warehouses uh of retail chain and deliver the uh shipments to the individual Source location okay a truck may carry several shipments in a single trip and deliver it to the multiple stores okay draw an ER diagram for truck shipment system okay means this is a ER diagram for truck shipment systems now this single truck can carry a shipments for multiple uh stores that's why this single truck can visit visits to the multiple let me see ER diagram for uh detail about this example see here this is a truck mean here one to many relationships are there between single truck many shipments okay single truck carry shipments for uh multiple uh stores okay see here this is a single truck and this is a entity this these are two entity can be shown into the rectangle and he uh see here these lines are nothing but the relationship okay um now see here the truck consists of attributes truck number okay weight how many uh how many goods are stored into that truck is nothing but the weight okay means truck are having attributes truck number weight and truck volume okay these are the attributes of this entities truck okay means uh the table name is nothing but the truck and these these are the attributes stored in that tables these are nothing but truck volume truck number and weight and this can carry shipments shipments uh consist of ship number ship de and volume okay uh carry means one truck can carry for multiple store shipments okay and delivers for delivers warehouse warehouse number and warehouse location okay afterward one has to many means one Warehouse and many stores stores consist of uh the attributes of stores are the store number and store location or S location okay this is this is nothing but the entity relationship of single truck shipments for M multiple stores okay that's why the relations between these are nothing but the one to many means one can many shipments and also one Warehouse contains of many stores this is a druck shipments system first case study in dbms is nothing but the uh truck shipment system okay with the help of uh with the help of one example I explain case study that is nothing but the truck shipment systems okay let me see a second type of case study that is nothing but the draw an ER diagram for Airline reservation system okay now we have to draw a ER diagram entity relationship diagram for Airline reservation system here a passenger can book ticket for personal for a flight on the sum date okay mean why this uh here Airline reservation system the passenger can book the seats for personal flight okay now let me see about uh example see a single passenger okay uh this passenger uh passenger entty consist of name age and address attributes okay uh in passenger table name age address these are the columns which is also called attributes in dbms and here uh the passenger can book okay ticket uh booked on means Year date okay uh and ticket ticket consist of ticket number and amount okay ticket consist of two entities ticket uh entity consist of two attributes these are nothing the ticket number and amount attributes can be shown into the oval or uh entity can be shown into the rectangle and these lines are nothing but the relationship between this entity okay now see tickets for flight okay flight consist of number Source destination time and departure time okay uh these are the attributes of flight now see here ticket from personal or um this is nothing but a personal or passenger consist of employee number name Etc these are the attributes of Passenger after this is a Airline reservation system same you have to draw one case study for uh any project okay now see here this is a construct an ER diagram for car insurance company that has set of customers each customer own one or more cars okay means uh this is a case study of or ER diagram for car insurance company each are associated with more cards okay uh each associated with zero to any number of recorded okay accidents car insurance company okay which can um repairs the car provide Insurance to the customers now see here here it consists of Street customer customer consist of City uh City customer name and cust ID these are the attributes of customer class afterward Car customer here relation one too many okay car there are many models of cars okay car ID also or car accident ID and here relationship between one to many one car many accidents one car may may may be having many accidents then accident ID dat Day St this can be uh means one car accidents can be happens for particular car on various day that's why these are accident ID dat day stet okay and car this is about a car insurance system okay now let me see uh for case study draw an ER diagram for order processing system whereas person give order for Many Items by specific specifying its quantity okay now see here this is a order processing systems okay same way you have to draw entity relationship diagrams okay for taking particular case study item item number description Okay order order number one dig person person consist of name address and phone okay this is nothing but the um here diagram for processing systems okay where a person gives order for Many Items by specific specifying it quantity means many to one one person can gives order to many atoms that's why here relationship between person and atoms are nothing but the one to many okay for example one persons can um buy a multiple products on Amazon websites that's why one person multiple items okay uh now see a case study fifth case study a movie studio wishes to Institute a database to manage movie actors and directors okay the following factors relevant each actor has appeared in many movies each director has directed many movies each movie has one director okay means uh for particular movie there is only one director okay not one movie consist of more than one uh or two three more director okay only one director can produce one movie that's why relationship between one to one okay movie and director is nothing but a one to one relationship okay one or more actors but one movie consist of more actors okay that's why a relationship between movie and actors is nothing but the one to many okay each actor and actor may have several addresses now you want to draw a ear diagram see here this is a ear diagram for movie and actors uh here actor address actor address consist of attributes here multiple actors are there that's why this can be shown into the um double rectangle double line rectangle angle see here this actor address actor address can have actor ID City and Street and actor address actor name actor ID okay here relationship is many one movie can consist of many actors act movie movie many movie and see movie movie ID movie detail after director movie director one movie consist of only one director that's why one to many relationship is here and director name director ID after director address director address consist of director ID state city this is about a field industry system now we will see a sixth case study in database management system is nothing but the assum you are to compose database requirement of wholesale dealer for audio video consumer equipment from different manufacturers customers are various retail outlets wholesale extend credit to old customers Ral now we have to draw ER model for this see here this is a customer equipments okay uh entity relationship model entities uh customer equipment wholesale entities can be shown into the rectangle now see here these are the attributes attributes can be shown into the ellipse equipment ID customer hold and these are nothing but the lines are nothing the relation relationship between these uh two entities okay u customer hold equipment cost okay this is all about the wholesale dealer systems now same way um in a nursery the plants are sold to the customer these are nursery and nonflowering only Nursery are given to the plants with some uh Nursery include uh pesticides okay and watering and manure also okay now see here this is a uh plant nursery system this is a ER diagram for plant nursery System customer customer consist of customer number name address and here plant plant can be consist of uh name of plant okay Etc and here nutrients nutrients name name Etc here many many relationship one many plants are having many gives many nutrients that's why these are what here uh any too many relationship between these two entities now we will see this is I type of uh flowers there are two types of plants plants consist of two types that is incl flowering and non-flowering plants flowering plants which can use a flowers non flowering plants me they are for oxygen purpose okay that's why uh here this can be shown uh is a fling plant plant is a fling plant or non fling PL nutrients is a pesticides or watering or manure okay this this this is a year diagram for plant nursery system now let we study the eth type of case study in database management system that is nothing but the study the following case study and find out the entire draw ER diagram now you have to study study this okay and you have to draw diagram okay see the management of Life Hospital has decided to computerize their operations following information is provided by management me this is a case study of Hospital management system there are uh resident full-time Consulting doctors with uh various specialization Consulting doctors visit hospitals at the time every day or some days of week which varies from Doctor to doctor patients are admitted to hospital and their main uh cause of admission is recorded for accident case additional information such as police booklet number name uh name of police and accidents okay uh now this is a uh now we have to draw um a diagram for this okay just this this is activity for all student okay I will repeat just you have to to make this activity okay just draw a case study for Hospital management system later on I also send on a uh assignment okay uh C case study in Nursery PL this is a customer uh this is a nursery management system okay plan Nursery System case study once again I repeat customers plants and nutrients okay I already I uh explain about this okay uh in a nursery the plants are sold to the customers these plants are flowering and not fling only nutrients are given in the plants with some nutrients include pesticides and watering and man that's why is a nutrients nutrients can be to pesticides watching and manual okay is a plant is flowering or nonflowering okay this is a um all about the nursery management system and you have to make a case study of Hospital management system okay uh description is recorded a patient is admitted to a room which has certain category having fixed change per day okay the given case study is of uh Surya Hospital means name of hospital is suria Hospital which has decided to computerize their operations from the specialization listed above we identify entity sets and their attributes also thus enti entity sets Des design of Life hospitals that is nothing but the see here how many entities are there present here in this guest stud uh we have to take doctor patient visiting category room admission details and accident information if any accident Cas is there then that accident information is um now see your doctor okay doctor is one entity and this doctor entity consist of these are the attributes means doctor number Doctor name doctor address and Doctor specialization and Doctor type is there for means doctor entity can consist of these attributes and patient patient patient table or patient um entity uh patient entity consist of these are the attributes patient patient name patient gender patient address and patient uh number after visiting schedule okay visiting schedule is a third entity means we have to create third table in our database record ID why we have to create this because storing data into this we have to create a entity and record ID do ID day from time to time okay this category uh category ID category name CH for room customer ID room number room description okay AC non AC Etc okay afterward uh or private General Etc in hospital management system admission Detail Doctor ID patient ID admission ID take cuse of admissions okay afterward accident information is there accident record ID admission ID police booklet number name of police accident description if accident case is there then these are the entity present in in this ER diagram uh of Hospital Management Systems okay um just you have to draw a diagram for this I explain all about this and this is activity for you and now we will see relationship Set uh design designation of Life Hospital okay relationship set designation of Life Hospital okay this is a relationship of Life Hospital and this is about uh this is also about a Life Hospital uh doctor has many visiting schedules doctors and visiting schedulers are related by one to many relationship doctors looks after patients doctors and patients are related to many many to many relationship patients has admission details patient and AD admission details are related by one to one relationship admitt admission uh details has admission information admission details and admission information aisss are related by one to one relationship now room uses admission details room and admission details are related by many to many relationship and room has category room and category are related to many to one relationship using the above entity set and relationship set we draw the following a diagram that is primary or candidate key are shown in the diagram with underline okay primary candidate key sh uh with the underlines okay this is a uh Hospital management system diagram now you have to draw uh here diagram about the hospital management system this is a activity for you see here these are the entity relationship ER model for various case study okay engineering College admission process okay mean student the sub student number name marks detail qualification passing years okay there are one student having one application form okay and one student having one Mark list one student can take admission into the one particular College that's why one to one relationship is there and one students are having many colle Choice okay that's why one to many relationship is here between these two entity okay this is all about engineering engineering College admission system or any College admission system here diagram just see okay about this ER diagram and uh I will give one activity for soling that is draw the ER diagram for Hospital management system now today we will see this is online hotel reservation system can see here customer reservation hotel in one hotel many employees are there and in one hotel many rooms are there and one customer um makes a many reservation payment type of payment these are the entities here customer reservation hotel okay and payment employ room these are the entity One customer can choose a many payment modes that is

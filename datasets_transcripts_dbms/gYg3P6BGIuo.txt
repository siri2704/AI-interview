as we all know dbms is one of the most used concept so keep that in our mind we came up with the tutorial where we are going to work with the end-to-end project for broadband database management system before start the tutorial let me introduce that great learning has come up with the brilliant idea that is great learning academy where you will get almost 80 plus free courses and after complete your course you can claim your certificate as well and if you want to do these courses in your mobile application that is also possible using great learning app so let's get start with the tutorial now we are going to start with the project what project we are going to do we are going to do a um you can say very interesting project that broadband database management system so there will be a proper broadband management database you will have your um you know customers you will have your broadband connections you will have your package and we are going to talk about all these things right and what we are going to do i will show you how can you make your your diagram in mysql workbench right i hope you are interested to learn the project and we will solve some queries with the questions as well to understand how the whole concepts we have learned so far how it's gonna work right so let's go to mysql workbench and let's have a look at how we can start with this project now we are going to talk about a one project using mysql that is broadband database management system before start the project i will show you in the mysql workbench how can you see your your diagram in mysql workbench as well so let's get start with the project so for this project i am going to make my own uh first or you know i am going to make the sql script a new sql script because we are going to do a huge database and this time i don't want to make this uh like you know the before whatever we have done i just want to use all of them and i just don't want that our uh database will be a mixed up one right so here what i did i just created a database called internet right uh i have created before as well so what i did okay so what i did i just said hey i just want to drop my database so i will start from the scratch what i am going to do i am going to write create database and my database call will be uh the database name will be internet right let me just execute that we all familiar with this uh command as we have learned so many things in mysql so first anything you have to start with you need to create your database right so this will be like a uh you know recap for you guys and um it will help you to understand how you can start from a scratch to make a whole total database right so i have created my database now what i need to use i said hey i have created a database called internet and now use internet only right let me just do that yes now it's gonna use the internet database now if we want to see how many databases we have show databases right the way we write and then semicolon don't forget to put the semicolon again right now you can see we have lots of database like abc abc2 bmsdb uh let's just uh scroll it down you will see the other databases as well you can see internet database is also there so your database is created and in use you can start creating your tables now uh as we have done about joint table we did some uh tables right we make some tables now what we are going to do i just want to see uh the ear diagram for that particular database right how can you do that uh so if you want you can go to that particular sql script and i have used use my final one if i am not wrong yeah it's gonna use my this database and now what i need to do go to database right then reverse engineer go to reverse engineer wait for few seconds it's gonna take some time uh from there you need to you can see my host name is 127.0 port is 3306. some of the cases if you change your port be sure that okay i have changed my port and this is my port number you have to very sure about all these things and your user my username is root name and if you have changed your username put that right then uh press next you can see it's just gonna ask you your password for my case one two three four five six seven eight my password your password is uh like you can save your password whatever the whenever you are going to install so i have shown you in the installation process then that time you have to give a password so whatever password you are going to give you need to remember that right so my username is root and password is one two three four five six seven eight okay then okay yeah it's gonna take few time yes retrieve schema list from database check common server configuration issue issues everything is done go next and you can see your database leaves the the all the database you have so i am going to use okay my database name was my final database where is it i am not gonna get that okay let me just go down okay my demo final one this is my database name right then go to next and you can see next check result okay uh okay right then execute let me just it's gonna take few time to make the year diagram it's already there two tables two views from idea final one right we have two tables and two demos right if you can look at here where is my fav yeah can you see the relationship we have this data of customers and account they both have can you see this whatever we have talked about one too many one to one right can you see this this is something the symbols we have over here if i can make it bigger no i cannot so these are two views these are not tables right so we have talked about the tables and the views so yes this is about the views and the tables now we are going to see what are the tables we are going to make in this uh database called internet right so in our um database we have already created a database called internet how you can create that creating create database and then you have to give the name of your database so for case of this database i have named it as internet and then again we are going to use use internet why we are using this in notepad because i just want to understand make you understand what are the table and what are the attributes we are going to use and from there we will make our ear diagram and why we are doing this first here we are going to make the table uh so already i have done the year diagram for this so as i just want to show you how can you make your diagram using um mysql workbench right we have done for one a small uh you know database but here we are going to do for the uh full database the database we are going to make called internet for broadband management system right so here we are going to make a table called customer in this table we are going to have few attributes what are those few attributes we are going to have customer id uh first name uh then last name birthdate join date uh ct state street main phone number secondary phone number fax like if you have fax then fax monthly discount package id so here customer id is a type of integer first name is a type of vaca last name is a type of worker and the length will be 25 birthday is a birthday is also type of where can you can make it date as well uh join date is a type of date city is also work at state is also where street is a type of backer and the length is 40 main phone number will be bearcat 12 with the uh like the code 10 plus two numbers of digit code then you will have secondary phone number that is also 12 will be bad cat you can make it in as well if you want and if you want to make a plus sign so you need to go for using bracket then we have fax market 12 and monthly discount uh that will be in decimal it can be float value right decimal value so decimal four comma two two is basically your basically the after point whatever the like digit you can have then package id that is is it right and here we have the inserting customer values so right uh what we need to write insert into what uh insert into customers then values then you have put down all the records you have be sure you maintain the proper sequence you have maintained when you make the table all the time if you don't make the proper sequence then you will get an error we will do all these things in my sql workbench as well now we will move and we will see what else what other tables we have in this so here here we have creatable package so one table we are going to make called package where we are going to have id i mean attributes called package id that is integer speed of your package that will be back i start date when you start the package that will be date format then we will have monthly payment the payment of like the payment you need to do monthly if you take the that particular package then it will be integer then we will have sector id so a sector id will be it right now again we are going to insert this values into package table we are going to make this uh like first we are going to discuss all the tables we have in this database then we will go to mysql workbench and we will execute all these commands right now if you come down then we will have a table called sector right in the sector table we have only two attributes one is sector id that is int and second one is a sector name right that will be back acting okay now uh if you want to insert them insert sector values one comma private so sector id is one sector name is private right and some of the cases sector can be business as well uh like the way we use uh broadband connection for private and for business purposes is it for business purposes then it will be different right now we are going to talk about the table called pack grades so like your grade of your package right there will be grade id will be there grade name will be there minimum price maximum price and if you can look it into this we have inserted one the grade name is basically very low yeah sorry great id will be one great name is very low uh minimum price is zero maximum my price is still right uh in the case of uh second one you can see it's too it's low 11 to 20 then medium 21 to 40 then high 41 to 80 then very high 81 to 150 right so these are the table we are going to have so now let's go to mysql workbench and let's have a look at how we can execute these commands and then we will have a lots of query to solve right we will come back here we will do all the basic commands we have used over there uh we will do that we will see our tables we will see our databases and all the like you know select star from the table names i mean fetching all the data from the tables and then we will do all these queries to understand the concepts we have learned so far so let's go to mysql workbench now we come to um mysql workbench we are going to create a database if we have this database already internet let me just drop it yes so again we are if you are going to create a database then we need to write create a database and the database name is internet over here let me just create it yes now i said hey i have created internet database now i just want to use that particular internet database let me just do that yes so i am going to use this internet only now if you want to see how many databases you have you again need to write show databases so you can see i have lots of databases and in that we i have internet as well now what i need to do now we are going to create a table called customer that we have seen uh before right so let me just create it we know what are the attributes we are going to use over here let me just execute this yes right it's running and this is already done now what we are going to do we are going to insert all the values for this particular table okay i have already written down all these things because otherwise it's gonna take a lot of time to write it and in the later in this section we will see how can you import uh how can you use excel sheet as well right okay so you can see we have already inserted all the values now let me just write select star from customer so why do we use refrigerator we use select star because to get all the data from your particular table okay it's giving me okay it's customers okay so always be sure whatever the table name you are using yes can you see your customer id first name last name birthday joined it ct state street everything is there your attributes and all the details are already inserted right now we are going to create the table called package right let me just execute this yes and i am going to insert all the values in the package table so if you talk about in this package and this customer will be your entity right according to the er diagram right okay we have lots of package okay let me just do that yes it's getting inserted yes it's already inserted let me just write select star from packages just to check all the um you know all the values or all the data we have inserted it's in inserted or not yes it's inserted already if you look at it we have speech 750 kbps start date is 201 to 512 up monthly 79 sector id one can you see this this is the package ids this then speed uh then started monthly payment and sector id now we are going to talk about creating a table called sectors so if i execute this and we only have two sectors maybe one is for private one is for business so it's already there again if you want to see that it is already inserted to your sector table or not so let's start from sectors i will always suggest you to after create a table check that table is created or not then after inserting the value always write the basic command that select star from that particular table to check whatever the data you have inserted it's already inserted or not right so you can see for our uh like sector it's already private and business is already there now what we need to do we need to create one more table called package grades right and here yes we are going to insert all the values to pad grids let me execute this yes uh it's already there i have written down over here that for the select star yes you can see our all the values is got inserted great id grade name mean price max price so if you have all the uh you know all the values all the tables so then you can write this now i am going to say hey show me all the tables i have in my database let me just execute this can you see we have customer package creates packages and sectors the food table now if you want to see the ear diagram because i don't use any uh you know constraints so in that case if you want to just see that what ear diagram you get so for that you need to go to database from there you have to go to reverse engineer and you can see you need to go for next you need to give your password we have talked about that what is your password will be so yeah for my case one two three four five six seven eight and then next then you have to mention which database you want to go for right i have lots of databases maybe here where is my internet yeah can you see this is my internet then next the next okay okay why this next is okay then next and then you can see four total objects four selected okay execute let's check how we are going to get your your diagram the next finish can you see if you can look at it this all this you know this is your year diagram sectors packages and package grades right your customers these are all your entities and if as we didn't mention any um you know primary key and foreign key concept so we just don't get any relation over here can you see right so this is how you can go for your ear diagram so if you already have you can see your diagram is already there eer diagram over here in the mysql so in my sql as well you can make your inner diagram right okay so we came back to our so now we are going to solve few queries why we are going to do solve queries to understand these concepts more easily so here we are going to first look at the query and then we will solve that to mysql workbench so what first query we got uh in the first query is saying hey uh create a query to display the customer number first name last name primary phone number secondary phone number and package number from customer table right let's go back to my sql workbench right so what they say creates a query to display the customer number first name last name primary for primary phone number secondary phone number what you need to write you are you don't need to get all the data from customer table so basically it already said you need to have customer id first name last name main phone number and secondary phone number and package id right from customers so you need to write select can you see select customer id your first name your last name main phone number secondary phone number package id and from customer right so you can see all of them is there okay right so this is the very basic one this is the fetching the data according to like the using the attributes now let's go to that notepad and let's see what we have for the next query so here we are going to say hey create a query to display first name last name joined it monthly discount monthly discount after an addition of 20 and uh monthly discount after reduction of 20 from customer table how can we do that yes you need to do some of the mathematical uh you know computation over here all right we are going to talk about this again so i have already done this um solution and we will talk about this solution again just a second let me just uh take this up okay so these are the basic thing you can do with mysql this is i cannot make it more uh okay so you can see what they say query just break the query first what they say first you need to have first name so i said select i have first name then they said you need to have last name yes i have selected last name then since they said you need to have joined it i said okay i have joined it then they said you have monthly discount i said okay i got the monthly discount from there they said okay now as you said you are okay with everything now i make it more uh you know more complex how can we do that monthly discount after an addition of 20 so what you will do so twenty percent is zero point two two uh twenty by hundred that is zero point two just write monthly discount into zero point two as discount right then it's already said uh an addition of twenty percent and monthly discount after a reduction of 20 percent so what you will do monthly discount minus 0.2 that is 20 by 100 one member is into into 0.2 1 will be minus 0.2 as reduction from customers and let me just execute this particular query so in the query itself you can do mathematical computation as well just to do all this because to make you understand how you can do the query how can do the manipulation how can you do the mathematical computation as well if you can look over here we got first name we got last name join date a monthly discount discount and reduction can you see we got it so your monthly discount is 6 and discount is 1.2 reduction is 5.80 right so this is how we can do the mathematical computation so i hope you understand this how you can do that let's go to the next query and let's have a look at what we have next right so why we are doing this okay let me just do that so we have few more queries almost 20 25 queries we are going to solve in this and we will try to understand how we can do this different type of data manipulation part data fetching part and you know from the data itself you can get some other you can make some other attributes right just a way we did like discount and reduction we did not have this in our table but we can make it using some mathematical computations as well so what we have right now let's see create a query to display the package number okay speed start date the date being the package become available right so start it is something that okay when the package become available then monthly payment and monthly okay then monthly payment then monthly payment into 12 right so yearly payment you can say name the last column as a yearly payment as we talked right you can see it it's first saying okay give the monthly payment and i just want to see the yearly payment as well so you will get it from package table let's do it right how to do it select packet id okay uh then they ask for speed then they ask for start date then they ask for monthly payments right then they ask for monthly payment into 12. you can directly write monthly women into 12 then you need to give a allies the allies concept we have learned as they said you need to give hay as yearly payments so you need to write as that particular attribute name as yearly payment from where from packages right so this is how we are going to use the concepts uh solely slowly we are trying to use those concepts we have learned so far in the tutorial yes can you see that packet id is their speed is their start date is their monthly payment is there uh yearly payment is also there and okay okay let me just execute this once more okay monthly payment is there yearly payment is also there that is 9 9 48 79 into 12 obviously equals to 948 right so this is how we are like solving this queries ah now let's see what else we have okay so here we are going to talk about create a query to display the last name of okay let me just copy this and go back to mysql and try to evaluate what they are saying create a query to display the last name uh concatenated with the first name separated by space and main phone number uh concatenated with uh a secondary phone number separated by comma and space oh my god there are lots of things we need to do name the column uh heading full name and contact details respectively customer channel oh my god let's let's let's break this out first first what this is create a query to display last name concatenate with first name so first your last name will came then you have to concatenate that with first name but there will be a comma separated value right sorry they have to be separated by space okay first last name then first name and you have to name them as what full name right then you have to contact so concat is basically we used to add two different attributes then you said okay your main phone number then comma separated value the secondary phone number that will be as contact details from customers right uh so what we did select contact is a full function you call function call concat then the round bracket you say first last name then you have to break them or may separate them use space right in the yes in the you know okay yes we have done we have write the space over here if you can look at it let me just make it big yes contact last name then space then first name right then that is known as full name you can write as or you can just directly write foreign right for the case of main phone number again we are using contact okay it's got okay contact then we have written the main phone number then i said you it will be have a comma separated value comma and then secondary phone number and then it's known as contact details that attribute name will be contact details all of the attributes we are making over here right can you see full name smith alvin so if you say it as we always write as you can write as if you don't want to write then also it's a way of doing okay all that all the time you need to write you don't need to write as for a license you can directly name the attribute as well right it said sleep alvin and then contact number is this then john's shows and then the contact details is this then uh williams stewart and then the contact number the two contact number is like this so this is how our concatenate concatenate function box right now we are going to talk about the seven query uh let me just create okay let me do that let me just create three four at a time so we do not need to pin back every time and try to copy and paste it okay right uh okay whereas we are let me just try this out okay six uh six now we will start from seven if you can look at it uh like the commenting so our questions are our comments like they are not going to um like you know execute my question so in that case i have used this particular symbol right so this is how you can comment your data on mysql workbench now what we need to do we say create a query to display unique cities from the customer table so you want to see what are the cities you have in your customer table to get the unique cities or to get the you know like particular distinct cities you need to use a function called distance we have talked about earlier as well so if you write select and then if you call the distance function and the attribute the particular attribute you want to be unique to see what are the unique uh attribute values you have so you need to write distinct then ct then from customers right so this is how you are going to get all the ct and if you can write i don't know it's gonna take or not right it's gonna give us either okay after distinct maybe we can write i don't think it's gonna take because at any way to give you more no it's not gonna it's like normal distance only it will give the city right so no so basically we can write one thing uh okay i can show you how can we do that select count cd right from customers right and can i use to function over here yes we can i just want to show you the difference right can you see it's 20 and if we use distinct how much it is also 20 oh my god okay so we have all the distinct value itself no repeated value okay so yeah if you can look at it you can see all the city we got that is distinct there is no uh you know yes there is no repetition so distinct function is basically going to give you all the value that is distinct that is unique in your table there will be no repeated value will be there now we are going to talk about a new query create a query to display unique states from the customer table now you see all the cities now you want to see all the state right then what you need to do again right select then distinct then your attribute called state okay from customers so you will get all the distinct state from your customer table can you see all the state you got yes so this is how our distinct function works with the to get in order to get the unique value from your attributes now we are going to talk about create a query to display unique combination of cities and state from customer table now i want combination of city and state as a combo of city and states from customers right but that will be distinct okay not like hey i want the combo of ctn state uh but that will be in a repeated way no so you are going to use two function at a time you are going to use the sting function you are going to use concat function right so here what we are going to do we are going to write fillet distinct function then concat your function with ct there will be a space in between and then state as combo as is your allies right your like attribute name will be combo from where from customers can you see new york new york los angeles california chicago illinois illinois okay uh austin texas right philadelphia uh and so on right so this is how we got it so this is how we got the city we got the state okay right now we are going to talk about create a query to display the last name concatenated with state separated by space i know it's like making weird combinations but yes it's always try to like i will always try to make you understand how this function are going to work and how you can use them and you can like match them and you can separate them using comma or space right yes how can we do that just write select then called contact function then what they say last name concatenate with state so last name then comma space and then your state attribute that will be known as customer and state you can write as as well otherwise you can skip it from customers let me just execute this can you see smith is from new york johnson's from california taylor is from uh illinois and williams is from texas right so this is how you can create these queries right and we will do few more queries on this uh database management system to understand these concepts more well now we are going to talk about the next query we have create a query to display the first name last name market discount and ct uh name concatenated with street separated by space name the column headings if n alien dc and full address respectively from customer table right okay so here what we need to do right let me just try this out okay can you see first we have written contact first function first name then give a space last name give a space monthly discount then gives a space then right city the city of belonging then space then street that will be as now we are going to use few more allies for one cap contacts right as fm ln dc and full address that too is from customers let's just have a look at how can you use one concatenate function and you will give lots of allies for them can you see we got the result okay let me just go here can you see as we have written f and alien dc and full address full name last name the free and full address right so this is how you can use a big lies for a full uh concatenate right for for a full concatenate result you got from your attributes in the table right so you can see you have first name last name monthly discount ct street and that to the name will be for the elias is if name ellen defeat and full address right yes now again we will go back to our question part and let's see we will answer few of them again okay from 12 uh to take okay take till team okay right oh no okay uh let me just take this again from here um where would be um okay so we have completed till okay it's confusing actually eleven so we need to take it from twelve let me just stick all of them first okay so take till 12 again okay now what we are going to do right we did till this part right um yes now we are going to talk about this 12th one that create a query to display uniquely monthly discount from customer table again if you do need to do unique one you need to use distinct functions select distinct monthly discount from customers right let me just execute this can you see we have what monthly discount we have 28 and if you just write i think here it will be different monthly discount from customers can you see this are all these things you have 28 if they're in repeated yes 28 is there let's have a count of this so you will understand the difference between them okay let me just count is 16 for distinct value let's see what will be the count 13 so can you see this count of multi discount without distinct is 16 and count of distinct of monthly discount is 13 so this is how your unique values comes if you use distinct function so in the query itself they say they want all the unique monthly discounts in customer table now we are going to do one more query create a query to display unique packages that is packet id in customer table if you again need to you like display unique packages you need to write select distinct then package id from customers right let me just execute this can you see package id yes this is all the distance package id you have right if we are going to do the same thing select count and if we are going to write pack id from customers 20 can you see that and if we do the distinct function and then count so if you can look closely you can use two function at a time for one attribute right so this is why we are doing it it's 12 it was here it was 20 here it is 12 so your distinct count of package id is 12. now we are going to use the where clause exercise right how we can do this where class conditions so where clause condition for first question we have display the first name last name package number for all customers now now the streaks will be there that package number of all customer whose last name is king so you want all the customer whose last name is king how can you do that so in that case what you need to write select first name last name package id from customers where you are going to put that where condition the way we used to write where clause where lower right lower last name so why do we make lower last name so we are making our last name to lower when we are writing key so i just don't want uh like my uh query to be confused with the capital letter and the small letter so i said lower make it my last name lower as when my last name is equals to king king is basically the lower life in you know in the small letter we have written k can you see there is no particular name in my customer table whose last name is king so before that let's just write select last name from customers smith we have we have jones williams uh we have good written watson what else if i write whatsapp maybe we will get one okay can you see we got one record when we write watson so basically whenever you are going to put where clause if your condition is not matching it is going to give you null values right it's not gonna give you any yes okay it's not gonna give you any like you know answer for that or your query is like hey i have no condition matching with your query now we are going to say display all the data from packages stable from packages whose speed is 5 mpps right so i want to see all the packages whose speed is is equals to 5 mbps right okay so for that what i need to write select uh before that let's just write that this one select star from packages can you see we have package id speed start date monthly payment and sector id right and the for speed we have 750 kbps 1.5 2.5 5 mbps right let me just try this out how much we have yes all the speed we got that is 5 mbps right total or you can say where lower speed is equals to 5 mbps right so why make it lower again it will make everything you know uh small later and there will be no problem for when you have use this for a capital or like if you can look at it a means capital b ps is uh lower so in this case i make it all lower okay so this is just a no confusion not just not if you are be sure that you are not missing any value because of this capital and small data all right so this is how we are going to get all the speed of 5 mbps now we are going to talk about the sec third one display the first name last name package number and monthly discount for all customer with monthly discount less than 30 right when your monthly discount is less than 30 uh okay so here what we need to do again i just want to print all the data we have in a customer we execute that okay it will be customers every time i'm reading writing up uh misspelled uh table name and i'm getting here wow okay so can you see we have customer id first name last name uh monthly discount will be there right that is less than 30 i say okay whenever your monthly discount is less than 30 i just want that record how to do that just whatever the attribute you want select first name last name package id monthly discount from customers where monthly discount is less than 30. can you see we got everything like i'll be in juice towards all of them market discount is 28 12 17 11. now if we can make it greater than 30. can you see there is no uh records you have that is greater than 30 or greater than is equals to 30. can you see you have uh greater than monthly greater than on you don't have anything greater than but you have equals to 30 her land and hustle right you have two records for that so this is how you can use this two operator at a time again right now we are going to look at some few queries again uh that we are going to do with the using of the same uh database management system right so now here we have a question called display all the data from customer table for all customers who joined the company uh before january 1st 2007. so how can you do that right so these are the very basic data manipulation by just to do that to understand this manipulation technique more well right so now what we are going to do they are saying feature all the data for customer table uh for the customers who joined the company before january 1st 2007. so your uh condition will be okay when your join date is equals to 20170101 right this is the format sql maintains for date right so yeah uh so you want this this uh like you know the employee for this table who joined uh 1st january 2007 so what you will write you will write select start you want all the data information uh so select star from customers by join date uh before that maybe we can again uh just try to fetch all the data to check uh what is the joining date and how we have used this customers right so here we just need to execute that yes can you see this and the joining there is this 2 0 1 2 0 5 1 2 right this is the way of writing the you know joining date now as i say the first january i just won't till the first january the only the first january so there is no there is no employee we have or sorry there is no customers we have who has joined it is 2017 uh first january right uh so if we go back to here and if we just check that what we have maybe we have 2012 so if i can write 2012 and maybe 0 5 and then 1 2 right okay so let me just check this out if it's gonna work then we will understand yes you can see all of them all the contacts we have the join data we have is 20120512 right so yes this is how your where conditions is gonna work right now what we have next we have display the customer's number first name state city and package number for all customers right but there is a condition whose package number equals to 28 28 uh 21 28 or 14 uh this will get from customer table so as we have talked about in operator in operator right so what do you say hey i want to get all the data of customer id first name last name state cd package id from customers where package id write your package id in when you say it in it will just go for 21 28 and 14 as we have already mentioned if you use between it will start searching for 21 to 18 18 to 14 right i mean 14 to 21 21 to 18 this is how it's gonna work but as you said in it will just specifically go for 21 28 and 14 again we have no records for this if i am gonna write select star from customers all right i'm gonna write that let me just execute this command and let's have a look at what we have uh so pack id as we talked about let me just scroll it down here a little bit yes we have 18 we have 31 okay so if i write over here 18 and if i write it 31 right what else we have uh we have 13 as well let me just check this out okay now if we go and execute this command let's see what is going to give oh god no okay so let me just check what is going to give us yes it's give us the idea i mean if you can look at only 18 is there 13 is there 31 is there other than that no contact details or no data is given over here so when you have used in so in basically in in what will happen it will give you that particular uh like numeric values or whatever the values you have mentioned right so this is how this inbox like if you start working with this mode and if you start exploring new queries there are lots of sites and we do have lots of courses on sql uh maybe if you start solving more sql problems that time maybe you will getting to understand okay these are the operators and how we can manipulate them how can we use this mix and match as well i mean we use two function at a time for one attribute and we try to figure it out one particular result so you can understand that using lots of uh functions and same in the same attribute you can actually manipulate your data as well right now what we are going to do we are going to go for display the customer number first name state city and package number for all customers let me just call it down all customer whose package number is not equals to 2017 or 3. so this is a trick when we say equals to when we say not equals to right so let's get back to here all right now what we say same customer id first name state city pack id from customers right where pack id not in so we have is used not now we are using both two together not in right so if i just go and do the same thing select start from customers right let me just execute this one to check what are those customers we have uh if we go in there if we scroll down so we have we do have three no we don't even have three we just have um they say 2017 or maybe i can write 23 just to understand uh 23 hours then 13 right and then maybe 39 we can use over here so these are the thing we don't want when the pack id is equals to this let me just execute that you see we all only get uh to 18 31 7 uh 1 42 37 7 34 27 31 and so on but not in um 23 39 and 13 right so whatever the data we have 23 39 and 13 we did not get it right so this is how our uh not in okay this is how our not in operators works right now what we are going to do we are going to display the last name main phone number monthly discount and package number for all the customers whose customer number 0 equals to 1 4 or 5 6 0 how can you use this 7 0 3 or 3 1 4 or 5 6 0 i mean when you have three okay and uh you are saying or right i mean you give three options right and from there we need to find it out we are going to do the same thing select last name main phone number monthly discount pack id from customers where customer id in well seven zero three three one four five six zero right so basically when we use not in when we use in i hope you understand when you say i don't want this three particular number or this for particular data i don't want that that time you need to write not in when someone's saying hey i want this particular this three numbers or particular three this three data wherever you have in your data set please feed me all the data that time you need to use in operator right okay now we have written select name main phone number monthly discount packet id from customers where customer id in three three one four and five six zero let me just execute that i don't have any customers who have this customer id in right again let me just uh select start from customers right oh it will give me all the data every time i am doing that okay i don't i only have customer id in 20 okay so i can say 13 i don't want uh i want basically here 21 and maybe okay 10 21 will not work again so maybe 16 let me just execute this what we will get here can you see we got only three answers 13 16 and i can see one more thing i want to check the customer id as well okay it's already here there is no point of writing it okay so just to make sure whatever it comes uh it's right can you see 10 13 and 16 we got not other one yes this is how our not an in operator works ah now we are going to talk about display the first name and monthly discount for all customers whose first name it's interesting uh first name ends with an e oh my god so we are going to use the pattern matching that technique what we have learnt in the before in the part of the section the like one so what i said select first name monthly discount from per customers where first name like right what it says aims week so if your if your pattern is say hey it's gonna end with so you are not going to give any percentage sign but if you say there will be somewhere you will have e in the name so that time you need to use both side percentage side because for in front of e you will get some data after e you will get some latest right so your pattern will anyway you want e in the any uh part of the first name but here it's or specify that after e there will be nothing right so this is where we have written percentage e let me just execute this josh lawrence and pasquales right so these are the person we have their names con ending with e right this is how your pattern matching works and for pattern matching we use what we use like right for pattern matching we use like command now we are going to talk about display the last name and the package number for all customers where this is again interesting where the second letter of their last name is d again if you want this data to be second later how can you do that right so in that time you need to write select last name right package id from customers well last name like underscore you have to give one for one character one particular character you have to give underscore underscore d and then percentage why first there will be something then b will be your second letter then you will have percentage after that anything can be there right let me just execute that can you see we don't have anything again i need to search for what we have and from there i need to find it out so let's start from customers let me just check this out oh my god what i have written for form okay [Music] okay so let's see maybe we have e or o or mark let me just put it out as a let's see what we will get can you see we got lots of data we got taylor davies walker watson jackson so can you see we got what we got the second letter is a the first one is underscore you said hey any letter can be there then your a the particular one the later you want after that and then percentage sign so after all percentage is basically after this pattern anything can be there i am okay with that but i want this pattern to have to be there in my results right this is how this like or pattern matching works now uh okay we are going to talk about display all the data from customer table for all customer who have the letters uh i oh sorry l j or h in their last name order the query in the descending order by monthly discount oh my god there are lots of things to do first bake the query first right select start from customer you will get all the data where you need to make everything in a small later lower last name like now what you have said like one uh it's l sorry l percentage percentage j percentage percentage h percentage percentage so whatever the name is contained with l j and h right then order by in what order order by in a monthly discount order which is also in a descending order so for descending we need to write bese so here if you look at how many we are using we are using where we are using lower function we are using like the for pattern matching we are using or we are using order by and as well as dsc right let me just execute that can you see we got it we got that where we have l we have j we have h in the last name and as well as if you look at monthly discount if we just crawl it down over here so 17 and then six and for others is null right so this is how our pattern matching with or with order by with lower function everything works together this is how you can mix and match all the concepts you have learned so far and you can just fetch your data from the database now we are going to look at the next query where they are going to say hey display the first name join date monthly discount and package number for all customers right who don't have the later a in their last name order the query okay so how we can do that so like anyway if you want to display first name join date monthly discount and package number there is nothing new but for all the customers where you need to patent election to matches the pattern right so you need to write select first name the next day asking for join date right after that they were asking for monthly discount right from there they asked for package id from where which table from customers table they say the last name should not contain a i mean anywhere a will not be there right that time if something is saying not they don't want that that time you need to use not right and with the light pattern like command which is pattern matching right so what you are going to say select first name join it monthly discount package id from customers right where lower first you will lower your last name right make them in a small lectures lower last name not like then in the quoted you need to say percentage i mean before a you can have anything after a you can have anything but a will not be there in the last name right so in that case you need to write percentage a percentage right so you got it how we do the pattern matching if it's like the only one later after a particular letter you want then you need to write underscore that later and then percentage if you say hey i want this later this particular letter to be in the last after that nothing will be there you need to write percentage then that later that's all after that nothing will be there so uh someone said i want this particular letter to be in the particular last name right a will be there after and before anything can be there so you need to write percentage a percentage right so this is how this like and pattern matching works before uh execute this query let me just write select star customers right i just want to see how many they have which has the last name so you can see in the result williams is there where a is there in the name uh then we have davies we have events we have thomas we have any other name we have watson jackson right so this name will not be there when you execute the query right can you see the 12 rows returned before the 20 rows was returning now to 12 rows why the first name is there okay i did not write the last name let me just write over here last name as you can see that right the record number of record is list that means some of the record are being you know um deleted or i mean just say no you are not for this particular query let me just do that yes smith jones brown wilson roberts johnson lewis and so on right no one has the a in their last name so this is how this like or pattern matching works now what we are going to say let's see the next query so they are saying display all the data from customer table for all customers without a package right where package number is null so basically you need to find it out the null value how can you do that same select star from customers where package id is null right and don't forget to put the semicolon okay let me just execute this nothing every customer has the value of package id let me just try this out once select star from customers okay let me just print it out yes can you see uh no you cannot like let me just scroll it down package id everyone has the package id so everyone has the package id so in that case you cannot say your package id is null so there is no uh like value it's going to return when like as we see the package id is already there for all the customers right as we can see there is no customer is without packet id so we can do one more thing just change the query using not what will happen if we use not so writing select star from customers where packet id is not null so it's gonna give you all the results where the packet id is not null for the this case we will get all the results but when you have lots of data if you want to see what are the customers with packet id is not null they are actually your customer so in that case you can use this can you see here yes all the package id is there and it's not none so this is how our not function works and how this null function works as well now we are going to see create a query to display uniquely unique month discounts in customer theory right so in this case you want to see the monthly discount in a distinct way or a unique way again you need to use texting function to see that select distinct monthly discount from where from customers right let me just execute this can you see this all then all the market discounts are there right who are distinct so if you don't say hey i don't want to see distinct i just want to see all the monthly discounts let's see what will happen so basically it's just to cross check your query is working fine or not right not all the time you can do that but as it's a very beginner time beginning time you can do that right okay again i did not write okay all our 20 rows are returning because all of them are discount monthly discounts are you know the they are not similar to each other right so in the first query they have given us the distinct one like if you have uh so for my case all the monthly discounts are same right for not for same for all the customers they are different for each of them but if you have uh any repeated monthly discount and you will say hey i just don't want to see the repeated one i want to see the distinct the unique one so that time you need to use distinct function now we are going to talk about the next query what is it let's see display the first name concatenate with the last name separated by space right and monthly discount for all customer whose monthly discount is not in the range between 20 and 30. order the query in ascending order by full name customer table oh my god there are lots of things we need to do over here so let's look at first break the query first what you need to do display the first name concatenated with last name separated by space which one we are going to use again the concat function so select contact first name space in the code then last name as full name right next what they said they say it monthly monthly uh discount for all customers so i'm gonna say monthly discount from customers right then what they say whose monthly discount is not in range between 20 and 30 okay so what you need to write back your commission is started monthly discount right monthly discount not between so we use between to get something between two range right so 10 to 12 12 to 13 right so you need to give a start range and the in range so you said where monthly discount not between 20 and 30. now they say they want all the uh like results to be in order by ascending order right so if you want to make your result in an ascending order so you need to use order by and then they say order by full name so your full name right so as you make this is as full name the new attribute right so in that case let me just execute that this is a very uh like easy query if you break this query in a part part way so you can see already there right d e g j l l m r stored right and the monthly discount is you can see not between 20 and 30. so this is how this query works right so first select contact then first name then last name like you can make it as full name then monthly discount and then you said hey my monthly discount will not be between 20 and 30. so whatever the records you have not between 20 and 30 will return me those in a ascending order by full name right so if you look at the full name you can see the first name then space the last name this is how concatenate function works right now we are going to talk about the next query display the first name concatenated with last name separated by space again the same thing the main phone number concatenated with street okay your phone number will be your main phone number will be concatenated with street then they will separate it by space and monthly discount for all customers whose monthly discount is in the range between 11 and 27 name the column heading full name contacts and dc respectively right customer table what they are asking to do that first you need to write first let's break it again break it so if you see any query in a very complicated format there are lots of things you need to do why don't you break it break by like break it and do one by one right if you need to write even two query used to query use some join use a full outer join but yes full outer join of any types of join you can use but but first break the query right so display the first name concurrently the last name the same thing we are going to do select contact first name space last name as full name then we said contact uh sorry then they said concat main phone number space with street number right we did it the both is done now what they are saying then they are saying then monthly discount for all customers whose monthly discount is in the range between 11 to 27. name the column heading full name at like the allies already you need to do contact and dc respectively right so you see it already my phone number and street is concatenated right that is known as contacts now monthly discounts right the monthly discount you have then called as dc put it as dc from customers right where you are going to give the condition monthly discount between 11 and 27 right your monthly discount will be between 11 and 27. let's have a look at what what we will get as a answer can you see full name josh and jones contact is there then space then your street then dc the monthly discount that 12.00 so all of them you can see between 11 to 27 not more than uh less than 11 not more than 27. so this is how our between works right uh next jump to the next query display all data from customer table for all customers who live in new york and whose monthly discount is in the range between uh 30 and 40. so you have to have two condition one the state or the city will be new york right then the monthly discount will be between 30 and 40. you need to write select you want all the data start from customers and you are going to give two different conditions one is where lower the city first until you at the city and then check if it's new york and monthly discount you need to say between 30 and 40 and you want all these records for that let me just execute this okay there is no record such records we have let me just try this one yes if you can look over here uh let's have a look at all the city new york with monthly discount oh let me just scroll it down it's 28 right not 30 and 40. so let's have a look at what 30 and 40 you have you only have 230 right uh when you have 230 but they are not from new york right so why don't you say this is from 20 and 40 then you will get some of the results i am just doing back reverse engineering but trust me it's just like i have not uh have lots of data if you have lots of data all the query uh will match your conditions right this is how it works no this is also not coming okay why it was there in the new year ah for the kids of new york what is that range monthly discount is 28. yes uh new york is there okay first let's let's do one thing let's just try to make this a condition working out right just just write this let me just check what are the customers we have in new york right okay we have written new work so how can we get that okay let me just try this out we have alvin right and here if we write the same command let me just try this out yes we got alvin so we have alvin that if you can look at the cd is new york and the monthly discount is 30 28 right so this is how this condition works so you put that ct should be new york and monthly discount between 20 and 40 right okay now we are going to look at this query let's have a look at what this query is saying is here so they are saying display the package number speed and sector number for all packages whose sector number equals uh one that will you will get from package table so what do you need to write just a normal where clause right select package id speed sector id from packages where sector id equals to one right before that let me just print uh all the record from uh packages right so for that we need to write select star from packages right let me just do that okay i have written um okay p s k a g s why it's getting okay no database is selected okay okay i just need to use use internet right as you do not uh use which database you need to work on that is why it's giving you the error right okay now what we are going to do we are going to we were in the 20th one right yes this one now if we write select star from packages so you can see this is the sector id you have you have sector id 2 as well so if you just select it and execute this can you say you got all the result where sector id is equals to one and you got package id state and sector id right now we are going to look at the next query the next question we have display the package number state and sector number for all packages with internet speed of 5 mbps or 10 ps you will get it from package table so what you need to write select packet id speed sector id from packages then where you need to make them lower right as we know that we don't want to go for the confusion with the lower and the capital uh you know capital part right so we make it speed as low and then we save is equals to 5 mbps all lower speed is equal to 10 mbps if you look closer you can see we are going to use or right the or operator we are going to use over here so this is how we are actually using all the concepts we have learned so far we are doing all the query every time why we are doing it we why we are solving this query right because i just want you to be more uh you know more with this queries more uh practice if you start practicing this part right so you will start understanding how you can start using those concepts learning your concepts and like doing this in a proper way and doing the application is total whole different story right so in that case what we need to do we just need to solve as much query as much possible right now what we are going to write select packet id state sector id from packages where lower speed is equal to 5 mbps or lower speed is equals to 10 mps let me just execute this yes can you see we got all the speed of 5 and 10 mbps so if you are doing the same thing let's have a look at what are the mbps we have in our total table in our total records from right from packages uh let me just execute this okay so we have 750 kbps we have 1.5 mbps we have 2.5 and 5 10 12 13 uh not 1312 till 12 so we are getting only all we are getting repeat so we are getting only the records which are 5 or 10 mbps right now what we are going to do in the next question we are asking us to display the last name and the monthly deposit for all customer live in orlando right you will get this from customer table so just write select last name monthly discount from where from the customer table where again you need to make lower or if you want you can make it upper that time you need to write all the thing in a upper uh like in the capital world right then just write the city orlando right now let me just execute this what are the customers we have for all learner no customers we have so in that case maybe we can write select start from uh customers and we will pick a city from there right okay we have if i'm not wrong new york we have chicago so what we have in the table we have new york we have california uh we have texas we have arizona so if we write texas what will happen let's just straightly write texas right okay still it's giving uh okay oh why it's giving me this error uh this is just something i just write the wrong name okay it's calling the ct oh my god i can write chicago i just make the state oh my god how can i do that okay right can you see we have the last name taylor and the monthly discount is null so this is how we are using where clause where the chicago and uh the name the city name in chicago and the last name in the monthly discount of that particular customer is showing now what we are going to do we are going to solve the next query what they are asking to do display the last name and the package number for all customers whose package number equals 9 or 18. perform the exercise once using in operator once using all right so let's have a look at how we go we are going to do that right so if we write select last name package id from customer where package id in so we have used in so many times if we just execute this we have sleep that is 80 now if we just maintain the same procedure select star from uh then where customers right let me just execute this yes you have pac id uh in that case let me just do that uh we have pact id uh team 31 7 27 uh okay 39 and one okay so in that case if we write or right let me just check what we are going to get here okay uh okay sorry i just got the error let me just do this okay i just need to write it okay so we are going to repeat from the in right uh okay so as we can see we are going to use in operator over here so in that case case what we are getting we are getting the only uh smith whose packet id is 18 so if we write something 23 let's have a look at if we have something for 23 if we don't let's just uh change the number again it's just trying to understand whether the data we have in our database okay for 23 we have to we have williams we have a sun right so in is basically if we have something between 18 or 23 so that time you will get that result now display the first name uh main phone number secondary phone number for all customers without a secondary phone number right secondary phone number is null so in this case you need to get all the customer whose secondary phone number is null what you need to write select first name main phone number secondary phone number from customers where secondary phone number is null that's all right so in that case your is null uh function is gonna work over here can you see so in this case uh we have charlie's glean and uh demarcus right they have the secondary phone number as null so you have only three uh you know three part or the three records who does not have any um secondary phone number right so this is how you can use that now we are going to talk about the 24th one display the first name uh monthly discount and package id for all the customers without any monthly discount so uh we need to check if we are uh you know display the first name monthly its count and the package id for all customers without any monthly discount right so your monthly discount will be null so in that case what you need to write select first name monthly discount package id from customers where monthly discount is null right let me just execute this what we will get but you don't have any monthly discount we have all total food we have amado we have fat we have brain uh pasquel is basically they don't have any monthly discount right now we are going to jump into the stream functions for how to solve the query for string functions now we are talking about the string functions so what question we have display the customer number first name in lowercase and last name in uppercase for all customers uh whose customer number is in the range of 80 and 150 so what we are going to do over here this is exciting right select customer id and then you need to do it in the lowercase just put lower and first name then you need to do it in the upper case then upper and last name from customers where customers id between 80 and 150 right let me just do that right we don't have anything again so here i am just going to write one and two right this question maybe has they have a lot of data but we did not insert a lot of data it's taking a lot of time so yes so you can see uh for alvin the first name is in the lower case and the last name is meet is in the upper case and the customer id is one when we talk about josh that time your the first name is in the lowercase and johnson is the upper case and customer id is two right so this is how we can do that now let's go and check the next question generating email address oh my god how can you generate email address this is really interesting to do that so for all customers display last name first name and email address the email address okay the email address will be composed from the first letter of the first name concurring it with the with three first letters of last name concatenate with string at the right meal.com right for example ram kedam uh if you have then you will get rked email.com right how we are going to do that let's let's look at it it's not that complicated if you know this all those functions then you can do that right so what we are going to say we said select first name then last name then we are going to do contact how you can do the contact we are going to use substring function so what is substring function substring function is basically is going to like split your string so you said substring upper you want your first name to be in the upper ticket upper and then one comma one right then what you are going to say you are going to say substring last name one comma three as we see it in the first letter can you see uh composed from the first letter of first name so you save it will start from one it will go till one and then it said of first name and concatenate with three letters of last name so it will start from one and it will go till three then comma at the rightmail.com from customers so this is how we are going to make the email right and again the substring is basically used to take okay let me just make a simple substring for you to understand how substrings works select star uh not start select uh maybe sub cr it already came what you are going to say suppose first name you have then you are going to say from where it will start comma 1 comma 1 from where from custom okay from customers right let me just execute it can you say you got all the force later if you write over here two or three suppose we are going to write three let me execute that you get all the first three later okay if you make it upper what you will get right apart what you will get okay you will get an okay fine it's giving you a error but why it's giving the error right you need to complete it over here right and then just okay right just do that okay then also we are getting okay okay okay oh we need to write one more thing so first we need to write substring and then upper right sub str then put the first bracket then upper first name and then right then it's going to work so always remember first you need to write sub string what sub string you want then which one you want to make it upper so substring then upper the first name then it will go till one two three first character to third character can you see it's going from first to three so this is how it's going to make the at the right gmail.com or the email for all of them alvin smith you can see it will take a and smi it is taking smi ashmi at the mail then josh johns it will take jay john otherwisemail.com then if you see amado taylor it will take a t a y adrickmail.com this is why this is how you can start using substring substring is basically splitting your all the string or the character then contact is basically like contacting all the character right so this is how you can start using them now if you came to the second one then for all customers display the last name first name and email address the email address will be so you can check this one no we went there um this one we make okay so for all customers display the last name first name and email address the email address will be what they are saying something different let's see composed uh from the first later okay i need to just scroll it down will be composed from the first letter of first name concatenated with the three letters of last name concurrently the string my the rate mail.com we just did it right uh okay so here what they are going to say they are saying contact substring upper one one and then you can use this part as well minus three to three all right why we are going to say three last later this time they were saying the first three later now they are saying the last three later right let me use the minus part of the substring right then you will understand how it's gonna work let me just uh execute this part only okay so if we write it over here we just need to write select then this from where customers let me just execute this okay can you see okay before that what can we do we can say last name right let me just execute this can you see we have smith you will get i t h how you will get that so it start from minus 3 to 3 right if you write it's from minus 4 to three or minus four to four you will get the last fold character can you see mith this is how you can use the minus the negative uh string concepts we have in python like the same way you will do that right so what you need to do minus 3 to minus 3 i want the last minus 3 from customers so if you just do this so you can look at you can see a i t h a and the last one a i t h a i t h otherwise neil dot com alvin smith george john's it will be j n e s j n e s at the right gmail.com then we have amaro taylor it will a l o r gmail.com this is how we can use substring function for the negative indexing and concatenation function for contact something right now in this part we are going to talk about display the last name and the link of the last name for all customers when last names length is uh greater than nine characters how can you do that so in that case we are going to use a new uh function called name so we are going to say select last name length of last name from customers just to check if whatever the filter we have added or whatever the condition we have added it's working perfectly or not from customers well length of last name is greater than 9 let me just execute this can you see there is nothing so i can add greater than 2 right okay let me just execute this can you see the total names make john's okay we can use still five so if we can use five okay say we are going to say hey we want just a second let me just execute that we say hey we want and last name length of the last name is better than 5 then only show me the last name and the link of the last name if you can look at taylor williams wilson thomas all the last name is more than six uh more than five right so now if you put more than six then more of a like few more records will be will not come because they are uh equals to six you can see we got only one two three four five five records so williams is eight roberts is seven johnson is seven robinson is eight in is eight and jackson is seven so this is how we can use the link function now in the next query we are going to see uh okay display the first name last name main phone number and a new phone number using the replace function in this new phone number replace all uh occurrence of 515 week dollar sign okay that's little tricky let's have a look at how can we do that so they already said you need to use a function calls replace function so you said hey i want my first name uh i want the like the person's last name name phone number and now we are going to do the replacing part we are going to use replace function now what you want to replace the main phone number with what part you want to replace 515 if you have any 515 that will be replaced with dollar sign as new phone number then from where from customers let me just execute this yes can you see like my new phone number no one is replaced right so if we can say if you have uh suppose five two week dollar sign only two i want to replace let me check if it's gonna work can you see this is already replaced five to we have two three five two so josh is already replaced five two zero three three six it's already uh dollar sign 0.336 then dollar sign 2.50 so this is how we can use replace function to replace something from a particular data and you can make a new attribute from there right and we use as as the allies we know and we give this new column name as for new phone number if you don't write uh if you don't write lies let's have a look at what you will get okay you will get replaced the full name the replace mean phone number with everything so that is why we use allies to say hey i don't want uh like the full condition i have given i just want to make a new column and your new column with the phone number new phone number now next uh query we are going to do okay right in the next query um okay in the next query we are going to do display the first name last name main phone number and new phone number using the replace function right using the replace function in the new phone number replace all pre prefixes of 515 with dollar sign and only if the first three digit of the phone number contain the digit 515 replace those digit with dollar sign okay so what we are going to do now we are going to say hey select first name last name main phone number now we are going to use a case what case as we learned about case case when lift it going to take the lift right why we are going to take the lift if you look at that this you can see phone number using replace function in the new phone number replace all prefixes right all prefixes of 5.5 that is why we use lift 515 then replace main phone number 515 with dollar sign else name phone number otherwise main phone number will be paying phone number and then end right we use in the case as new phone number from customers so as we know that 5 1 5 most probably will not have so we can use 5 2 let's see what we will get over here right let's see let me just execute that and then we will break the query and i will show you how it's gonna working right uh do we get anything no fine so what we need to do we can do this part this part right let me just show you how it's going to work select then put this one right from first tumors can you see you got this and if you look at the phone number so you need to write name phone num right so you can see what actually you are getting i will show you what this list stands for can you see five six five two five two five three five eight right then what you have said if you have okay i did not change here that is why we did not get anything so now if you look at this the lift is basically from the lift you will cut it out like lift from leave from where the column name is main phone number and how much left the first two right let me just execute this can you see that alvin smith main phone number is five two's uh sorry george jones five to zero point three three six point eight three seven three that is repaired with dollar dollar zero three two six zero eight three seven three and the case of next one amardo taylor that 522.501.6331 you will get dollar dollar 2.501.6331 so this is how it's we are actually combining all the new functions if you look at this query what are all combined we combine case we combine vein we combine left function we use replace function we use as that allies part all right so first we have learned about all the uh like functions we have then what we did we did all the demo for that right from there we now we are solving all the questions and we are using all the concepts together to understand that okay this is how you can combine all the concepts if you ask me why do we need to do that but there is a difference between you know your knowledge and the experience right so your knowledge is okay you know how these things are working but you don't know how to merge them how to use them in the proper place right so this is why we are solving this part to understand how you can merge all the concepts how you can solve the problem using uh all the concepts you know till now right now we are going to do a numeric function quite how can we do that right so in this case from customer table for all customers display first name multi discount multi discount monthly discount after addition of 19.7 percent monthly discount after addition of nineteen point seven percent expressed as a whole number that is round one then monthly discount after addition of nineteen point seven percent round down to the nearest whole number floor then monthly discount of the addition of 19.7 percent round up to the nearest whole number ceiling right so if we do that how can you do that select first name from customers we will do first the first one first then monday discount from customers select monthly discount from customers how can you do the discount spots so select 1.197 into monthly discount from customers if you do that can you see you have all these things now if you want to use a round function you will get the round right so the same thing you are doing and you say 0 so basically you don't want any number after the decimal okay now if you want to use floor function you can use flow right the floor function and the same thing okay you can use them after that if you want to use ceiling function you can use the ceiling function as well right so this is how we are using all these functions and if you want to see all of them together just use all the function together and select all the functions uh let me do that for you okay if you want to convert this to one particular query you just need to do one thing right this first name first all right we are going to take the first name first then comma whatever else want i want this monthly discount let me complete uh let me just copy this monthly discount now comma what do you want what else you want y1 this part 1.19 monthly discount let me do that okay i can do that now i want this round part you can actually uh then tally all the numbers together okay now round is done then floor we want to take the floor part then we are going to take what we are going to take the last one the second part let me just completely copy this can you see we got all of them together yes this is how we are first breaking all of them and then if you want you can what you can actually make them you know one particular query so then say for alvin multi discount is 21 uh 28 then 1.197 into monthly discount is 33.5 then round it will be 4 ah then floor monthly will be 33 right and ceiling will be again 34 so this is how we can use them now we are going to talk about the next query what we have now we are going to work with the date function how can we work with a date function so the query is from customer table for all customers display the first name joined it joined at minus 10 days joined it plus one month and the date difference between join date and the current date how we can do that so first let me just execute the table details the all details the all data we have for that we need to write select start the basic query from where the customers table right let me just execute that yes so now what we are going to say as you see first name is there join date is there right so you first need to write first name joined it then you need to write date add write the date add function we have then we need to say join date from where you need to act from join date interval minus 10 days right as we said the jointed minus 10 days then the second one was date at then join date interval one month okay then take difference so current date and the join date right so first we will do that and then we will use a word we will use a uh alliance for this right let me just do that can you see i'll win the joint date 2012 512 and uh yes that ad date the interval of uh minus 10 days will be 0 to 0 5 uh so may 2nd may 2012 this is uh may june 12 june 2012 and the difference is three zero six one within a days we will get this right so if you add as allies as you can see 10 days place or you can write as one month added or here you can say at as difference all right okay i am getting one either so okay few days left you cannot put okay i can see 10 days less right and if i'm not wrong to put this right okay now i can write one month added right yes this is as difference let me just execute this can you see 10 days one month added difference before we used to get all the word all the condition we have given that will be your column so i said no my attribute name will be the name i want to give so that is seriously is one month added or difference that is from customers now we are going to use the next one what so if you look at this query we are using two particular function one is date add one is date difference so these two functions can be used uh when we talk about if you want to say hey i want in this list or 20 days lease and if you want to say okay interval of one month interval of two months you can use it add now comes a date difference so this is basically will give you the difference of date like from the current date to the join date right now we will go for the next query that display the first name birthday the age for all customer who is older than 50 right what you need to do we are going to say select first name birthday round we are going to do the round day difference of current date comma birthday so you want the date difference from current date and birth date right divided by 365 okay so you will get the age okay as age from customers where they different uh of current age and birthdays is greater than 50 into 365 right so how will do that first let me just do the first part you will understand what we are doing right you write it over here and put the semicolon so if you use that what you will get you will get the age can you say 5853 how actually we are getting this for date difference you are giving current date its gonna take okay this is today's current date from there it's gonna take the birthday the birth that you gave right so it will give you the difference in deal as we see the difference in day if we divide that into 365 we will get the years right and we make it as round because we don't want is a point the float or the decimal number and we say as age now if you look at here you can see we have written the date difference right 50 into 365 which as you can get in the day we said if it's greater than 15 to 365 then only gives us the uh data so as you can see alvin josh amado will come right let me just execute this part i hope you understand how this date manipulation is working right let me execute that yes you can see alpine 58 josh is 53 amaro is 55 mark is 50 right merlin is 59 and so on 51 60 58 so this is how we can manipulate the date function now we are going to talk about the display all the data from customers table for all customers whose birthday is today okay so if the birthday is today then uh just send me all the details how we can do that we need to write select star from customers where month of birthday is equals to month of current date right and day of birth is equals to day of current date this is how you can understand if that particular customers right if that particular customers whose birthday is today or not as you can see we do not have any customers whose birthday is today right so for the current date we use current date function if you want to get the month from the date you need to use month if you need to use date from the date you need to use t right so maybe we can say not the and part maybe we can see here let's see if we have anyone who's month is uh today's month not the day so basically when we go for the day it will see if there is okay so mark is there right oscar like birthday is 0 9 right september so as we are working with the september you can see september the mark is there but if you put this particular part you will not get the answer because the today is uh the day of any customers of the birthday of any customers is not today right so this is how we use you just if you can see if you want to you get the month you need to use month function and then you need to provide the column right and if you want to get the month of the current date you need to use again month and current date function and if you want to get the day you need to use day and birth date and day and current days right now we are going further for the next query display the first name join date and the difference in years between joined it and the current date for all customers where today have passed exactly five years since they joined the company okay so as you can see they said current so you need to use current date function again select first name birth date that you are going to say do the round of the difference current date and join date from customers where they different current date comma uh joined it equals to 5 into 365 as they say that exactly five years that is is equals to here if i'm not wrong you will not get any uh data all right maybe we can say greater than maybe we will see some of this data for that okay so if you look at here you can see that select first name and by date is okay now your rounding date difference how so current date is today's date comma joined it the join date you have that you will get in a days now divided by 365 comma zero from customers now you see it where the difference of current date comma joined it is greater than what 5 into 365 then you will get all of them in a what in a day's format right so this is how this works if you look at this uh okay you can make this as you know i don't like to see all these conditions so i always prefer to go for allies giving a particular name for a particular attribute as [Music] anniversary work experience maybe not work experience sorry the this is internet right so it will be experienced customer right okay let me just add that yes now i am going to execute the same query again so experience customer is eight eight eight eight eight as eight years right ah no one is less than is anyone is less than five years uh okay if i said greater than five years now i'm gonna say less than five years let me execute this no one is less than five years okay so all our very experienced and past customers they have now we are going to use conversion function how this conversion function works display the first name concatenate with the table with the join date last name concatenate with the monthly discount for all customers solve this exercise using cost function okay now we will see how this first functions works right now we are going to use contact the first name comma then space cast join date as can concat last name then cast monthly discount as scale from customers let's see what we will get can you see we got it as smith twenty eight point zero zero as you can see name contact with the join date and the last name content in the monthly discount right so here if you can do this cash function i mean it is like basically converting your join from date to character that is why use cast function and this cons function is known as conversion function as well so if you look at it then you can see select concat first name and then there will be uh you know there will be the space then cast joint date as can contact last name comma again there will be a space of cast monthly discount as cad from customers what we will get we will get the first name alvin with the joint date then last name smith with that monthly discount so this is how it's gonna work now what we are going to do we are going to the next file let's see what we will have from customer table for all customers whose last name start with a d or k display last name as we know how to do that we are going to say select last name from customers where you need to make them in lower and then you need to slice it right what we will use for lower to make them lower in our like small letters we need to use lower function then we are going to use substring function to slice them to for slicing them we are going to use substring then what you need to select slice the last name then how much you want to slice the one right so it's like start with adk the first one one in by a comma d comma k right so let's have a look at how it's going to work so you can see the time works right we are doing what we are actually uh making the thing more you know complicated and we are using combinations of functions so if we write over here select uh star from customers as you can see what we have they are saying only babies right let me just check as well okay i need to write customers okay okay smith is there jones is there williams is there brown is there davies evans wilson thomas but a b k is very nice if we write w what will happen then maybe we will get more few or few more uh data yes we got williams davis wilson worker wood white what's on right we have lots of w right so first what you are doing we are making it lower as there will be no problem for you know if it's your word is capital later or even lower later then you are using substring function to slice your data yes so we are using substring function then in the substring function you said what you want to slice you want to size the last name when you said how much you want to slice one comma one and then you are checking that if there is there in we are using in to check in a list of word then a b k w if they are matching with any of the alphabet then it will give you the result right now what we are going to do the second one state in um uh state in upper case contact which is with customer number right how to do that select contact now we need to do upper case you need to write upper what you need to offer uh make the capital you need to upgrade the capital uh you need to make the capital at its state then convert customer id comma how to convert what to convert cat from customers where lower substring last name one comma one in adk right okay so first these are the two uh you know these are the two conditions you have let me just execute this you have a r i may be here i can write w as well right let me just add that now how to do that now how to do that we just need to do one thing right uh you have an sql syntax either okay right let's see what we are having a problem right let me just execute this maybe i make this w in a capital one that is why we are getting the error yes right so again when you are saying lower and you give it itself w it's gonna give you the error right okay how to do that so you can see contact upper state right so state its texas right convert customer id as cad 4 from customers well uh substring though like the last condition we have used right this is the combination of two conditions so first one is uh i want the customers with the uh last name starts with adkw then what they said if you get those customers then please contact their upper state and uh with the customer id all right so in this case i am going to contact upper we are going to use three functions over here one is concat one is upper one is convert right contact to concat all the things upper to make them capital convert to converting customer id into character right this is how we are going to do that and you can see we got this right for all of them uh one for california eight one for california thirteen one is six plus fifteen uh one is texas eighteen right now the third one is join date concatenated with birthday solve this exercise using convert and in the where clause instead of using like try to define filtering condition using substring okay let's see how we can do that so again the same thing we are going to do now we are going to contact join me uh date and convert birthday to date right let me add w as well all right so we are going to contact join date with the date right so let's have a look at how to do that can you see it's already there so what you will get maybe you can add one is just not written in the you know question but maybe it's like maybe you will understand more easily how to do that so you can see we first got to join it being the birthdate right so this is how we will first get joined it and birthdays from customers again this will be your condition that lower substring last name and second the last name and then we will see it is in between a d k w or not then you will get the answer right so these are the three types of questions we have solved for one particular condition now we are going to talk about null related function or phone number report display the first name last name birthday main phone number and secondary phone number for all customers whose package number equal to 27 replace every null value in main number name phone number or in secondary phone number with any all right so what you need to write select first name right last name birthdate coalescing right what is this this we need to understand all right so how we are going to use policy so basically what you need to do maybe we are going to take and when we took it and when actually we don't you need to use it so that time we can see that now we are going to use coalesce how to do that select first name last name by day and maybe i will show you differently why we are using it right we need to write right holes then uh this is the same thing we are going to use it right i am not going to change it right how to do that ctrl c and i need to copy this okay from customers right let me just execute that can you see if there is any any value right yes can you see this is actually saying but the main phone number is for all customers whose uh number equals to 27 represent value if this every null value in main phone number e or in secondary phone number with any so basically what is going to do if there is any null values will be there then that will be replaced with the what in a value right the null will not come this will any value will come right let me just try this if there is anything in the secondary one or not right so this is why we use null values unlike coalesce right this is why we use let me just execute this yes can you see this n a and this a because we have few null values over here right and this is why we are saying okay we have few null values and that's why i want this to be like this and you say pack id equals to 27 so if it's a packet equals to 27 that time only right let me just add this as well as the outcome so i want to see if the packard equals to 27 uh so then you need to use this function to replace all the null values within it right can you see packet equals to 27 and i said hey i just want to replace all the main phone number or the secondary phone number if it's null with in a now we are going to see this next five right how we can do that they are saying display the first name last name birth date main phone number secondary phone number for all customers who was born in 1972 replace every null value in main phone number or in secondary phone number with any right how to do that okay how can we do that select first name last name birth date call us main phone number which will replace by a if there is any null value will be there then coolest set uh secondary phone number and again that will be replaced by any if there is any null value from customers where birthday equals to 1972 right let me just execute that no there is no such cases where birth date equals to 1972 so maybe we can write select star from customers so here maybe we can check so basically the condition you will get when you have a lots of data right so in this case maybe the data is less that is why we were not getting the answer right yes so when we write birth date is equals to 1962 we got two alvin smith and merlin evans okay so but there is no null value in their birthdate so if we see is there any null value for uh yes that is 1971 right 1971 so if we write over here 1971 uh maybe we will get something which will need a null value for main or secondary phone number yes for 1971 demarcus brown 1971 1202 and the call is 584 the main phone number is there for the secondary phone number it becomes amy right so this is how we do that now we will see some case function how case works from the customer table for all customer display the first name last name monthly discount and the discount rate based on this conditions if the discount is between 0 to 10 discount grade level is a if the discount between 10 11 to 20 then the discount rate level is b and if the discount is between 21 and 30 discount grade level is c for any other value this form grade level is d right so here how to do that so what we need to have select first name last name monthly discount now we are going to use case when monthly discount between 0 to 10 then a win monthly discount between 11 and 20 then the lc aimed as discount grade so the attribute name will be discount rate from customers let me just execute this part okay okay i just need to check this right let me just execute this yes can you see for alvin it is discount c for joe's juice it is uh yes sorry for josh it is b for amado it is c for elloy it is a right so this is how we use our case uh concept when we have lots of you know conditions and we try to put them in our order or in a particular uh attribute using some conditions that time you need to go for using case and case is basically uh just like you know when and between and then right we are using when function we are using between over here and and then right so we are using lots of function in one particular uh query where we are writing right now what we are going for now we are going for join so we will first start with inner join right so what they are saying customers and internet packages that customer and internet package we are going to use write a query to display first name last name package number and internet speed for all customers right so first what we need to do we just need to have a look at select start from 12 from customers right yes let me just execute that so basically we are going to uh print both the table then we will try to find out what are the new attributes we need to join so for the customer you will get first name last name uh that's all you will get but if you need packet id and speed you need to have another table so select start from packages the table name was packages right let me execute this yes so for the table uh packages you will get package id and speed so when you have packet id and speed and what will be your uh you know foreign key so as we have packet id in customers and we have packet id in packages as well we can say hey packet id can be our um like you can say it's a foreign key rights so what we need to do in that case we are going to say select c dot first name y for customer table we are giving a last uh customer alloys that will be c so basically it will help you to understand okay you want first name from customers so c dot first name c dot last name but although it in this table there is no like you know contradictory or no repeting first name so as you have customers in a first name but for the packet you don't have but some of the cases maybe both of the table you have the same column so you don't you just want to specify from which table you want which column that is why we use this allies right so c dot first name then c dot last name so you want first name for customer table last name for customer table again packet id from packages table pass speed from packages stabilize as well now we are going to write from customer c so basically you are saying hey i have uc that will be the alias of customer table so from customer c inner join package is p right so you are saying uh the packages table will have p on c dot packet id equals to p dot packet id right your foreign key um like the the the way you need to join the table okay so you can see you got first name last name packet id and speed so this is the way this whole uh joins works and we know the inner join is basically when you have both the table have the common like common data right so that time you have to uh do the inner join right okay so here as we have done the inner join you can see we got packet id speed first name and last name in a tabular format but all the attributes are not from only one table so i we already talked about what is inner join and how this is going to work right yes so they are working perfectly so in the table you got first name last name packet id and skit now we are going to talk about the next query write a query to display the first name last name package number and internet speed for all customers whose package number equals to 22 or 27. order the query in ascending order by last name right how to do that so here you can see we are going to use what right we are going to use c dot first name c dot last name c dot packet id then uh p dot speed as we know packages has the speed column then from customers right uh from customer c join packages p on c dot packet id is equals to p dot packet id this is the foreign key to join two table where we are going to use a condition that c dot packet id the customer's packet id in 22 comma 27 order by c dot last name right so what we have done so package id should be in 20 32 to 27 and this will be ordered by the last name let me just execute this and maybe after that we will break the query and we will do separately as well so if we just take this part right what we will get let me just do one by one right okay now if we do don't use the condition we see it we want first name last name packet id and we want the packet speed from customers and packages that will be close to this so you got first name last name packet right is pete right now you said if the packet id in 22 and 27 then only give me an order by why do we use order by to make our order in a sorted marine ascending or a descending as we did not mention is a default it will be our ascending order so you can see we got lino and pasqual jackson lewis uh packet id equals to 27 and speed equals to 2.5 mbps right so this is how you can use join as well as a different type of condition to filter your data to fetch your data according to your users right now what we need to do there is a next query we have internet packages and sectors right so now we say display the package number internet speed monthly payment and sector name for all packages select p dot packet id comma p dot speed comma p dot monthly payment comma is dot sector name right from packages p join sector is right uh okay before that again just uh like have the question again display the package number internet speed monthly uh payment and sector name for all the packages so package number you will get from package your table internet speed you will get from package table monthly payment and sector name you will get from sector id right uh monthly payment also you will get from package but sector name you will get from sector table so how to do that select p dot packet id so you say packet id is from package table p dots feed so basically the speed is from package table p dot monthly payment so monthly payment is from again package table is dot sector name right your sector name will be from if that will be your sector table so from packages p you say hey my allies for packages of p join sectors is like your table will be secto and is on p dot sector id is equals to age dot sector id let me just execute this one can you see you get all the data from here you got packet id speed monthly payment and sector name that could id 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight speed 750 uh monthly payment you got and sector name private or business or whatever it is all right so this is how you join two table one is packages and second one is sector now let's move on to the next question display the customer name packages package number internet speed monthly payment and sector name for all customers package and sectors stable you will get this from customer packages and sector table let's see how we can actually uh connect three table at a time you say contact uh select contact c dot first name comma c dot last name you want that as your full name as customer name right then p dot package id p dot speed p dot monthly uh payment you will get all these things from packages then sector name is dot sector name from customer c join packages p right how on p c dot packet id equals to p dot packet id then again you want to join sector so you say join sector is on p dot sector id equals to s dot sector id so you can join three table at a time as well can you see you got all of them you got a win packet id speed monthly payment and sector name right and josh is so basically that is 31 whereas the speed is 5 mbps monthly speed is 109 and second name is private you got all the data from three different table now we will look into the next query what we will have display the customer name package number internet speed monthly payment and a sector name for all customers in the business sector that you will get from customers package and sector table again you need to write if you someone saying the customer name that time you need to give the first name and the last name both so automatically you need to use the contact function c dot first name comma space c dot last name as customer name then you have written p dot packet id you will get packet id speed and monthly payment from packages table then is the sector name and from customers join packages p so your customer see is basically the alias of c then join packages p on c dot pack id is equals to p dot pack id this will be your foreign key now as you want to join sector v packages then you say sector is on p dot sector id is equals to eight dot sector id so okay you have said okay if the person is from the sector is business then please i want all the agriculture been only right so your condition is that so you make them lower and then you have written etc name equals to business let me just execute that yes you can uh you got alvin amado mark elroy lots of people right who are the business sector in his business and you got their customer name package id speech and monthly payment now let's forward to the next question display the last name first name join date package number internet speed and sector name for all customers in the private sector who joined the company in the year 2006 how to do that write select c dot last name which is from customer table c dot first name which is from customer table again seed or join date which is from again customer table p dot packet id packet ids from packages p dot speed that speed is from package feeds package table then ace dot sector name your sector name from customer c write your customer c join packages p right on c dot packet id equals to p dot packet id so your foreign key will be packet id as we know that customers and packet id can be merged using sorry join using packet id right yes right we have came to this one right okay but when we do that like uh though yes so as you can see over here the sector name for all customers in the private sector who joined the company okay who joined the company in the year 2006. so you can see uh we have again uh join two more table uh i mean we are going to join three table at a time the sector packages and the one uh customers one where we say c dot joined it equals two zero zero six and lower is.sector name equals to private if you look closer you can see we are using join date from customers and we are using sector name from sector table so we are using two different attributes from two different table and we are putting to different condition so if you are you give if you want to give two different you know two different uh condition for two different attributes which are from different different table that time you need to call the allies right so this sector name is coming from sector table and join this is coming from customer table there is no such uh you know records for that maybe we can use this as 2012 as per i remember yes like all of them are from most probably from 2012 right yes so you can see this 2012 and the sector name is private right so this is how you can start using different type of joins different type of attributes from different type of tables and different type of condition you are going to give right now we are going to use non equal non equi join what is that display the package number internet speed monthly payment and package grade for all the packages right package and package grid tables so what you need to do select p dot packet id p dot speed p dot monthly payment g dot grade mean so g is basically your packet grades so you say g dot grade name from packages p join package create uh pack grades g only uh like on p dot monthly payment between g dot mean price and g dot mix price right how to do that can you see you got it the package name i mean grade name package id uh speed monthly payment all right so yes so this is how you can use a non-equi join and you can like feed different attributes from different tables as well right now we are going to use outer join how outer join works so here we are going to use customers and internet packages so we are saying hey display the first name last name internet speed and monthly payment for all customers use your join to solve this exercise how to do that select c dot first name c dot last name again speed is from packages p dot speed p dot monthly payment then from customer c then you are saying hey i want a inner join from packages p you know packet id will be your foreign key right let me execute that can you see you got it that first name last name speed and monthly speed so you got your first name last name speed and monthly payments right okay so now we will go for the next question modify the last query to display all customers including those without any internet package okay how to do that so your customer will be your whole one okay and from the packages you all want who has the packages right so you say select c dot first name c dot last name p dot speed p dot monthly payments from customer c lift join packages p on the way we actually um done i mean the relation right you can see we got the output of first name last name speech and monthly payment right so it's sake like they already think modify last query to display the all customers including those without any internet packages right okay now what we are going to do we are going to use the next one next question is modify the last query to display all packages uh including those without any customers right so we just try to understand that who does not have customers right so in this case you need to use right joy okay as we know right join means we will get all the data from right table and the matching data from the left table right so you say c dot first name uh c dot last name p dot speed p dot monthly payment customer c you will get the matching uh data from customer table right join packages so for packages you will get all the packages details and for the primary er like for the foreign key you will have c dot packet id dot p dot pack id can you see you got the customer's details but who are matching with the packet id right can you see yes this is how our right joint works now we will see the next question modify the last query to display all packages and all customers so you want all from every one every uh table so it will be like a outer join or you can use union as well okay how to do that so select c dot first name c dot last name p dot speed p dot monthly payment from customer c then he was saying leave join this one the first one right the first way we did then you said hey i want a union then select c dot because after mysql uh certain version we cannot use you know what uh outer join um keyword do we need to use union so we said select c dot first name comma c dot last name we are going to use p dot speed p dot monthly payment from customer c right join so basically you are taking left join as well as right join so you are taking the full outer join right can you see you got all the data you got all the customer as well as all the packet id as well yes this is how we do our outer join now we are going to do cell join as we know what is self join i am not going to repeat what is self join so basically join between one table only there will be no other table what they say display the last name first name and package number for all customers who have the same package number as customer name as amaro taylor customer table right what you need to do you said hi uh i got i just need to have select c1 dot last name c1 dot first name c1 dot packet id from customer c1 join customer c2 on c1 dot packet right equals to c2 dot packet id why you have only one table but you have two different alloys right now what you have saved now you said well do our contact c2 dot first name comma space c to that last name equals to amado taylor and lore contact c1 dot first name comma space c one dot last one that is again the amaro tailor right let me just execute this you just get robert's and uh noodle packet id save it right so this is how our cell join works now we will do the last query on this project and maybe after that we go for a new project and also the last in the section we will do the how can you connect sql with python as well so display the last name first name monthly discount for all customers whose monthly discount is lower than the monthly discount of employee number of 103. how to do that select distinct distance we use basically for what we use distinct for getting the unique uh like data select distinct c one dot last name c one dot first name c one dot multi discount from customer c one join customer c2 this is a self join c1 dot multi discount uh less than c2 dot monthly discount and c2 dot customer id equals to nine right let me execute this yes you got all the data which actually going to match with your conditions right so we almost came to the end of this particular uh you know this particular project how to make a broadband connection management in the later intersection let's see let's go back to presentation let's have a look at what new project we are having and we are going to implement that too in mysql workbench in this video we have talked about how can you start with a project that is broadband database management system how you can use the mysql concepts and how can you solve your daily problems using those concepts i hope you like the video and please do let us know in the comments what you feel about that before complete the video let me introduce that great learning has come up with the idea that is great learning academy where you will get almost 80 plus free courses and after completing your course you can claim your certificate as well and if you want to do these courses in your mobile application that is also possible using great learning app thank you so much

hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channel I am reti and I'm back with another lecture in the dbms series so in the last lecture we learned about scaling of databases in this particular video we would be learning about role based access control so without any further Ado let's get started so as the name suggests role based access control so whenever we give the control to any user based on their role for our database system we use this role based Access Control mechanism now role based access control is a security system that controls that who can access a database or system based on their role in the organization So based on the specific role in a given organization we provide some excess control to the users now consider that there is a team which is working on making ID cards for the employees now for that they will need the details of the employees like first name last name and different things so we provide an access to the database to this particular team now consider that this particular team is doing some read operations on the database that is okay because they need some user details but consider if this particular team is doing some right access or doing some modification in the database that is not allowed because this is a security breach so for that particular reason only we provide some exess so instead of giving permissions directly to each user the system creates role with the specific permission and user are assigned according to these roles now for example a database administrator might create roles like DB read for reading the data and DB write for modifying the data only people people with the right role can read and change the information so we'll provide a DB read to this particular team so that it can read the details which is present in our database but we won't be providing access for the DB right now what is role so it is basically a set of permission which is associated with a job function example there could be admin there could be a manager there could be a developer in different organization so according to their job function we provide a different role to different users now coming to the permissions so these are the rights that are granted to perform certain actions such as read operation write operation delete operation so whenever we provide some rights to certain users to perform some certain actions like read operation write operation delete operation we give them permissions now coming to users these are the individuals who are assigned one or more roles now coming to the advantages so it makes it easier to manage permissions especially in big systems so whenever we want to manage permission especially in bigger systems or bigger mnc's we can use rbac now coming to the next pointer it lowers the risk of misuse by making sure users only have access to what they need for their role so if there are two user user one and user two if I given the exess for DB read user one can only perform read operations if I have given the user two as DB read as well as DB WR it can go ahead and do some modification as well as read the data so according to the role they are able to use the data they can't go ahead and misuse any data now coming to the third pointer that is it improves the security and help keep rules consistent across this system so it help us to increase the system security so this was all about role based exess control in this particular video I hope you like this video so if you like this video please hit the like button if you're someone who is new to my channel can go ahead and watch out the tech content first and if you find it useful can go ahead and subscribe also if you have not followed me on my social media handles you can go ahead and follow the links are in the description till then take care keep learning keep growing keep smiling bye all

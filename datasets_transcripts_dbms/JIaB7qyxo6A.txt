hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I will be covering generalization specialization aggregation in ER model guys I have uploaded complete dbms subject tutorials I'll provide a link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started as the complexity of data increased in late 1980s it became more and more difficult to use traditional ER model for Designing database hence some improvements or enhancements were made to existing ER model to make it able to handle complexity guys from late 1980s data is increasing day by day so it became very tough to design ER diagrams by using this existing ER model so some improvements were made to present ER model in order to handle complex data along with these improvements new Concepts were added to this existing ER model they are generalization specialization and aggregation I will explain all these three topics in detail at first I will explain what is generalization before explaining this definition I'll give an example so that you can clearly understand what is generalization for example there are two entities one is true end entity and next one is faculty entity as we know we will represent entertained rectangle so inside rectangular return Strand and inside rectangular written faculty guys entity is nothing but table name shoe identity contains various attributes like name rule number mobile number and age we need to represent attributes in ellipse attributes are nothing but column names and similarly faculty entity contains four attributes their name ID Mobile number and age guys attributes are nothing but column names gaseous name mobile number and age are common for this both entities that is strand contains name mobile number and age and as well as faculty contains name mobile number and age now what I will do is by selecting common attributes from these two entities I will create one new entity that entity name is person student is a person and faculty is a person so by using these two entities I will create one new generalized entity that entity name is person so I'm combining the student and faculty entities and I am using easier relationship just write here easy a and you need to write easy and triangle such student and faculty is a person this is entity and I am selecting common attributes from these two entities name mobile number and age attributes are common so I will add these attributes in person entity this is known as generalization this generalization will follow bottom-up approach bottom-up approach is nothing but from two entities by selecting common attributes we need to create new entity that's it this is known as generalization so generation is a process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and creating a generalized entity from it it is a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities can generalize you to a higher level entity if they have common attributes properties and attributes both are same don't get convinced next I will explain what is specialization specialization is opposite to generalization for example if you consider generalization in generalization will combine these two entities and form a single entity but whereas in specialization we will divide single entity into sub entities for example there is one person entity that personality contains name mobile number and age now what I will do is I will divide this person entity into two sub entities like student and faculty and I will add this attributes like name mobile number and age to both student and faculty and if you want you can add another attributes like ID and Rule Number whereas generation follow bottom of approach and whereas specialization follow top down approach top down approach is nothing but we will divide single entity into sub entities you can remember like this generally many people will grow from bottom to up and whereas some special people that special people will not grow from bottom to up they will fall from top to bottom so specialization is nothing but top down approach you can remember like this an entity is divided into sub entities based on their properties it is a top-down approach where higher level entity is divided into two lower level entities this is specialization and last one is aggregation aggregation in dbms is the process of combining two or more entities to form a more meaningful new entity gaussian aggregation we will comment two entities and form a single entity an aggregation is used in generalizing reports business intelligence strategical analysis and data visualization I'll give an example so that you can clearly understand what is aggregation for example there is one Training Center the training center will offer some courses like C programming Java so on so I took two entities training center and courses I am establishing relationship the relationship name is offers so Training Center will offer some courses now person want to join training institute so whenever any person want to join Training Institute he will inquiry about training issue like training institute is good or bad from how many years the training institute is present and so on he will inquiry about training institute and as well as he will inquiry about courses like what courses the training institute will provide like training issue will provide Java C plus plus and so on so person will inquiry both training center and as well as courses so what I will do is I will create one new entity by combining these two entities now this training center and courses are one entity now I am combining this training center and courses and I am creating a new entity person will inquiry trainings and run courses so I'm creating inquiry relationship inquiry and you can connect to it combining two entities to form a single meaningful entity is known as aggregation guys we call this generalization and specialization as class hierarchies with easier relationship if you consider generalization in generalization strained entity and faculty entity super classes person similarly in specialization person entity subclasses are student and faculty so in exam you may get separate question like explain class hierarchies class hierarchies are nothing but generalization and specialization with easier relationship

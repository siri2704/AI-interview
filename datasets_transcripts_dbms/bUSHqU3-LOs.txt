welcome to dbms class today we are going to discuss about the normalization so in normalization so first of all we'll discuss about the definition of normalization so normalization is a process of evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize the data redundancies and reducing the likelihood of data anomalies so means normalization is used for evaluating the table structure to minimize the data rundis and data analys so data redundancy is nothing but uh so avoiding the reputation of the data storing of reputation of the data in multiple tables and uh data anomaly is nothing but storing of irregular sets of data so whenever insert update delete operation can be done uh on a relations so that will not be perfectly uh cannot be done on a data sets so that is called Data anomaly so for reducing the data redundancies and data anomaly we are using the normalization so next we'll discuss about the stages of normal form so normalization Works through the series of stages called as a normal forms for first three stages are described as a 1 NF 2 NF 3 NF means first normal form second normal form and third normal form so in structural point of view second normal form is better than first normal form and third normal form is better than to Second normal form so next we'll discuss about the objectives of objectives or characteristics of normal form so the main objective of normalization is to ensure that each table can form the concept of well formed relation so that is each table has the following characteristics so first one each table represent the single subject only for example if you are taking student table student table must have only student data and no data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table and non- primary key attributes are dependent on the primary key attribute and each table avoid the insertion updation and deletion anomalies so next we'll discuss about the characteristics of common normal forms so first normal form so there is no repeating groups are uh stored within a table and primary key is defined so next all non primary key attributes are dependent on the primary key so next second normal form so a relation is in first normal form and there is no partial dependencies and next third normal form so it is in second normal form and no transitive dependencies and bcnf means every determinant is a candidate key so fourth NF means fourth normal form means so it is in third normal form and no independent multivalued dependent encies are existed so this is introduction about the normalization okay thank you so in next class we'll discuss about the functional dependency

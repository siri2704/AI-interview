lets understand what is a data model so,   a data model is a conceptual representation of 
data, including the relationships and constraints   that govern the data it is used to define the 
structure and organization of data in a database,   as well as how data is stored, accessed, and 
updated further, its important to note that   data models can be simple or complex, and can 
be represented using various techniques such as   entity-relationship diagrams, class diagrams, 
or data flow diagrams. they are an important   tool for data analysis, database design and 
system development, as they provide a clear   understanding of the data requirements and 
help ensure data consistency and integrity

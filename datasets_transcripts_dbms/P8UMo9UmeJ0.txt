in this video we are going to discuss about er diagram symbols are which can also be called as components entity relationship diagram er diagram is mainly useful in database design so here the first symbol is for entity entity is an object or thing which is distinguishable from other objects so entity is an object which can be distinguishable from another object so student is an entity staff is an entity so every entity has its own properties entity is represented by rectangle so within the rectangle we have to place the name of the entity let name of the entity is student for strong entity also we use this rectangle symbol strong entity means that entity uses primary key so if an entity contains some primary key then we can say that it is a strong entity so strong entity uses some key field it may be primary key or foreign key it uses key field okay now let us see about the second type of entity the second one is weak entity weak entity is represented by double rectangle symbol so within the double rectangle symbol we have to sp specify the name of the weak entity here name is dependent so weak entity means it doesn't uh use primary key so weak entity doesn't have primary key okay weak entity always depends upon the strong entity strong entity can also be called as boner entity weak entity always depends upon the strong entity weak entity doesn't use any key field weak entity doesn't use his primary key foreign key but we can use uh here dependent let dependent is the weak entity here dependent means let me have an an lic policy or any policy any policy here this dependent dependent always depends upon their father okay let here strong entity is employee so employee dependents are children's and employee wife and employee parents so here dependent is nothing but weak entity this dependent always depends upon the strong entity strong entity is nothing but dependent father or dependent husband are dependent children's okay dependent uh children okay so employee father so this is about what is weak entity weak entity always depends upon the strong entity weak entity is always represented by double rectangle symbol here weak entity is dependent dependent always depends upon father next one is attribute attribute is always represented by elip symbol if you take a student entity so student entity has various properties rule number name mocks so those are specified within the ellipse so name is nothing but an attribute of the student a property of the student next one is key attribute key attribute means if if if that entity uses primary key if entity has primary key then we have to use the uh this symbol within the ellipse symbol uh here a key means let it be some primary key we know that primary key is unique so key entity means we have to underline that attribute so rule number underline if we underline an attribute then it will become the key attribute key attribute primary key attribute are our single valued attribute single valued attribute means an attribute which has only single value per number a a person can have only one part number a person can have only one other number so par number and other number are specified here so power number underline par number underlined so ski attribute our single value attribute are specified like this within the attribute within the ellipse symbol attribute underline name of the attribute underline next one is multi-valid attribute multivalued attribute means we we use multiple ellipse symbols so multivalued attribute means if an attribute has multiple values a person can have multiple mobile numbers so within the double ellipse mobile number so mobile number is the name of the attribute now let us see the next one the next one is derived attribute derived attribute means we have to use the dashed ellipse so we have two types of attributes are there stored attribute and derived attribute so till now we have seen stored attribute this attribute key attribute single variable attribute are all our stored attributes story attribute means that attribute value is stored in the table whereas derived attribute means it is not stored in the table it is simply derived from the other attributes uh if you take yes yes is not stored in the table only data but will be stored so here is derived from the date of birth so depends upon the data but is will be calculated okay so here we need to specify the a is here okay so this is nothing but derived attribute next one is partial key partial key means we have to use ellipsim but next name of the key next under dashed line dashed line partial key means here we use this partial key in weak entity we can dt has some attributes one of the attributes should be partial key only we know that weak entity doesn't use any key field but it uses partial key but it uses partial key so that partial key is specified with the help of some dashed line like this next one is relationship relationship relationship is an association between two entities let me have two entities such as student course so student enrolled in course student enrolled in course so student is one entity course is another entity so in order to demonstrate that association we uses this relation relation is always represented within the rhombus or diamond symbol or for strong entity also we use the diamond symbol we know about what is strong entity strong entity is also called as vulnerability strong entity means it uses key field so for strong entity also we use just the diamond or ramba symbol next one is weak entity for weak entity we uses for weak entity relationship we use double rhombus are double diamond double rhombus are diamond symbol so here we know what is weak entity weak entity this is weak entity weak entity always depends upon the strong entity so in order to specify the relationship with the weak entity here we have to use a smart double diamond symbol here let weak entity is dependent dependent is the weak entity so here what is the relationship the relationship is that the relationship is policy so policy is the relationship so here we have to use the double diamond symbol let here we have employee employee employee is not weak entity employee is strong entity so here we use only one rectangle symbol next one is uh in order to demonstrate uh the relationship the association between the weak entity and this uh weak entity relationship we uses this symbol we use as uh double symbols double lines like this double double lines like this so it specifies that uh this is called as identifying relationship it specifies that weak entity relationship is 100 percent here 100 percent here weak entity always depends upon this policy so in order to demonstrate this relation here we have to use two lines or we can use one solid line and arrow simple arrow will be towards the this weak entity relationship and let us see some relationships we we have several relationships like many too many many to one one to one let us see how we can represent that many too many relationship so many too many relationship means we didn't use any arrows so it specifies many too many relationship we didn't use any arrows on either left or right side next we have many to one many to one relationship so yaro will be towards the one arrow will be towards the one here we have to use the arrow arrow will be towards this one or we can have one two one so one two one means arrows will be used towards the left side and towards the right side these are the various symbols or components which are used in the er diagram

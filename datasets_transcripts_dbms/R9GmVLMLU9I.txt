foreign based on the normalization at least one question is mandatory mandatory question of the mandatory topic is normalization okay so uh if many books websites when you see so nomination is a heavy topic it has many examples many data learning data like that so today in this video I am going to give you a simple notes about the normalization so you can learn easily okay so in this video I'm not going to explain anything about the uh type in depth and application I am going to give you a simple notes just write that all the nodes in your notebook okay read multiple terms understand it okay let's get into the topic in the first is the definition of the normalization okay normalization is the process of evaluating and correcting table structures for eliminating redundancy and inconsistency of data this is called normalization so this is the definition of the normalization okay for achieving an organization we have to apply set of rules these rules are known as yeah they are basic normal forms and advanced normal forms in the basic normal forms we have three question is first normal form also known as 1 and F okay one enough and second normal form third normal form right in the advanced normal forms we have three one is voice called normal form also known as bcnf fourth normal form and fifth normal form okay so uh for each we are going to explain with an example let's get into the first normal form okay if it does not contain multi-valued attributes that is all columns contain Atomic values so this is the definition of the M First Armor form here uh for example if you have get into the eggs so at least you need to mention multi-valued attributors monthly validated with Autumn equals these two words are the very important in the first number form okay multi-valued attributes and atomic values right and here below I have given a simple example of the uh on an F okay and this is a simple table okay uh based on employee number name salary questionable date completed your course name for MPL employee there are multi values like uh I mean um C and C plus plus so that above table is not in one and F because uh the course name for each employee the course name has multi balance so that's why it is not even f convert this table into 1 and F the below table I mean we have converting the above table into the middle like that for each employee I mean for it we have one question right we are giving C plus plus to another okay so now this table is become the first normal form okay so the relation is in I mean the relation with all the data is first number four okay this is the now getting into the second normal form so second normal form a relation is said to be 2nf if it satisfies the following properties so the second number must satisfy the four below two properties that is the relation between 1 and f that means uh relation must be satisfy all the conditions in the 1nf as well as uh it does not contain a partial functional dependency remember this word partial functional dependency is the most important in the second normal form so along with the first normal phone said along with satisfying the first normal form it does not contain the partial function dependence here right you need to mention these two points a p a b you need to mention these two points one and F and R it does not contain partial functional dependency it's important or in the second number so here we have given an example my name imply employee number surname salary question and date completed okay so the functional difference I mean employee number course name so uh in second functional dependence M into NF there is a partial functional difference so we have to decompose the relation so further above a relation we have to decompose it below to I mean employee and course okay employee number employee name and salary right so we have decomposing the two relations for the above relation right and uh same as well as course employee number course date completed since uh the about two relations are in 10 f it is satisfying the to NFL conditions right so okay and see these are these are all the simple example and the simple words about the normalization right now get into third normal form a relation is set up in 3 and F if it satisfies the following properties right a b the relation between f it means it satisfy the all the conditions in the uh to all the conditions of the plane f and it does not contain transitive dependency the transitiveness of this food is very very important in 3 and F okay so if you are going to exam in order to mention these two points relation must be into NF it does not contain Transit dependency or not 3 and F okay so the below you have given an example customer table right customer ID customer name sales personality region so the functional dependence I mean customer ID customer name as a sales personally sales person but sales person idea and region does not you know uh customer ID or customer name okay the functional dependencies yeah this uh you need to write for a more mocks okay means second functionality see so this is not satisfying the uh third normal form okay so to satisfied we need to divide the both table I mean about relation into below like salesperson salary for the sales also make a different table a name different relation and for the customer we have different relation right okay hence uh the about two relations are satisfying the are relation in three okay let's go into the normal forms like Boy Scout normal BCM so the relation was a relation was said to be BC enough if it satisfies the following properties a b the integration must be three and a half it means it satisfy all the conditions of the 3nf and that determinant must be a candidate key remember it candidate key the testimon must be candid key so here after writing this point you need to give some their basic definition of the candidate key okay a field or combination of fields use it for adding paying a single record will be called as candidate key a field or combination of fields use it for identifying a single record will be called as a candidate game okay this is the simple definition of the bcnf we need to mentioned candidate key definition so okay because it has some one condition called determine how much big candidate so in the below I am doing the simple example okay so the simple example student ID lecture subject and average okay the function elements student ID lecture has subject and average but subject has only one lecture okay subject will be reading by many shorts but subject has one lecture the above relation is using 3nf but not in bcnf okay so to satisfy the bcnf conditions we can decompose the above table into mirror relations okay first student and decomposing two student and subject for the student subject we have student ID subject and average okay first subject uh we have subject and lecture hence double two relations are satisfying are in vcnf right uh we're going to the fourth round fourth normal form a relation easy to Win 4 enough if it satisfies the following properties the relation must be bcnf it means it's satisfy all the properties and conditions of the basket oral function and as well as it does not contain multi-value dependencies remember it all T value dependencies for each normal form we have um code so that is mandatory to mention the answer okay without this you can't get any even off markers okay if you mention this these type of force I mean every normal we have worked if we mention these words you will get at least of my carbon Mark also get more foreign properties it means the relation must be in 4 NF it means it's search for all the conditions of the foreign dependency okay does not contain joint ABC if it does not contain it will be in 5 and F mostly we will use uh bcnf mostly okay mostly we will use from 1 and F to bcnf4 in real cases we will use 5 and F and 4 NF so that's why I am not giving any examples to the foreign F okay Let's uh so first we need to write the addition definition of the lower position and are all the types of the marker forms okay and first the first normal form we have one word so I I have already said every now profile has one uh important word you need to mention a important Dimension that for in the exam okay multi-evalued attributes it is important multi value networks and atomic values you need to mention it in your action okay that is first normal form and the second normal form relation must be 1 and F as well as does not contain partial functional difference it does not contain partial function this is important 14th to NF dependency does not contain transfer dependency and by going to the voice control for the relation must be in a 3nf and the determinant must be candidate key along with this we need to give a simple definition of the candidate key okay to the fourth level form the relation between foreign does not conduct multi-value dependencies right these these are a very very important to every uniform is one important code okay you need to mention for the Fifth Harmony has been far enough it does not contain joint dependency so uh to learn more about this first of all what I'm saying is just slowly watch the video and write the notes all the notes that have shown here because it is very simple alerts you didn't find anywhere okay you can't find anywhere in the websites books yeah wherever you see will they be big I am giving a very short simple notes you will get good points also right right in the low in your notes and read multiple times understanding okay uh for getting the good marks you need to mention the example for getting good marks you need to mention more examples you find anything okay so if you need more explanation just comment below next uh if possible I will try to explain you in the next section okay

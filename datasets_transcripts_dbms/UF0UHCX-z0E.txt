consider a situation you and your friend have identical things for example say same shoes with similar color and number so every time it can get confusing while identifying which shoes belong to whom eventually you will get to know but there will be confusion and sometimes you might exchange the shoes similar situation can occur with the data in database if there is redundant data that means if there is similar data we can face some issues the solution to this problem is normalization hello and welcome to my channel making it simple so in this video we will simplify the concept of normalization in the database with that we will also learn about various anomalies which are insertion anomaly deletion anomaly and updation anomaly so without wasting any time let us start after a short intro [Music] so let's start with the definition normalization is the process of removing or minimizing redundancy from a table it is quite easy to understand in the table if we have redundant or duplicate data it may cause some anomalies or problems it can affect insertion or updation or deletion of data and these problems can damage the whole database to get rid of these problems normalization process is used normalization tries to remove or reduce the redundancy of data let's try to understand redundancy in database with an example so let us understand about redundancy and its consequences consider the following example in this particular employee table we have columns like employee name department name and salary when you look closely you will see that second and fourth row of the table are identical or similar there can be two michaels working in production department both having 18 000 salary if we want to change the salary value of row 2 this will be my update query update emp set salary equals to 20 000 where employee name equals to michael but as row 2 and 4 have identical values both row will get updated so the salary value of row 4 which is now 20 000 is the wrong value this can affect the database these kind of problems and anomalies arise when there are redundancies in table majorly there are three problems that arise due to redundancy in database table first one is insertion anomaly second one is deletion anomaly and third one is updation anomaly let us first see about insertion anomaly let us consider an employee table in which we have employee id name age department id department name department head and department phone and employee id is primary key let us say we have two records id is one name is abc ages 34. department id is 7. department name is design department head is pqr and phone is one two three second employee is also working in same department he is having id2 name mno age is 27 department id seven department name is design department head is peak ur and phone is one two three so this is our table as you can see there is redundant data present in the table now we will see how the insertion anomaly can occur in this now first understand that we are storing employee details and department details in same table now let us consider a situation let's say new department is introduced in the company but the employee recruitment is yet to be done so we just have a department id department name department head and department phone but we cannot just insert this much information in the table we need to put some value in other remaining columns and as employee id is primary key it cannot be kept null so to insert details about new department we first need to recruit employees in that department unless we have employees in that department we cannot insert department data so this is what is insertion anomaly now let us see the deletion anomaly we will consider previous table of employee in this emp table there are two employees of design department and there is one employee of production department as we saw before that this table contains data of two tables one is employee and another one is department due to this we get redundant or duplicate data in our table let us say that employee xyz of production department decides to leave his job now as he will not be an employee of the company we need to delete him from the database so we apply the delete query and we delete that particular column which contains data of xyz but after we delete the data of employee xyz we have no information left about the production department when we deleted the employee data as he was the only employee in production department the department details like department id department name department head and department phone also got deleted and this is said to be the deletion anomaly now at last let us see the updation anomaly let us consider same table emp which contains information of employee and department this time we have data of six employees two employees of design department two employees of production department and two employees of r d department now consider a situation if department head of r d department is changed let's say msd is the new department head we need to do this updation to every row of employee who works in r d department in this example we need to update two rows now as the table we considered for example is very small we can easily identify which rows need updation but when it comes to real situation a company has tons of records in that situation this task can become a burden and if any road does not get updated it can cause inconsistency in database for example let us say here the value gets updated to msd but in this record the value does not get updated this will cause inconsistency department head of r d department will have two different values which definitely will give rise to many problems and this is what is updation anomaly so these problems or anomalies arise due to redundant data let us see how normalization can be used to remove the redundancy from this table solution to this problem is that we can simply divide this one table in two different tables one separate table of employee and another separate table of department we will add department id as a foreign key in the employee table now let us check if we face the anomalies so first was insertion anomaly now if new department is added to company and if it does not have any employee there is no problem in that because we can now add department data separately and whenever employees are appointed their data can be added separately to employee table second we saw was deletion anomaly now if an employee leaves the company we can delete that employee's data from database without deleting department data and last we faced updation anomaly now if the department head of some department gets updated as both tables are linked using department id we just need to update a single row in department table and this will do the job this is one example of how normalization can be used to remove the anomalies from database so in this video we learned what is normalization what is redundancy in database and also learned about different anomalies which arise due to redundant data in further videos we will try to cover various normal forms if this video helped you understand the concept please like the video and share it with others and if you want to see more videos like this one on different it concepts subscribe my channel and

I'll welcome to dedicate tanning channel so today we're going to see the SQL versus moon steal data filter so previously we discussed is clear statement one and it will give the elaborate how to do the chorus operate the police doing to insert data and how to maintain that EML ETL and this year so everything we discussed the practical session in the last videos so we can discuss in this field today we discussed about the SPL and knowing school databases so why were you on the industry's need to use the moon spirit so that will be going to see here our upcoming video system so start out session so Israel is a relational database and no it's cool is is dopeman their data model so what's the main differences between list so here the process easy to use and setup universal with their many tools and then good at high performance work florist and gooder structured data you know SQL no investment to design the models rapidly developer knife secrets and then in general first of them they spear run well on in cons time constriction to understand and design the structure of the database in his field and can be difficult to scalable this bigger delta-v see what is scalable in no skills unsuited to encrypt connect enter data technology till monitor can have slower response time is the main differences they are able to see one by one in experience here we see the diagram there are product based databases there big tables are using if I want to search our the true the data to organize the data it to debtors are stored fields are stored in rows and columns so organize the data in rows and columns but in no aspheres the data are stored in their document things but here I can't do intercommunicate between three tables like primary key and Pawnee key but in noise is no need to use the primary key important but it is to display in the dark one throwing that one like an easy to maintain and if it's the letters in the nurseries so what is a sphere SQL is typically used to insert search update delete database occurred and it still did always have three different schemas that is structure data that I can be factorized that we can create the primary key for the table underneath you want to assess the data in the table like for friendly key foreign key access so self-esteem mosque and it can a lot of things it can not limited to optimize and maintenance the databases in release database like IBM db2 MySQL database Oracle Amos SQL Server and Sybase the server listen databases reserve things are famously be discussed in last video and then what is moistness it is a chance for not only squeal or not it's fields the noosphere is a non relational DBMS data ran systems that is required for fixing the schemas and avoid the joint so in knowing skills we won't use the joints and then constraints like quarantine on a disease to scalable the data is used to distributor they're stored within human genius data storage needed this can assess different platform with the different devices in it's called the homogeneous data storage and knowing this will mainly use for big data and play time web application all right there are is a dynamic schemas inside unstructured data for example the company's like it will uses like Twitter Facebook Google Amazon but is correct there there are bikes for uses data for every single page so then no SQL database can handle the weight range of databases technologies and it is said or semi-structured it's more structured unstructured clinically effective he will implement it later in 1988 and he making it use the team of Noel school for lightweight open sourced relational databases they so no need to install no need to continue no need to use the server will start and stop so they're the lakebed components it's open source listen database so is the popular lore or less the database like Apache Cassandra Apache HBase support the a'dope Bombo DB and radish answer it there that data was used in the noise case the way for noise it's a popular with Internet like Google Facebook Amazon to do it the deal with their huge volume of data into support below by transferring the data's we could tailor our system by upgrading the existing hardware the process of expenses the district where data load on the multiple horse whenever the load increases it is called Estelle out the tell me we can assess the on a server that advantages and disadvantages but no experience advantages is really two main managed open-source quick development easy to scale up on quick setup extreme flexibility to hunt this road is difficult nanjing more than one data table unless mature less support lockup and experienced users business and no standardized reporting so these are the advantages and disadvantages of no instance here you see that diagram you can understand the SQL the lesser database systems its data it's the own table is want to current with other people this is a primary key and foreign key then again if you come to go to another table using primary key importantly so this is the I said bond to is there what I want to do later by using joins their support times so intercompany the database so here you see that cube called RNA analytical process we can forget that they would ask as we can as of the data which were we can use minutes in no spirit yes the different type of comment or film structures are using here is with the type of p-values graph document and columns to see elaborately we see their upcoming video TSA's so that√≠s are stored in the Ian values cookie by example employee ID I won't make you the impiety isn't the deployer you can assess the data values by ex single please read and evaluate find us so here we can know about the vertical scalable on our surveillance category so the tickler scalable support on a sphere or ads and against elavil is the both points here here you can know abort if either this is a database this is the point a point why but the data source port we agree I won't leave is the data like this the size you can use them more ramps and more CPU and more HP about recognizes with this single single database but it I mean if I you bow for the knowledge here it is there reason it scalable isn't the database yeah you just you can assess the replication but isn't there more than one data like this is the server once over to school up to I can use the clustering data between the question you can access you can they begin their data here it's for Asians with with the can assess the data in anywhere in any locations this the scalable you can another video or another and we can able to understand can add the more server and miss the data into one database can add the most forgot their purse or one is there I increased filter thanks 100 100 on automatically moved to their server to another one to 201 let us will automatically move to the next set of a hundred two hundred one hundred so and data comes fitted with a different as more service but in the typical we can tiara we cannot do direct it but it be improving the capacities and the hard words thank you like we can add there more servers more we can add the ramp and steep used and then the more activity like the sizes and also there also the hardware just we can add it so so what the main difference is this you can in horizontal scaling the data is causing the first than their critical terrible so it's this vertical scaling use is feels the future of noise will leaves no a database never follow their lesser models and then flat pixel column record and then alternate cause it mainly you work as a self-contained it and then object relational mapping and the data normalization and then the no complex which were like a Korean language and then query planner and the integrity joints to know need use the gritty joints and then actually but in schema phase Zulu is Hugh Murphy is used to relax the schema and then don't brought the query any sort of define ops most of the data and then heterogeneous structure of the data is the same domain with the same of that from the same at the basis can use protein inspector here understand easy to understand the difference between day is feel on noosphere the SQL is that less database no high school is there no relational database not stored there for a column and rows and columns but hehe restored their rows and columns to support a SQL queries it will support the SN quarry languages and then table rows columns but here the collection of Gihon values document bears and field based yes support iranian foreign key and their support to guests here is the field base and then no support keyframe funky and those are both triggers and then here the exam the color data storage not before a reasonable data storage but Pacific horizontal data storage and then it is supporter the vertical scale of increasing their map here support the horizontal scalable I had more servers to access the rapidly we can access any location anywhere is a distributed and then it is a yeah thermosphere theorems princes and sieves of abilities and partition tolerance here but here at the Artemis it is consistent isolation under the main difference between their SQL are noise cubes then here the example of our DBMS is the explicitly we can type this query to it to build the customer table and to get their column and row space to get the data in our database can view the document base he must and he can use the no excuse learning you know to understand the features of performance it is right relational database is low liabilities power who were and then its portability is good and it's ordered consensus over less database port data storage Optima is a huge data but here the size to be large medium shades to be large but scalability is right but here's more expensive to please learn to pay the money to increase them they'll release the here the better I know about there is still no excuse so it's good as their less data base for instance it is a distributed database and the tickle is scalable actually scalable fix it or maybe things team are here they team up they can access more and we can I use the word out when to access the steamers are no suitable for Allison declaratory twisted what I just went into store entity structure and can you store complex the police you can use the joints to work access the more their tables at a time no good for the complex is easy to the documents here you can understand their where we use the in noise will gaming social medias like this book and I wrote little supported web mobile interfaces application is supported and then data source for like kyun venues one database or column family story any experience own it's worth like right to the new intern banking we can use the data to mobility can use the transfer of money through the applications and I can access the interfaces data Mart but you can use only their lesser table structure storage product unless is using the joint to save one paper book can assess their more table you see the joints for a weekend party so better if we move through their here so here we can understand and there is fuel database like Esther server - periods Oracle on db2 on so it's the person data using the company but nowadays a the want to empower make make it into a spill database like MongoDB on Hadoop Cassandra Cassandra its support for Facebook MongoDB support like Google applications and it's good because and then the step of database are using their knowledge skills for dessert you can easy to understand the main difference between they squealed on noise fields and then how we do it applicable companies are going to make it with databases like molecule we can understand this video you can understand basic things for taste difference between these two upcoming videos we can going to see about the new skill how it can be applicable in the industries and also we can use to develop the database using the MongoDB and also the Cassandra not coming videos thank you for your attention and then thank you for giving this opportunity with you the basic things to understand of it thank you for where the variable time to us thank you

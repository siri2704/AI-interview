Hello. In this video, we will learn the fundamentals
of database, SQL (Structured Query Language), database management system, client-server architecture, relational
database management system, MSSQL and SQL Management Studio. Let's get started. What is database? A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data,
typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is controlled by a database management
system (DBMS), which, along with the applications associated with it, is referred to as a database system. Databases are designed to efficiently store, manage, modify,
update, control, and organize data. Structured Query Language (SQL) is use to writing and querying data. The primary differences between databases and spreadsheets
include the way data is stored and manipulated, who can access the data,
and the amount of data that can be stored. Databases are capable of holding much larger collections
of organized information and allow multiple users to access and query the data using complex logic and language. In simpler terms, a database is essentially
an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically on a computer system. Imagine it like a giant filing cabinet,
but instead of folders and paper, it uses digital storage and software to manage information. This structure allows for efficient
searching, sorting, and analysis of the data. Common uses of databases include e-commerce websites, social
media platforms, banking systems, and library catalogs. What is SQL? SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, 
is a domain-specific language used in programming for managing data
in relational database management systems (RDBMS)
or relational data stream management systems (RDSMS). It is designed for handling structured data
where relations exist between different entities/variables. SQL encompasses data query, manipulation (insert, update, delete), 
definition (schema creation and modification), and access control. SQL is essential for working with databases, used widely in industries
for data analysis, application development, and management. on defining and manipulating data
rather than just querying it. It’s a powerful tool for managing and organizing data
in databases, widely used in applications worldwide. Relational: SQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns,
representing records and data fields, respectively. Standardized: ANSI and ISO standardize SQL. Core commands like `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`,
`INSERT`, `WHERE` remain consistent across database systems. Scalable: SQL databases handle various data types
and large amounts of data, suitable for diverse applications from small to large-scale systems.
Queries: Retrieve specific data using conditions and filters. Schemas: Predefined structure for data,
including data types and table relationships. Transactions: Execute operations
as a single unit of work for data integrity. Data Integrity Constraints: Enforce data accuracy, reliability, and 
consistency using constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, etc. Joins: Combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns 
using various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.). What is database management system? Database Management System (DBMS) oversees structured data
collections, acting as a central hub for storage, organization, and retrieval. It facilitates: Data Creation and Management: Tools
for defining database structures and manipulating data. Data Security: Access controls
to safeguard sensitive information. Data Integrity: Enforcement of rules
to maintain accuracy and consistency. Data Retrieval: Support for query languages
like SQL to efficiently extract information. Performance Optimization: Techniques
such as indexing and caching for efficient operation. Backup and Recovery: Mechanisms
to prevent data loss and restore from backups. In essence, a DBMS manages
data storage, security, integrity, retrieval, performance, and recovery,
ensuring vital functions for users and applications. The client server architecture The Client-Server
architecture in SQL Server delineates the interaction between a client application and the server-side SQL Server
software, facilitating efficient data exchange. Client Application: The front-end interface where user interactions occur, initiating requests
to the server for operations like data retrieval or updates. Server (SQL Server): Hosts the SQL Server software, managing
client requests, and database operations. Communication Protocols: Facilitate client-server communication
over the network, including Shared Memory, TCP/IP, Named Pipes, and SQL Server Network Interface (SNI). Operation Workflow with Authentication and SQL Queries:
Client initiates request with authentication. The client application sends a request
along with authentication credentials to the SQL Server for data manipulation
or retrieval. For instance; querying username and password Upon receiving the request, the SQL Server verifies
the authentication credentials provided by the client. This ensures that only authorized users
can access the database. after successful authentication. The server parses SQL statements to understand the client's
request and executes the appropriate queries. For instance, querying a customer's orders. The SQL Server sends the query results or operation
confirmations back to the client. For instance, if querying for orders. The client application receives the response
from the SQL Server and interprets it accordingly, updating the user interface
or taking necessary actions based on the data received. Relational database management system
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that stores data in tables,
which are organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a different kind of entity,
and the columns represent attributes of those entities. The power of an RDBMS comes from its ability
to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data through relationships between tables, typically using a language
like SQL (Structured Query Language). Here’s how the example can be converted to a three-table database
involving students, courses, and their credit grades. In this structure, the Grades table acts as a junction table
that links Students and Courses through foreign keys. This allows for the association of students with the courses
they are taking and their respective grades. In a non-relational database setup, the Grades table would need to include all the details about students
and courses directly within it, leading to redundant data. Without Relational Database: The Grades table would repeat student names, course names,
and other attributes for each grade entry. With Relational Database:
The Grades table contains only the StudentID and CourseID, which point to the respective tables
without repeating the actual data. This design ensures that each piece of information is stored
only once, reducing storage space and simplifying updates. If a student’s name or a course’s details change,
you only need to update one record in the respective table, and all related entries
in the Grades table remain accurate and consistent. In summary, foreign keys in a relational database
provide a way to reference data across different tables, which prevents unnecessary repetitions
and maintains data integrity. It's a relational database management system
(RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. Imagine a digital filing cabinet where you can store
information in structured tables with rows and columns. MSSQL excels at organizing, managing, and querying
this data. Here are the common uses of MSSQL: 
Websites and applications, e-commerce platforms, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), inventory control, financial reporting, and business
intelligence (BI) and data analysis. Some key strengths of MSSQL
include providing high performance and scalability, robust security features ensuring data integrity, advanced querying
and reporting tools for effective data extraction and analysis, as well as a relatively
user-friendly interface for database management. What is SQL Server Management Studio? SQL Server Management Studio is a free tool developed
by Microsoft specifically for managing MSSQL databases. Think of it as the user interface
for interacting with your data stored in MSSQL. With SSMS, you can create, manage,
and delete databases, work with database objects like tables and stored procedures, backup and restore databases,
write and execute T-SQL queries, and generate reports. It's an essential tool for MSSQL database
administrators, developers, and data analysts. Until this stage of the training,
we have learned: What a database is. Introduced the SQL querying language
and learned its basic features. Learned what a Database Management System (DBMS) is. Learned how Database Management Systems
work with client-server architecture. Learned about relational databases and their advantages. Learned the purpose of MSSQL
and SQL Server Management Studio. In the next stage, we will install MSSQL and SQL Server
Management Studio software and write basic SQL codes. I hope you’re all enjoying our SQL training sessions so far. I wanted to inform you that our SQL training will continue in future sessions, and I’m excited
to delve deeper into this essential skill together. I understand that some of you might have been using MSSQL and SQL Server
Management Studio for completing the exercises. However, I want to assure you that for our future trainings,
there’s no need to rely solely on these specific tools. You can achieve the same functionality and practice
your SQL skills effectively using online coding platforms. Online coding platforms provide a convenient and accessible environment for practicing SQL
queries, data manipulation, and database management tasks. They offer interactive interfaces
where you can write SQL queries, execute them, and see immediate results, just like you would
in MSSQL or SQL Server Management Studio. I will be sharing resources and links to recommended online coding platforms
where you can practice SQL outside of our sessions. Feel free to explore these platforms and use them
to reinforce your learning. thank you for watching

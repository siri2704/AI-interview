namaskar gigabyte computer class is database management [Music] system introduction data model what is data model a data model is a conceptual representation of the data a structure that are required by database data model is a conceptual representation data model A conception representation dat structure data designed by a database datab the database structure includes datab structure objects the associations between data objects and the rules which govern operations of the objects to yeah rules or associations conjunction connection the association between data objects and the rules which govern operations on the objects as the name implies the data model focuses on what data is required and how it should be organized rather than what operations will be performed on the data to use a common analogy the data model is equivalent to an Architects building plans a data model is a Independence independent of Hardware data model Hardware independent or software constraints rather than try to represent the data as a database would see it the data model focuses on representing the data as the users see it in the real world it serves as a bridge between the concept that make up real world events and the processes and the physical representations of those Concepts in a database [Music] mey there are two major methodologies used to create a data model data model create in entity relationship ER approach and the object model this documents uses the entity relationship approach data modeling in the context of database design database design is defined as design The Logical and physical structure of one or more databases to accommodate the information needs of the users in an organizations for a defined set of applications the designs processes roughly follows five steps planning and Analysis conceptual design logical design physical design implementation the data model is one part of the conceptual design process the other typical is the functional model the data model focuses on what data should be stored in the database while the functional model deals with how the data is processed to put this in the context of the relational database the data model is used to design the relational table the functional model is used to design the queries which will access and perform operations on those table component of the data model of data model May component the data model gets its input from the planning and Analysis stage here the model along with analyst collects information about the requirements of the database by reviewing existing documentations and interviewing end user the data model has two output output data model the first first is an entity relationship diagram which represents the data structures in a pictorial form because the diagram is easily learned it is valuable tool to communicate the model to the end user the second component is a data document this is a document that describes the details and the data object relationships and rules required by the database the dictionary provides the details required by the database developers to construct the physical database why is data modeling important of data modeling important data modeling is probably the most labor intensive and time consuming part of the development process why bother especially if you are pressed for time a common response by parti practitioners who write on the subject is that you should know more build a database without a model that you should build a house without blueprints the goal of the data model is to make sure that the all data objects required by the database are completely and accurately represented because the data model uses easily understood notations and natural language it can be reviewed and verified as correct by the end user the data model is also detailed enough to be used by the database developers to use as a blueprint blueprint for building the physical database the information contained in the data model will be used to define the relational tables primary and foreign key stored procedure and triggers a poorly designed database will require more than more time in the long term without careful planning you may create a database that omits data required to create CL critical reports produces results that are incorrect or inconsistent and is unable to accommodate changes in the user requirements dat model important important data model is probably the most labor in intensive and time consuming parts of the development process The Entity relationship model of entity relationship model The Entity relationship model was organ originally proposed by Peter in 1976 as a way to unify the network and relational database views Network relational database management system the en relationship model simply stated that ER model is a conceptual data models that views the real world as entities and relationship a basic component of the model is the entity relationship diagram which is used to visually represents data object since chain Road his paper the model has been exist extended and today it is commonly used for database design for the database designer the utility of the ER model is it Maps well to the relational model it Maps it Maps well to relational model the construct used in the ER model can easily be transformed into relational table second is it is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training it is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training training therefore the model can be used by the database designer to communicate the design to the end user in addition the model can be used as a design plan by the database developer to implement a data model in a specific database management software third one a basic construct of the ER modeling basic construct of the ER modeling is the ER models the ER models view the real world world as a construct of entities and associations between entities entities entities are the principal data object about which information is to be collected yeah important entities are the principal data object about which information is to be collected entities are usually recognized Concepts either create or abstract such as person place things or events which have relevance to the database some specific examples of entities are employees projects invoices an entity is analog logous to a table in the relational model entities are classified as independent or dependent in some methologies the terms used are strong and weak respectively an independent entities is one that does not really on another for identification a depend entities is one that release on another for identification a special entity types Association entities are entities used to associate two or more entities in order to reconcile a many to many relationship subtypes entities are used in generalizations herchies to represent a subset of instance of their parent entities called the super type but which have attributes or relationship that apply only to the subset associative entities and generalization heres are discuss

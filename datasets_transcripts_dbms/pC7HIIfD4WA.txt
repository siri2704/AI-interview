welcome back to channel TNC learning the sequential circuit and integrated CC that is already one the next topic is sequential circuits a sequential circuit is a logic circuit that consist of a memory element okay combination combin combinational Circ main key feature output of the sequential circuit depends on the present input as well as the past output of the circuit okay present next the types of sequential Circ asynchronous sequential circuit and synchronous sequential circuits okay combinational CC with memory element sequen CC two types asynchronous sequential circuit and synchronous sequential circuit asynchronous sequential Circ it's a type of sequential Circ that does not depend on the clock CC with the memory element sequential circuit okay synchronous sequential circuit is a type of sequential circuit in which all the memory elements are synchronized by a common clock signal memory elements clonus as synchronus no clock signal synchron synchron sorry syn sequen memory units control units sequential CC synon sequential CC examples next sequential CC applications couns registers memory elements State machines Tim sequential circuit applications there are two types of storage elements used sequential CC two types of storage elements that is element and flipflops okay can store a single bit of information temporary two points okay single bit and temporary storage or not gates gates latch applications dat stage then control circut flipflop Circ sorry they are often used in combination with digital and element Sr latches gated Sr latches D latches JK latches and T latches sratches s for set R for reset set reset next change no change okay next one okay next okay forbidden State both S and R inputs are at one the latch is said to be in an undefined State okay undefined State forbidden State they are also known as pre preset clear States the Sr latch forms the basic building blocks for all other types of flip flops so flip flop basic building block so next St en are also known as transparent latches okay transparent lates that is D that are implemented using two inputs data and clock signal the output of the follows the input at D terminal as long as the clock signal is high the output of the follows the input at the D ter because already okay the next flipflop is JK latch okay JK latch sorry next latch is JK latch so JK J the output gets toggled When J and K inputs are high JK latches just like Sr latch but it eliminates the undefined state of Sr latch 0 0 1 1 1 1 output gets toled When J and K inputs are high that is ch zet one meaning set meaning okay is q okay next is t t when JK inputs of JK are shortened that okay toggle latch latches are used in clocks as storage usage Element or memory element latch can store one bit of data latch is a memory element with one bit storage a memory element with one bit storage is known as next is flipflop two memory elements sequential a basic flipflop can be constructed using four nand or four narat important Point fop okay four foures flipflop is popularly known as basic digital memory circuit memory Circ it it has its two State logic one high logic zero now low State a flip-flop is a sequential circuit which consist of single binary state of information or data a digital circuit is a flip-flop which has two outputs and are of opposite State stable multi important then types of flipflop Sr J D and T flipflop first one Sr flipflop that is the simplest flipflop this is the simplest flipflop circuit it has a set input and reset output when in this circuit when s is set as active the output would be high and the Q will be low undefined State once the outputs are established the result of the circuit are maintained until s get changed or the power is turn off next one the JK flipflop in JK flipflop the basic structure of the flipflop which consist of a clock clear then preset okay application of the JK flip flop flipflop find extensive use in various application counters shift register memory un St that is qal one set Q equal to Z toggle Q changes is B change based on the input no change Q maintains it current value frequency divisions the terms four sorry the four no change okay value Z One value one value one Z next next state next state next value one k value one that is no Change clock f okay next the Master Slave Master Slave JK flipflop in JK flipflop when both inputs and clock is set to one for a long time then Q output toggle until the clock is one the UNC orable output produces this problem is referred to as raise round condition okay JK flipflop flip flop clock set to one only for a very short time Master Slave flipflop is constructed by combining two JK flip flops so Master Slave flip flop J fop these flip flops are connected in series configuration series configuration connect in these two flipflop the first flipflop workers and the second fop slave flipflop is designed in such a way that the output of the master flip flop is passed to both the inputs of the slave flipflop okay the Master Slave flipflop is design of the fpop to both thep of outut of the SL flip flop is passed to the input of the master flipflop sorry in Master Slave flip flop apart from these two flip flop an inverter or not gate is also used in the master an inverter orate is also used foring the inverted clock pul to the SL FP floped [Music] fop the inverter is connected to the clock pulse clock in simple words this when CP set to that clock pulse is set to false for master then CP is set to true for the slave and the clock pul master m okay okay difference between Edge triggered and level triggered flipflop Edge Edge flipflop changes only when there is a specific transition of the clock signal then level trigger flip-flop changes only to The Continuous level of the toward dur transition from to one or one to then Master flip flop differ from a simple fop interconnected flipflop which operates as a master and other as a slave okay simple flip flop then differences between synon and asynchronous flipflop clock signal synchronous flipflop changes to clock signal as synchronous flipflop independent of the clock signal main difference then register registers in digital electronics registers is a collection of flipflop okay fpop FP flop is used to store single bit the storage capacity is increased by grouping more than one flipflop so the flip flop if we want to store anit word we have to useit registering number fop number of flipflop okay the register is used to perform different types of operations operations it is used to take the inst instruction given by the user to fish the instructions stored into the main memory user just get code the decode operation is used to interpret the instruction in decode the operation performed on the instructions is identified by the CPU so uh identifyed by the CPU in simple words the decode operation is used to decode the instruction okay that is memory encode then decode operation is used to interpret the instruction the instruction just is used to store the result produced by the CPU into memory after storing this result it is displayed on the user screen exod ex different types of register PC program counter then IR instruction register temporary registers inpr out register input register processor then memory okay so memory address registers that contains the memory address of data and instruction okay program counter is also called instruction address register instruction next memory address of the instruction which is going to be executed after then accul the CP most the accumulator is used to store the system then memory data register is a part of computer control unit okay memory data register computer it contains the data that we want to store in computer storage or data fed from the computer storage the data which is to be read out or written into the address location is contained in the m next index register the hard element okay index register Hardware element that holds the number number the number adds to the computer instructions address to create an effective next memory buffer that it contains the meta data of the data and instruction written in or read from memory okay the instruction temporarily store the DAT the next is shift register a group of flipflop which is used to store multiple bits of data and the data is moved from one flipflop to another is known as shift registers one from one flipflop is mve to another flipflop flip flop that is moved from one flipflop to another is known as shift register shift that allows the datas to be shifted from one flipflop to another is called shift register always is applied clock to formit shift register we have to connect number fop shift register can shift the bits either to the left or to the right right sorry shift shift bits either to the left or to the right the shift register which shift the bit bit to the left is called shift left register okay and it shift bit right is known as the shift shift right register okay shift shift right right register okay the shift register is classified into following types serial in serial out serial in parall out parallel in serial out parall in parall out what are shift register Universal shift register okay these are the types of shift register first serial input serial output the data is shifted in or out serially okay serial input serial output short form shifted at a time either right or left direction under Ser the data is passed Ser to the then shift register the binary number after shifting each bit of the number to the left by one position it will be equalent to the number produced by multiplying the original number by two numberin number one okay by one universal sh register where the data is shifted in one direction is known as unidirectional shift register a register in which data is shifted in both direction is known as B directional shift register Universal shift register this a special type of register that can load the data in parallel way and shift the data in both direction that is right or left okay Universal shift the next topic is counters counters or digital circuits designed to count clock pulses or other input events the register that is used to count the clock pulses or other input events they typically consist of flipflop along with logic flip flop couns are available Ines as synchronus these counters change their state at times usually in response to external clock signals external clock signals response sorry external signal respon respon change their state at times they find usage in applications frequency Division and even counting applications then the asynchronous counter is also known as the Ripple counter asron counter in which two fop okay by setting both of the inputs to one permanent clock pass to the pass to the clock input to the first flip flop first flip flop flip flop and its output that is is pass to to the clock input of the next flipflop that is ffb counters synchronous counter in the as synchronous counter the present counters output passes to the input of the next coun so the counters are connected like chain delay and the propagation delay also occurs during the counting stage the propagation delay the synchronous counter is designed to remove this drawback drawback over counter the same clock pulses passed to the clock input of all the flip flop FP flop bit synchronous counter in which the input of the first flip flop to one so the flip flop will work as a toggle flip flop that is T flip flop the output of the first flip flop is passed to both the input the next J flipflop so the first flipflop will work as a toggle flipflop the output of the first flipflop is passed to the both the inputs of the next JK flipflop logical diagram applications frequency division counters play a role in dividing the frequency of a clock signal allowing the generation of the frequency signals okay or clock sign then even they are also used to tally events like button presses sensor reading or network packets even counting then timer or counter units in microcontrollers counters are utilized as timers to Trigger action after a predefined counter next is counter is a type of asynchronous counter used in digital electronics it is called a ripple counter because the clock pul ripples through the flipflop delay in the outut the output so this counter is formed by cascading flip flop where the output of one flop one flip flop drives the clock input of the nextop flops are used with different clock pulses then all asynchronous counter toggle mode all flip flops operate in toggle mode then clock only one flip flop is applied with an external clock pulse and the clock for the next flip flop is obtained from the output of the previous flip flop then counting sequence the flipflop with the external clock pulse act as the LSB in the counting sequence okay signic signic then types of Ripple counter up counter down counter up down counter counts in ascending order ascending ending up down can count both ascending and descending order the next is ring counter in digital electronics a ring counter is a type of digital counter circuts constructed using shift register it operates by circulating the databits through a sequence of flipflop forming a closed loop Clos Loop this Cy shifting Behavior gives rise to unique properties and applications working principle ring counter typically consist of set of flipflop connected in circular man each flipflop out output is connected to the input of the next flipflop okay and output of the last flip is fed back again to the input of the first F when a clock signal is applied the data bits are shifted from one flipflop to next with each clock cycle nexts there are two main types of ring counters straight ring counter Twisted ring counter straight ring counter name one H counter Twisted rink Johnson counter in this type the output of the last flip flop is connected to the input of the first flipflop it circulates a single one or a single zero bit around the ring twist this type connects to complement of the output of the last flipflop to the input of the first flip flop last flip flop it cir streams of one follows by Z around the ring one followed by Z then sequencing applications sequencing pattern generation decoding and control frequency division ring counters applications the next topic is integrated circuts before the discovery of Isis that is in the inte resist IND soe to after the invention of the semiconductors and transistors semiconductors trans things were quite simplified C then types of integrated CC digital integrated circuit analog integrated circuit and mixed CES okay divide based on application based on Technology based on integration level okay by one digital integrated CC okay digital design approach is used to create different integrated circuits which are used in the computer memory such as RAM R it enhances both Circ density and overall efficiency which are created using this approach will operate in binary next is analog integrated circuit analog integrated circuit analog integrator design is referred to as the process of creating input data can used in many functions such as amplification filtering regulation and oscillation digital I will Pro process two inputs but analog is will have different range of voltage levels digal and have both analog and digital designs in a single chip the integration will allow the mixer I to process analog as well as linear integrated circuits linear integrated circuits have indefinite number of continuous inputs output States linear integrated CC again divided into general purpose and special purpose example then digital CC have finite number of discrete inputs infinite number of continuous input and output State fin number of discrete inputs and output States okay there are two types of integrated circuits based on techology based application based application based on Technology based integrated C and hology two types integrated CC based on technology bip sorry one and one and okay so integrated C based onology two Ty monolithic and hybrid Moni bip the types of integrated Circ it acts as a full circuit design on a single piece of silicon single piece of silicon secondes many chip twoip then bipolar in the bipolar saturated logic family the bipolar transistors are used as main device TTL is an example for saturated bipolar logic TTL transistor transistor logic okay transistor to transistor logic is an example of bipolar logic TTL Junction and dialectric dialectric isolation positive PN positive negative Junction isolation thenc unar met oide semiconductor family the metallic oxide semiconductor field affect the transistor okay in the MOs category there are three logic families pmos nmos CMOS then pmos is the oldest and the slowest Type n MOS is used for large scale integration and arrangement of Channel and P Channel okay then mosfet is extensively used where lower power conception is needed such such again un divid into the Moni and hdne number of individual chip integrat circuit has a full circuit constructed on a single piece of silicon or other semiconductor often ceramic sub carrying one or more silicon chips hybrid can also use to mix a technology that is one Gallum and AR G gum a for aric Semiconductor chips then small in size as compared to hybrides then all the components are formed together by various method which include diffusion oron implant comp in case of hybrid integrated circuits interconnection usually established by TM mode transmission lines okay monolithic I are expensive hybrid I are less expensive speed is high as compared to hybrid speed is lower monolithic Isis provide smaller flexibility circuit design greater flexibility circuit design okay the difference then based on integration levels third type Okay small scale integration medium scale integration large scale very large scale then dimension of thegr based on integration level Di medale large digital logic families in integrated CES TTL that is transistor transistor Logic the transistor transistor Logic the logic is are built around transistor which is why it is called TTL okay basic gate in the TL Circ is gate okay there are many types of TTL families standard TTL speed TTL low power TTL Scot key TTL then low power scoty TTL then Advanced scoty TTL Advanced low scotl fast scotl then e e stands for emiter coupled logic in this logic digital logic family and of the transistors are coupled and also those transistor are operated in more active regions than saturation regions so the meters of the transistors are coupled and also those transistors are operated in more active regions than saturated the basic gate in E circuit is r and N okay R and nand okay R and Nar then MOS MOS stands for metal oxide semiconductor the digital logic family designed simpler with low power the basic gate in the mo logic n gate n Tye P type areas then C complimentary metal oxide Semiconductor in seos the basic logic gets Nar and n the gates okay seos is designed with a combination ofos andos there are some types of seos they are static seos Ando Enos okay cation in memory devices integrated CES is used in microwaves then temper couns applications of integr cutes so overall first unit first part that is digital electronics or digital circuit the again computer questions and questions okay okay so thanks for watching this video please subscribe our channel to get

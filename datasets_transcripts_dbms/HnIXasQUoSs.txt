welcome to my Chanel relation model okay so topic right okay okay so relation model represent the database as a collection of relations a relation is nothing but a value of table tables of values okay okay so every row in a table represent a collection of related data values these rows in a table denoted a real world Rel relations relable 350 for exampes okay so Rel okay so Rel Rel model that relations are saved in form in the table format so table format okay a table has two properties rows and column so table two proper columns okay so row column okay row represent records column represent attributes so rows next attributes colum each column in a table each column in a table attribute each column attributes are properties which Define the relationship so Rel name attributes properties of properties of relation properties of table okay Seri number s name marks relation student table columns okay 350 102 na 450 103 RI 380 Colum rows okay next attribute domain attributes domain fored value okay so attributes predefined value for example Ser number number okay number number attribute has some predefined values and scope which known as attribute domain so predefined value system okay right next relational schema relational scha structure table for example Rel and name of the columns or attributes for example seral number s name definition schema Okay so right next relational keys in the relational key every row has one or more attribute it can be identified theow in the relation example number number okay right okay okay so relation structure of the table only student Rel algebras so it is a procedural language it it's a procedural language it consist of a set of operators that can be performed on relation so relation okay so Union intersection minus Time Square selection projection division rename join relation it display total values okay so total values for examp disal values in both Rel it avoid duplicate values in both relationship okay so U symbol is can be used so duplicate values RI Raju duplicate values only single so it will avoid duplicate values Aon elements in both relationship R so intersection b r right so next difference difference El Rel intersection b b intersection a b a a b right next caran product okay caran product it is it has a new relation consist of all pairs all pairs okay so all pairs pair wise combination of all in A and B okay so the relation a has M elements and relation B has n elements then the result will be M into next next so RI ad RI rii Raju Raju Raji Sur ADI 3 into 3 total ENT right next selection process selection displays all attributes or Columns of all rows in a relationship okay SOB okay so operator can be used sigma operator can be used to select the attributes in a relation okay so [Music] static oper is marks greater than all attributes or Columns of all the rows in a relationship okay so operator use only thees Rel operation okay so next projection projection specific for example only student number [Music] student operator can be used select some specific columns in a relation it selects stle that satisfy the given prediction from the from a relation it displays some specified colum by some next divide the from one relation to another relation for example B right next it gives another name to the relation name okay so Rel Rel nextal four sorry okay soal joint Jo joint right joint Jo so natural Jo Jo left joint right joint full joint so okay so natural joint is a set of of all combinations in R and S okay so R and S that are equal to the their common attribute name okay so it is of tles of all combinations in R and S for example R and table s and for example employ okay employe natural of all combinations okay so combinations okay EMP joints and extension join operation it is used to deal with missing information so missing information for example first left outer joint uh left outer joint contains all set of tles of all combinations in R ands they are equal on the basis on common attribute name okay so employe s salary okay don't get confused okay so in the left outer joint tles in R has no match tles in the S right so ram ram sham sham uh har har RI Ri so RI salary sh right okay okay so right join uh full outer join left or right except that it contains all rows from the both tables okay so full outer joint is like a left or right joint R rity join combination okay in full outer joint tles in R has no match tles in s and tles in s that have no matching R in their common attribute name okay so employable employ table Val right okay so left okay right so next same okay so it is also known as inner joint okay so it is the most common joint it is based on math data as per the equality conditions okay so equ join uses the comp oper ex so call ID class ID name product ID City and support thank you

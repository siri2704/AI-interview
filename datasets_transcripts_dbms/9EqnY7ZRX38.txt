hello everyone myself business and my role number 536 and my topic is explain different types of keys available in relational model what are case in dbms keys in dbms is an attribute or set of attributes which helps you to identify row or row tuple in a relational table they allow you to find the relation between two tables keys helps you uniquely uniquely identify a row in a table by combination of one or more columns in the table keys key is also helpful for finding unique record or row from the table database key is also useful also helpful for finding unique record or row from the table example employee id first name and last name from this we can we can see that in a given example employee id is a primary key because it uniquely identifies an employee record in this table no other employee can have the same employee id why we need a key here are some reasons for using sql key in dbms system keys helps you to identify any row of data in a table in a real-world application a table could contain tons of records moreover the records could be duplicated keys in rdbms ensure that you can uniquely identify a table record despite these challenges allows allows you to establish a relationship between and identify relation between tables help you to enforce identity and integrity in the relationship types of keys in dbms there are mainly eight different types of keys in dbms and each key has different functionality [Music] first one is super keyance and primary key candidate key alternate key foreign let's look at each of the keys in dbms with example super key a super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table primary key either a primary key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in the table candidate key candidate k is a set of attributes that uniquely identifiables in a table candidate k is a super key with no repeater attributes alternate key alternate key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in the table foreign key is that column that creates a relationship between two tables the purpose of one key is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity component key compound key has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record it is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the database composite key component key is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table the combination of columns guarantees uniqueness though individual in uniqueness is not guaranteed key surrogate key is an artificial artificial key which aims to uniquely unify each record is called sarovichy this kind of clear unit because they are created when you don't have a natural primary key what is super key a super key is a group of single or multiple keys which identifies rows in a table a super key may have additional attributes that are not needed for unique identification example emp ssn um emp number emp in the given example emp session and emp num are super keys what is the primary key primary key in dbms is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identify every row in the table the primary key can't be duplicate meaning the same value can't appear more than once in a table a table cannot have more than one primary key rules for defining primary key two rows can can't have the same primary key value it must it it must for every row to have primary key value the primary key field cannot be null the price the value in a primary key column can never be modified or updated if any foreign key refers to that primary key example student id row and roll number first name last name and email in the in this example we can see that student id is a primary key the student is a primary key and and and it is not been and it is normal what is alternate key alternate keys is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies every row in the table a table can have multiple choices for a primary key but not only one can be set as a primary key all the keys which are not primary key are called as alternate example in this table we can see that there are four five columns student and a role number first name last name and email and in this in this table since student id is a primary key role number email address becomes the alternative key you may invistable student id role number email or qualify to become primary key but since student id primary key role number email becomes the alternative key can what is candidate key can it key in sql sector attributes that uniquely add inflatables in a table candid k is a super k with no repeater attributes the primary key should be selected from the candidate keys every table must have at least a single candidate key a table can have multiple candidate keys but not only a single primary key properties of candidate key it must contain unique values candidate key in sql may have multiple attributes must and it must not contain null values and it should should not contain minimum fields to answer uniqueness and uniquely unify each record in a table and candidate key example in the in the given table student id role number an email or candidate keys which helps us to uniquely identify the student recording table as you can see that student id role number and email roll number in email or candidate which helps us to uniquely identify student record in the table can in in the example we can see that student air roll number and email is standard key student is primary key and roll number and email are the alternative keys what is foreign key foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables the purpose of foreign case is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity it accesses cross cross reference between two tables as it references the primary key of under table example department code and department name teacher id faculty name and and last name first name and last name in the in this key in dbms example we have total teacher teacher and department in school however there is no way to see which which search working in which department in this table adding the foreign key in department code to the teacher name we can create a relationship between two tables as you can see by uh by by adding department code be between these two we can we can create a foreign key between these two tables the the concept is also on referential integrity we can see that teeth already and department code we we have established a relationship between these two tables what is compound key compound key has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record it is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within database however when combined with other column or columns the combination of compound keys become unique the purpose of the compound key in database is to uniquely identify each record in the table example in the in a in this table order number and product id can't be primary as it does not uniquely identify record however a compound key of order id and product id could be used as it uniquely identifies each record mode is compound key com port key is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table the combination of columns is not guaranteed hence they are combined to uniquely identify records in a table the difference between compound and con and the compound key is that any part of compound key can be a foreign key but the compound key may or may not be a part of of the car of the foreign game what is an artificial key which aims to uniquely end for each record is called surrogacy this kind of slk in dbms is unique because it is created when you don't have any natural primary key they do not lend any meaning to the data in the table surrogate key in dbms is usually an integer a surrogate key the value generator right before the record is inserted into a table and as uh as we can see in the given table shift time and sub have different employee in in this example a surrogate key is needed to uniquely enforce each employee so as you can see that in start time and end time is different for being different for the members of the working working members circuit keys in sql are allowed when nope no property has the parameter of the primary key in the table when the primary is too big or complicated and that's it thank you everyone

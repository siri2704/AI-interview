hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channel I 
am RTI and I'm back with another lecture of the   dbms series so in this particular video we would 
be knowing about some extended ER features so   these extended ER features comes into picture 
now because what happens ke sometimes when we   are drawing the ER model or when we are drawing 
the entities there might be a possibility that   the structure becomes so complex there is no code 
reusability there is some data inconsistency which   is also Ed so to get rid of all these to lesser 
the complexity to increase the data consistency   and much more things we come with the extended 
ER features so let's see about this so again   the question is why do we need we design ER model 
for relationship between entities now in the real   world the data May exhibit some hierarchical 
relationships and the E eer that is extended   entity relationship model provides the mechanism 
to represent this Rel relationships accurately   which helps in code reusability ensuring 
data integrity and consistency and lowering   the complexity so uh in the real world consider 
that there is a person now person may have some   attribute such as name age now this person may be 
acting a different roles at different platforms or   different areas so this person may be a student 
so student may have details such as student ID   student uh Adar card or something like that or 
student subject now this person may also be when   he or she is like uh doing some online shopping 
or doing some uh taking some orders or giving   some orders may also be acting as a customer 
for any of the website so when the person is   customer it may have customer ID C customer order 
detail and much more thing so what is happening   now there is one entity person which is now being 
overburdened with all the attributes such as name   age now there is student Adar student subject 
student ID customer ID customer order ID so what   happens in this case now if we just split it into 
different subgroups such as customer and student   and now now the attribute which is common among 
both that is name so name stays with the person   just a second name stays with the person some 
attributes such as age which is also common   for person customer and student so it Remains the 
Same but when we are coming to customer there are   some distinctive attributes which only customer 
have student doesn't have so such as customer ID   so customer ID stays with the customer and for 
student student subject so in this way what is   happening now we are subgrouping the entities 
into different entities so uh these kind of   things like hierarchical relationship which 
is being established so you might have seen   in inheritance that there is a super class 
and there is some subass so in inheritance   what happens is can super the subass or the child 
class inh all the properties present in the super   class in the same way the person is having name 
and age which is now inherited with customer and   student but now student and customer also have 
their distinctive attributes such as student ID   and customer ID so basically in this extended ER 
features we would be seeing three features first   one is specialization second one is aggregation 
and third one is generalization let me just give   you a overview about all these three then we would 
be separately looking about all these three in   details in next set of videos so in specialization 
what happens as I told that person maybe person   may have some overburden attributes because 
person may be acting as a customer person may   be acting as a employee person may be acting as a 
student so person entity all alone may be having   many attributes so what we do is can we subgroup 
person enti uh entity into different entity such   as person may be subgrouped into customer uh 
employee student so that the attributes are not   overburdened to the person and also customer 
employee student may have their distinctive   attributes so that is called a specialization in 
this we do a top- down approach and it follows the   concept of inheritance now coming to the second 
one that is aggregation now aggregation from   the word it means aggregating something so what 
happens in aggregation is now sometimes there are   some relationship which is tary relationship so 
more more than three entities are involved or n   relationships in which more than three to four or 
five many entities are in involved so when there   are involvement of more than two entities or there 
are involvement of more than degree two then what   happens now the uh structure becomes very complex 
so when the structure becomes very complex what we   do is can we aggregate the higher level entities 
and then we establish a relationship between two   entities so in aggregation what we do is can we 
do abstraction of the higher level entity into   one entity and then we establish the relationship 
again if you're not understanding no worries we   would be looking in depth about all these in the 
next set of videos now in the generalization what   happens so in generalization consider that 
there are two entities first is the saving   account second one is the current account 
now the saving account and current account   may have some attributes which is common among 
saving account and current account so why not   to make a generalized attribute that is account 
which would be having account number and account   name which is present in the saving accounts as 
well and current account as well so basically   in specialization uh we are just identifying 
the subgroup entities in generalization using   that subgroup entities we are uh guessing the 
generalized attribute uh generalized entity so   this is all about specialization aggregation and 
generalization we would be looking in depth uh   about all these in next set of videos so this was 
all about this video I hope you like this video   If you like this video please hit the like button

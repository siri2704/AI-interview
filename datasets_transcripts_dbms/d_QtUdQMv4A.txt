hi everyone uh welcome to the ml Hub in this video we will discuss the books resources and the subject weightage for uh gate D exam so uh coming to the gate uh subjects uh which are there in gate D syllabus so we have these eight subjects overall uh probability statistics calculus and optimization and linear algebra these three are mathematics and in Gate da there is no strict boundary for maths like in Gate CS we have 13 marks fixed for mathematics but in Gate da uh just the maths section can go up till 40 50 marks okay so I will discuss the subject weightage as well for 2025 and 2024 at the end of the video so like just watch the video completely and then we have programming data structures algorithms and dbms and warehousing so these two are uh same from gate CS syllabus as well so those who are writing Cs and da both uh generally these two subjects you'll know from your CS preparation as well then we have machine learning and artificial intelligence these are purely gate da subjects and then aptitude so the weightage of aptitude aptitude is fixed for all gate da branches uh 15 marks questions come from here so uh coming to textbooks uh and the syllabus this is the syllabus for probability and statistics this is the entire syllabus as given by the I authorities uh these are all the topics and in our course we have like divided them into different modules like uh specifically for probability and statistics there will be six modules and all these Concepts will be covered and generally we tend to cover like additional Concepts as well which we think might be possible like which might come in Gate exam so this is the syllabus for uh probability and stats uh and the textbook which uh you can like go through is Introduction to probability and stats for engineers and scientists this is uh this is by Sheldon M Ross it is a standard textbooks uh a standard textbook and uh even in iits when you take like higher level uh courses like 600 plus level courses and if you take a probability course the same textbook will be referred uh and also like to prepare this course I use the same textbook okay so like while creating probability and stats I I have actually gone through the entire Sheldon Ross book uh just so that you don't have to go through uh but still like if you find difficulties in some portions you want to refer a textbook you want to solve more questions uh you can go through this okay uh uh so this is the textbook and uh coming to linear algebra and also like this textbook covers the advanced topics like uh statistical inference as well so for probability stats you don't need to go to any other textbook this one is sufficient next one is linear algebra again all the all the topics in linear algebra are covered in just one book Gilbert Strang uh like starting with Vector spaces subspaces and then system of linear equations how to solve them then basic properties of matrices determinants rank nity everything okay you'll find everything in Gilbert Shan textbook uh we will be referring the same textbook for for the lecture classes as well again like watch the lecture uh lecture videos first and only for the topics which you find difficult and you're not able to understand or if you want to do more practice uh refer the textbooks uh next is calculus and optimization uh the syllabus for calculus is like this it's mostly same as gate CS so for probability and linear algebra there are additional topics like uh like the syllabus is very large in Gate da but for calculus it's almost the same just one op optimization involving a single variable is an extra topic uh but that to is covered in the Gilbert Strang book so there is a Gilbert Strang book for calculus and linear algebra both and they both are standard textbooks like uh but see for maths specifically uh if you see the textbook directly without watching videos it will be very difficult for you to understand them uh you can try it once for Sheldon Ross or Gilbert Strang uh trust me uh if you just directly go with textbooks uh it will be slightly difficult and we make the lecture Series in a way so that you can understand these books easily so you can go through the books after you watched the videos that will again like improve your understanding of the subject uh so this was calculus uh again this book covers optimization Concepts as well and actually limit continuity differentiability but the uh important thing to not note is these books are like J level okay the foreign author books so you need to draw a boundary like a gate syllabus doesn't cover the entire textbook like if you uh start going through the textbook that will take a lot of time and that is why like just see the topics which are covered in the class and only for those refer the textbook next is programming and DSA uh note uh carefully that in Gate da the programming is in Python uh there is no question asked for C or C++ in the last years and only programming in Python is there then you have basic data structures Stacks cues uh link list trees and hash tables then uh there are search gorithms linear search and binary search uh then we have basic sorting algorithms uh selection bubble and uh insertion then merge sort and quick sort so the syllabus is more or less uh same as gate CS uh gate CS has more uh topics in DSA actually like you have dynamic programming as well there so here like in the last two years no questions from uh DP have been asked um they are they are stuck with the syllabus which has been given so you don't need to cover uh DP uh if you have to do DSA and graph theory is important so basic graph algorithms traversal and shortest path this like there is a like few concepts are common in DSA and AI both so you will see this uh graph traversal specifically and tree traversal in AI as well so it is very important because it is covered in two subjects at least two to three questions have been in all years so we will cover this deeply and also we will give you videos for DP as well although they are not required for gate da you can go through them uh like if you want okay coming to textbook for python you can uh refer the book by Ryan Turner uh uh this book covers uh basic Python Programming you don't need advanced level python for uh gate exam and this book covers like detailed code Snippets as well uh generally in gate for python they will give you a code snippet and uh you have to predict the output okay so we will do lot such like lot of practice for such problems in the classes as well for algorithms the like the god textbook Corman again like uh if you start reading Corman straight away you'll not understand anything the algorithm written in Corman will be like much more difficult okay and the pseudo code also what we cover in class as compared to what is covered in class uh but again like if you want to have a deeper knowledge and if you want to solve more questions uh you can go to uh Corman next is dbm dbms and warehousing uh here there are two different modules which you can see in the syllabus this is the entire dbms part which is exactly same as gate CS syllabus and this is the entire warehousing part and almost uh there is equal weightage of both uh from what we have seen in past Trends as well okay uh so equal number of questions come from warehousing as well generally Gat CA students think like they will only cover the dbms part but you cannot leave warehousing okay and we have covered warehousing in detail in our course uh each and every topic it is very difficult to find a single textbook for all warehousing Concepts there are a few data mining books uh and we have gathered the entire uh course from different uh web pages and these data mining books okay but the dbms you can cover from C sashan if you want for warehousing we are not giving any single textbook here because uh it will not cover for everything for gate da next is machine learning very important again there is no single textbook specifically for machine learning which will cover all these topics uh but what I've tried to do is uh I've given you two textbooks here one is handson ml it covers almost all the topics in the syllabus uh but it's more for uh practice so you need to learn the theory from the lectures first uh I have gathered the theory from again different different resources different textbooks as single textbook doesn't cover it uh but if you want to do the code and learn the theory as well you can go to this textbook and in our lecture series uh we cover the uh Concepts along with piece of code so you can think of it this way so for every topic uh mentioned here we give you practice code in python as well so there so that your python gets revised and also you have small small projects uh for every topic in ml okay and ml cabus is big and it is one of the most important uh subject in Gate da so this is the textbook for ML and for deep learning specifically uh for these two topics this is under deep learning and uh almost every year they ask around four to five marks of questions from Deep learning or neural networks and this is the textbook uh this is the textbook we used to read in our mtech for like uh foundations of ml course um and this is a brilliant textbook but again uh only a very small like four to five marks of questions come from neural networks uh so don't go and read the entire textbook but this is what you can refer for deep learning next we have ai ai again has three parts uh search Logic and reasoning under uncertainty so search and reasoning are covered in this book uh Peter norg again like if you go to like like ISC iits all AI courses like uh this is a textbook they will follow we have read it in our mtech and uh it covers the entire a syllabus it covers logic part as well but the logic part in this textbook is not that easy to understand uh if you want a textbook just for logic you can go with Kenneth Rosen so this is a discret maths book for gate CS students uh you can go the like you can go and check the logic part uh from this textbook so yeah these are uh all the textbooks for different subjects uh for aptitude again like you don't need any textbook per se you can just solve Indian like you can just take any Indian author textbook like RS Agarwal it has lot of practice problems uh whenever you get time just solve them uh that is enough uh don't uh get get like it's not like uh don't get too much like heavy textbooks for aptitude like just RS will be sufficient uh just solve a lot of questions from that book okay now important part like coming to the subject weightage again this changes is every year you can see a drastic change from 2024 to 20 2025 uh in 2025 the paper was uh more math heavy okay so they made the paper more lengthy and more math heavy uh so the weightage of probability linear algebra and calculus was increased as you can see so around 40 45% of paper just came from maths and uh see you cannot make Trends even if you analyze last 10 years data apply regression you will not be able to predict what will happen next year this is just for reference key how much weightage uh the subjects have generally speaking all subjects have equal weightage in Gate exam and uh this is just to show you that you cannot ignore any subject okay so this is the weightage of uh every uh subject in gate2 and we have given you the number of one Mark and two Mark questions asked in every subject as well so this is for 2025 and this is for 2024 cool uh so this was about the textbooks the resources which you can follow and the subject weightage for uh every uh subject which has been asked in Gate da again we got this suggestion from you guys in the comment section you should create a video on that so if you want more videos like these uh more General videos let us know in the comment section what we should create next so that we can help you we will create such videos and upload on the channel uh so like do subscribe to the channel if you need more content related to ml or G da and if you want to subscribe to our course uh it will be uh available on the ml hub. so yeah uh train learn conquer that's our Moto uh subscribe to the channel like the video uh let's meet in the next session bye [Music]

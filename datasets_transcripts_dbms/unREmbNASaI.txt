[Music] hi everyone this is prachita from edureka and today we will be learning about what are primary keys and foreign key in sql but before we get started if you are new to our channel please subscribe to this channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update also if you are interested in online certification courses please check out the link given in the description below in today's video we will be discussing what are primary keys examples of primary key syntax of primary key and then we will talk about what are foreign keys examples of foreign key and syntax of audit key so to begin with what is primary key primary key is basically a restriction so the primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely defines each row in a table so when we set a column as primary key it will always have a unique data that is it will have no duplicates in it or there will not be any null value or the value should never change so let's check out an example of primary key so this is a customer table with customer id first name last name and city as we can see there are different customer ids with different customer names and city here in this table the first name and the last name or the city can be repetitive like rohit sinha and sakshi sinha they both have the same last name so which column has the unique values that would be the customer id column so we can set the customer id as our primary key so here in columns first name last name and city we can have duplicates like both rohit and sakshi has surname sinha even cities can have duplicases like both ajay rathor and rohit sinha live in the city of mumbai but the id column will be unique for them all to every customer there will be one customer id which will not be repetitive or duplicate so now let's see how to write a syntax on primary key so to set a primary key in a table we use the following syntax we use the create table syntax with the table name that we want then we define the column names with their data types and we can have as many columns as we require and lastly we mentioned the primary key that is the column which will be called as the primary key so now if you already have a table and you want to set a column as primary key you can use the alter command so for this we write the command as alter table and the table name where you want to add the primary key and the syntax add primary key with the column name similarly if you want to drop a primary key then again we use the alter table command and here instead of writing add primary key we write drop primary key so next let's talk about what is foreign key so when we set a column as a foreign key the intention is to link the two tables together another point of foreign key is that foreign key of one table is used as primary key in another table it basically helps to create links between tables so let's look into another example to understand it better so here we have two tables one is the customer table another is the city table in the customer table we have the customer details and in the city table we have the name of the cities with their respective ids so let's consider the city id as primary key in city table and customer id in customer table as the primary key now in our customer table we will replace city names with the city ids so in our customer table we'll have the city ids instead of the city names so this way the city id will be the primary key in the city table and the customer id will be the primary key in the customer table and the city column in the customer table will be our foreign key and to link these two tables we can use the city id as the foreign key having city ids in customer table can make the customer table easier and can lower the loading time of the table so now let's look into the syntax of foreign it's almost similar to the primary key syntax itself but it also has the references but as you can see it also has a command called references so what is the purpose of references basically reference is referred to the primary key of another table it gives reference of one table to another table similar to primary key we also have alter commands in foreign key like you can see alter table with the table name and you can add a foreign key with the column and referring to the primary key of another table that is references table and the column name and for dropping a foreign key we can use the similar command just changing it with the drop foreign key instead of add foreign key and we don't have to mention the references so now let's get into the hands-on to have a better idea of primary key and foreign key in mysql so let's get started with our query on mysql workbench so to start with we create a table called citytable so the syntax would look like create table city cid which is the city id end not null auto increment which means that the value of the id will keep on increasing by one then we'll have the city name for which the data type would be var card and not null and primary key now let's run our function so as you can see we have already created a database previously called sales so we'll be using that same database use sales to create a new table called city so in this new city table we'll have the cid that is the city id and then we will find the data type of cid and we've mentioned not null and auto increment means that the city id is going to increase in number by one and then we have the city name which is valkyr we and we have limited it to 50 and not null like it should not take up values with the city name is null and then we have mentioned the primary key as cid which is the city id then we have used the next query that is insert into that is we have inserted the values of the city names into the city table that is as you can see the values mumbai delhi kolkata bangalore chennai hyderabad and we have run the queries so we can see that the tables are created so our next query would be let's type it out so next we will have the table called customers create table in this table the primary key would be the id of the customers so that we have defined as only id and we will write the foreign key as city and referring to the city table where the primary key is c id which is the city id so let's run our query this has created a table called customer where the primary key is id and the foreign key is city so now let's insert values into this table so let's run this query and so now we have the table called customers with the same so if you want to see the customers table you can see that there's id first name last name and city so if you want to see the city table in the city table you can see the city ids have their respective city names so if you want the customers table to show the city names instead of city then we have to join these two tables using the join function that we will learn about in our next video so i hope you like this video and if there's any concept that is not clear you can definitely mention in the comment section below and we will definitely reach out to you so see you again in our next video until then happy learning i hope you have enjoyed

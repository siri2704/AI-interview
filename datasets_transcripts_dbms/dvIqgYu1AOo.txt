in this video let us learn to draw the ER diagram for the topic restaurant management system so what is the first step for drawing the ER diagram first step is we need to identify the entities so what is an entity entities and object with physical or conceptual existence so now let us identify the entities an entity must be written inside a rectangular box so first let us find out the entities and write inside the rectangular boxes so I am drawing a rectangular box inside this I'm writing the entity name restaurant next I'm drawing another entity rectangular box and Writing customer inside it next I'm drawing another rectangular box and writing waiter inside the rectangular box next I am drawing a rectangular box and writing tables inside it I'm drawing another rectangular box and writing cleaning theme inside it next I'm drawing another rectangular box and writing food inside it next I'm drawing another rectangular box and writing Bill counter inside it so restaurant restaurant is an entity because restaurant is a building you're able to touch it physically therefore restaurant is an object which is physically existing therefore this is an entity next customer customer is a person you can physically touch the customer therefore it is an entity waiter is also a person you can physically touch the waiter therefore waiter is an entity table table is an object it is physically present you are able to see the table and you're able to touch the table therefore table is an entity next cleaning Team Cleaning team consists of group of people so every person is physically existing therefore it is an entity food food food you are able to touch therefore it is an entity Bill counter Bill counter is an entity because it is a building where a person will be taken care of the payment so therefore the entities are restaurants customer waiter tables cleaning team foot and Bill counter this is the first step now let us look into the second step in second step we have to write the attributes corresponding to every single entity separately so if you take restaurant what could be the attribute so what is the attribute it is nothing but characteristic of The Entity so what are the characteristics of entity restaurant name of the restaurant next is GST number of the restaurant this am underlining because it is a primary key because GST number is unique for every single restaurant so this is the tax that we pay so this is unique for every single restaurant next it is the location of the restaurant so primary key will always underline okay next it is the phone number of the restaurant I'm putting double ovals because it is multi-value attribute restaurants can provide more than one phone number too so now if two numbers are there one is a landline number and one is the personal number of the restaurant manager Maybe so those two numbers will be multi-value because more than one value is there therefore it is multi-value that is the reason why we are putting double ovals surrounded by this phone number attribute so these are the attributes of restaurants next let us look into the attributes of customer name of the customer this can be further divided as first name middle name and last name so this is known as composite attribute if you're able to divide the attribute further further into many different attributes then I can call that attribute as composite attribute since I'm able to divide the name attribute further I'm calling this name attribute as composite attribute next address of the customer next phone number of the customer double ovals because it is a multi-value attribute customer can also have more than one phone number next feedback customer will provide the feedback after tasting the food after testing the food when they leave the restaurant they'll give their feedback so these are the attributes of the entity customer next what are the attributes of the entity waiter waiter will have a name which is further divided as first name middle name and last name therefore this name attribute is known as composite attribute because you're able to divide it further next salary of the waiter what is the salary provided to the waiter for doing his or her job next count of Waiters so in a residence how many waiters are appointed so that count is an attribute next address of the waiter is an attribute next again phone number of the attribute double oval because it is multi-value attribute Veda can also have more than one phone number next tables count of tables so the attribute is count of tables how many tables are kept in the restaurant next is cleaning team the attributes can be number of members in a team so in cleaning team how many members are there in the restaurant next team members details their personal details it is important after checking their personal details only they can appoint the member in the cleaning theme or in the restaurant for any job next is the shift of the members in the cleaning team is it morning shift or is it evening shift so morning and evening shift so these are the two shifts in the cleaning team next comes the food so when food comes in place total count of food that the restaurants provides what is the total count it provides next it is the name of each food provided in the restaurant next whether the food provider is veg or non-wedge so these are the things coming under the food entity you can also add to sign because Italian or Indian or Chinese which Cuisine you want that comes under the food as an attribute so these are all the attributes of the entity food next you can also add in another attribute sorry another entity which is Chef I'm adding over here another entity which is Chef because in the restaurant Chef is very important right so name of the chef then specialty of d Chef so in which food in which preparation of food this particular Chef is specialized in is it Indian food or some other food so that is the specialty of the chef it may be even a specific dish or it can also be the entire cuisine so that will be the specialty of the chef what is the next attribute total number of chefs present in the restaurant so these are all the attributes of the entity Chef next attributes of the bill counter entity whether you're going to pay through cash or gpay or phone pay or through card so these are all the attributes of the entity Bill counter so this is the second step after completing this step you have to do the last step which is the relationship you have to draw okay the third step is relationship so you need to draw lines and draw the diamond box and connect two entities that is known as relationship so now the first thing is customer draw like this a diamond box so customer goes to restaurant this will be the first one okay customer goes to the restaurant second one waiter serves the food to the customer so this is your second relationship next relationship is customer orders write it inside a diamond box orders the food so this is your third relationship customer orders the food next relationship is Chef Cooks the food so draw a diamond box right cooks and connect it with foot Chef cook the food next it is restaurant has tables next cleaning team cleans the table next cleaning team cleans the restaurant next customer base in the bill counter so these are all the relationships so it is like this customer goes to the restaurant waiter serves the food to the customer customer orders the food chef Cooks the food cleaning team cleans the table cleaning team cleans the restaurants restaurant has tables then finally customer pays the bill in the paste the money in the bill counter pays the money for the bill in the bill counter so this is the flow for the residence management system I hope you all understood thank you if you like this video please like subscribe and share it with your friends

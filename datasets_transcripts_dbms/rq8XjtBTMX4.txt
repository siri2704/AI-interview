welcome to my video series of database management system in this video you will be learning about er model er diagram in database management system this is my lecture 3 on er model you will be learning about what is an entity relationship model and the component the one of the component is attribute so you will be learning about attributes in this video what are the different attributes are there in er diagram so attributes in er diagram types of attributes with the help of an example so i request you please stay tuned till the end of this video please subscribe to my channel like and share this video thank you [Music] in this video of er model i will be training you how to create an eir model or a diagram of a given situation of a database so in this let's consider whenever we create a table in database directly and do the designing work without any modeling tool or language then database will face many issues problems when it comes to any update in the design of a table so that's the reason we use er model or er diagram i will be explaining you this with the help of an example let let's see what is an er model or what is an er diagram both are same ear model er model stands for entity relationship model entity relationship model entity is in real world object relationship how the real world objects are having a relationship among themselves in a database so this model is used to define the data elements and their relationship for a specific system for example i have a company of some production i have some production company so the in that production company i will be having different departments on the different data elements so how these data elements will be communicating among themselves will be specified in our database model the er model defines the conceptual view or design or blueprint of a database conceptual view or design or blueprint it means that before creation of a database before creation of a database will be having how the database look like how the database look like how the different elements of a database will be communicating so detail in detail that the er model will define everything how our data elements will be having a relationship so it is a high level data model er model is a high level data model used to model logical view of the system from data perspective from data perspective what is a data perspective how the data should be visible how the data should be visible how the data should be communicating how the data will be communicating with other data so it's a high level data model purely based upon data perspective having below components what are these components entities one component entity type is one component and entity set so in detail i will be telling about what is an entity what is an entity type what are entity sets so in er modeling database structure is portraited as a diagram called entity relationship diagram whenever we are going to create ear model conceptual view it's nothing but a diagram so that diagram is going to portray the basic structure how our database look like however database look like an entity relationship model that is er model describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram which is known as relationship diagram that is er diagram er modeling helps you to analyze data requirement systematically to produce well designed database so without er modeling we cannot create a database it will help us to analyze the data requirement systematically to analyze the data data requirement systematically and based upon our analysis we can produce well designed database as per the requirement so let's see this example of er diagram let's consider i have a table student table so physical table i have a student table varying i have stu columns or the field name such as student role number student name and its phone number let's consider i have another table college where i have the fields such as college code college address and a phone number now how these two tables are in relation as we know students will enroll into the college will enroll into the college for to learn some course so we can say student studies in college we can say student studies in college so studies will be the relationship between student table and college table so this is an table representation let's consider the same thing with our er model representation diagrammatical representation student table so here student table will be called as student entity in relationship model that is er model so student is an entity having the attributes student role number student name and student phone number so all these are attributes of our student entity and i have a college entity the attributes of college entity is college court college address and college phone number all these are its college entity attributes so this is my student entity and college entity in the above you can see student table and college table so in er diagram will be having entities so student entity and college entity so student entity having its own attributes college entities having its own attributes now what is our relationship the relationship is student is going to study in college student studies in the college so studies will be the relationship between student and college so this is a basic example of our er diagram let's see the components of er model so what are the different components so in er model we we have seen entity attributes and relations so these three are our major components these three are our major components of er model so what are these components entity attribute and relationship so every entity will be having attributes what is an attribute it's a characteristics of an entity characteristics of an entity so i have three components of er model that is entity attribute and relationship so let's see this entity so entity is of two types strong entity and weak entity strong entity and weak entity attribute so attribute will be of four types first key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute next coming to relationships i will be having unit unitary relationship binary relationship and enri relationship with respect to this relationship i will be having the cardinality constraints such as one to one one too many many too many many to one so all these are my cardinality constraints with respect to my relationships such as unreal bannery and henry what is an attribute what's an attribute attributes are the descriptive properties which are owned by each entity of an entity set every entity set will have attribute as we have seen the example of a pen pen is having a characteristics these characteristics are nothing but attributes every physical object or conceptual object or logical object which is considered in database will be having its attributes will be having its attributes so attributes are nothing but characteristics for example role number name date of birth age address mobile number are the attributes which defines the entity type student which defines the entity type students so it means that whenever any student is enrolled whenever any students is enrolled for any particular course it will be that student will be having a role number name date of birth age address mobile number so all these are nothing but its characteristics of a student so student characteristics are nothing but attributes so student will become entity type all this role number name date of birth age address mobile number will be called as its attributes so in er diagram attribute is represented by an oval shape which is represented by oval shape so there are four types of attributes that is key attribute composite attribute and multivalued attribute and derived attribute so what is key attribute what is composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute i will be telling in more in detail so what are the different types of attributes first is key attribute next composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute let's consider more in detail about them key attribute the attribute which uniquely define that is primary key each entity in an entity set is called key attribute coming to primary key and different types of keys i have created a detailed video on keys in database management system so link is provided in the i button as well as in description please learn about keys from my video keys and dependencies as well so in er diagram key attribute is represented by an oval with underlying for example roll number will be unique for each student so i have this student entity so every student will be uniquely defined in a student database how the students will be defined uniquely with their enroll number with their enrollment number so this enrollment number is nothing but their role number so this role number is a key attribute this is roll number is an key attribute of this entity set or entity type student next we have composite attribute an attribute composed of many other attributes is called as composite attribute is called as composite iterability for example address attribute of a student entity type consists of state city state and country in er diagram composite attribute is represented by an all comprising of alls such as i have the student here entity type student is having is having student name as in one attribute and student address as an another attribute so this address is a composite attribute such as it is going to have all these again attributes inside that address field will be having again fields such as street city state and a country so all this is nothing but our address attribute they are going to represent the address attributes so address attribute is a composite attribute okay which is a com composition of all these different attributes next we have multivalued attribute an attribute consists of more than one value for a given entity will be termed as will be called as multivalued attribute for example phone number can be more than one for a given student for example home phone number and office phone number so in er diagram multi-valued attribute is represented by double oval so let's consider this student type entity having student name and student phone number so student phone number is a multi-valued attribute multi-valued attribute so phone number is a multi-valued attribute in this entity set derive attribute an attribute which can be derived from other attributes of an entity type is known as derived attribute for example h h can be derived from date of birth so if we are having an entity set in the dentistry set if i have it attribute data but from the date of birth easily i can find out what is the age of a person so in er diagram derive attribute is represented by dashed so let's consider this entities type student having attributes student name date of birth and h so here h is in derived attribute how i am going to get the age age will be defined based on the date of birth of a student so age is an derived attribute ages and derive attribute in this entity set let's see the quick recap of this lecture 3 of er model so what are the different components of your model the three components first is entity next attribute and last is relationship in this video i have you have learned about the attribute so let's see the quick recap the attributes first we have the four types of attributes the very first is key attribute next composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute so what's a key attribute it's a primary field of a table example employee id student id etc will be termed as a key attribute in our relationship so companies attribute what is composite attribute is a combination of other fields such as address address is a combination of the different fields such as street state country next we have multi-validated attribute having more than one value in the field of a table such as phone number so a person can have more than one phone number derive attribute derive attribute is an attribute which is derived from some other field example is age so age can be derived from some other attributes such as date of birth so please stay tuned on my channel incoming videos you will be learning

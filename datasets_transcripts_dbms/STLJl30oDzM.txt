so it's all about data and you have any 
examples of data like whatever we use to store   is called your data it can be a customer 
information customer information in the   sense customer name customer phone number 
all those things are considered as your data   so this course is intend to have a database 
so database purpose is to store your data   okay so just going to a history why you 
need a database before inventing a database   what was there and what are the difficulties 
or disadvantages on storing the data before   the database what kind of system they used okay in 
that system what are the disadvantages they face   for this only they came up with the concept called 
database okay we will see that history first   so as i said you can see my screen you can see my screen guys 
yes yes we can see your screen see like um see you have a data right as i said 
the customer data so earlier before   the database invention and all how they are 
stored they started storing using a file system   say for example i can store 
this file as a customer info   okay so customer info so say for example i 
have a customer name and i have a phone number   something like that so name can be naga and my 
phone number can be 198674 something like this   and even i i no need to store in the same way like 
this i can store in the same way like this like   naga and 98765 my address can be 
in say for example i'm in koit   maybe someone else say for example varun his 
number is phone number is like this so i can uh   keep storing the data in this file system 
as well so this is how the conventional   storage of data has begun okay so when 
you keep storing the data like this data so when you have your data stored in a file system   and what complexities arises like windows 
have a restriction like you cannot have a   storage of a file more than 10 gb 5gb i'm 
not saying about today's high technology   i'm speaking 20 years back so they have a 
storage restriction of five individual file so they have a restriction we have a restriction 
of storage of a file okay so that is why you have the file system has other disadvantages 
over database okay now just a minute sorry guys i'm getting repeated calls okay let's 
continue so uh earlier they used to store the data   in the file system okay so you have a notepad 
or you can create a excel spreadsheet over here   you can keep storing the data in excel spreadsheet 
as also so this is the file system you have and   it's used to show the data it it also saves the 
same purpose as i said database used to store   your data and you you can even store the data 
in the file system so what disadvantages that it   had in a typical file system that makes you to 
create your database environment i mean that makes   you to create meaning like um made you to evolve 
the database architecture okay so challenges what   we face is like size of your data as i said if it 
is for a small environment if you are managing for   your own purpose then it's fine if you assume as 
an organization you will keep on adding the files   you will keep on adding multiple files and you 
will as you see like you can't able to take the   backups you store it here and you put it 
in e drive you have someone asked you to   verify where it is you find very difficult 
so first is size hello someone is speaking   okay so ease of updating so ease of updating means 
you can't able to easily update say for example in   the same file you have hundreds of customer the 
customer information has changed he has changed   the phone number you need to go and search assume 
you have multiple files like that you have 80 to   90 files you don't know in which file the customer 
data is stored so updating becomes very difficult   storing is easy initially you start okay accuracy 
as a these are more or less related accuracy   and updating everything is same and security so 
when you have a data stored in the file system   securing those files say for example as a 
manager i need to access only the payroll   i can access the payroll but the other employees 
should not access the payroll information   if i have all the information stored in my 
desktop like this this is your data and you have a   payroll information over here okay so you have 
payroll information so if this folder is success   to everyone say for example from the manager 
from the deal or your employees everybody can go   and see their payroll information how much they 
are paid uh what is the salary of my colleague   what is my manager's salary then that becomes 
unnecessary conclusion so that should be some   restriction to people who has to see what okay 
so security implementation is very complex here you can't switch between the screens hold on you can able to see guys i will teach you in 
this manner because switching between the screens   become very difficult so security restriction 
is there and that makes us life very difficult   and redundancy redundancy as you see like you have 
the same data you what you feel like you feel very   comfortable in taking backups you have one 
copy in d drive and use copy and paste in need   after some time you will not update in e drive 
or d drive you can you keep on adding multiple   backup sessions and whichever question you 
need to use you don't know after some time   so this redundancy of data and you will not 
have accuracy this is closely related and   incomplete data so incomplete incompletion 
in the sense uh you if that is like uh   some constraints are not defined in your 
file system say for example your employee   or your customer should always have some phone 
number so that you can able to create if the   in a file system you do not impose an restriction 
to it without having a phone number you can start   creating it so those kind of incompleteness you 
will keep on adding that becomes very complex   when you have your data stored in your file 
data storage so this is the main disadvantages   that earlier systems faced or earlier 
organizations faced so that it made us to   evolve and move towards the storing your data 
in your databases i think till this it's clear guys yes cool fine so coming to   the uh models now with this note let us 
see what are the things we have in this session so basic uh database concepts so basic database concepts and we 
have a introduction to sql server   so these are the things i'm going 
to cover why let's keep changing so introduction to sql ddl dml commands working 
with queries all these things will make you to   have a full sql developer that is sql server 
developer once you learn all these courses okay   so i think rabbani rahil wants more on the 
module six to seven eight nine ten those   things so they are familiar with the module 
till first five modules i think let's see   will this course will also cover the 
sql fundamental about data querying yes   yes that is what uh working with queries 
you have a module 6 over here hold on select   select insert update and delete those and joins 
yeah yeah so you see here working with queries   aggregate functions joins you can see 
my mouse pointer there drawings yes yes   so implementation of data integrity so basically 
it involves know about the database and using   sql okay i mean using sql and we use sql server 
as the dbms i'm going to quickly start uh that   session now that dbms all those things so this 
is your course content just go through it okay   because my job primarily to retrieve the data 
on if anything need to be updated or something   exactly so you learn all those things because sql 
means that is mandatory you need to create table   and updation querying coding is main 
path that comes with the dql okay okay   we will see so i have a tool modules here i'm 
going to take each module one hour and i will have   another half an hour to uh for i mean it will 
not completing one hour some classes will take uh   more than one and half hours so that's what i 
told a 14 hours session okay let's see how it goes okay give me a minute database management system so now i i 
told you about uh database i mean uh data   we discuss about data anything any 
information is your data okay so it   can be a customer information it can 
be your transaction uh it can be your   what to call payroll information employees 
and just use a mobile information emi number   i mean imei number your mobile model everything 
is a data okay anything any information   definition of data is nothing but any useful 
information is called your data and database   that is used to store your data that's all simple 
things okay and where this database management   system comes into place so if you read through the 
definition i think i'm not sharing the screen hold on so database management system if you go through 
the definition it says like it's a system   software for creating and managing your databases 
so first i started with data then i told what is a   database that is used to store your database 
then i'm telling another term called dbms   so this dbms is nothing but that stays in between 
your database and your user so it's a software   that is used to collect the data and 
store it in a database it acts as   interface so basic logic behind database is 
nothing but database management system okay so   dbms makes it possible for end users to create 
read update and delete database in the database   so it's nothing but a software written it's a 
program that makes you to create the database   and modify the database so in general term 
you will say databases only but indirectly   the all the works done by database management 
system it's nothing but your software   so now i said like i am teaching this database 
course using a microsoft sql server so it is   one of the vendor that is microsoft is a vendor 
providing this software so sql server is your   database management system you got the point and 
oracle is your another database management system   and ibm db2 is your database management system 
underneath what will have you will have databases   so databases is common okay that doesn't matter 
so ms sql server oracle all these things are   database management system i hope uh i'm clear 
in this point so how this database is architected   in the sense people will have data okay so 
people has to insert a data in different ways   like this the user can use the client tools 
or uh hold on so user will either use the   client tools or they they will use the apis like 
application programming if you assume you are   going for any online shopping they will use to 
collect your information it can be a card details   or any online application so this api is nothing 
but this top screen is nothing but your screen   front-end screens okay using that they will 
gather the data then using the dbms software   they'll store their information in the tbm i 
mean database okay it can be a mobile application   and it can be a video or any other things so your 
data can be anything basically it is not only a   text it can be a image it can be a video those 
things also can be stored in the database okay okay so nagi uh one question here yes so this 
uh you said like ms sql server and oracle   uh so like in in the real-time scenario like 
who decides like what should be like mongodb   we have different uh dbms so yes yes so who 
decides which uh rdbms to go correct yes yes yes   so it's a business card basically if you have all 
your products built in microsoft they always go   for microsoft sql server in some applications they 
used to go for oracle so purely based on the uh   business analyst or i will say architects so 
architects will decide based on the volume each   rdbms has its own advantages and disadvantages 
they need a parallel processing they need   multi-level tasking those kind of strings can 
be applicable only in ms sql server oracle will   not support that then they will obviously go for 
this so based on the business scenarios situations   they will go for each and every i would say 
rdbms i mean microsoft sql server because i   know that one i don't know about oracle this 
is a human mentality if you know what i mean   whatever you know you'll project it that's how 
it works most of the companies as simple as that   okay hope in my organization also 
uh they're using toad oracle yeah   toad and mysql is open source so it's uh i 
mean it's a free open source software so mysql   you they will not charge anything so that is 
rdbms that is i mean that is nothing but your dbms   database management system so this thing you need 
to be clear in mind okay so so the base concept   will be any different syntax or stay on the 
sql when you retry the queries or something   when we work on with sql microsoft risk well and 
when you were going with oracle will there be any   difference no so uh the concept behind this is 
database is common for everything and they if   they use sql structured query language okay that 
is common for everywhere maybe the syntax may be   different if you know the programming languages 
like c or c plus any programming language it has   its own syntax declaring a variable like 
uh you mentioned the data type integer   a or a comma integer it differs between the 
programming language similar syntaxes will differ   but they follow the sql then the syntax would be 
same slide differences will be there in some cases   i would say in our calendar sql server we have 
80 percentage same syntax for most of the cases   there are some cases for providing access those 
things the syntax will differ even uh if you learn   this sql it will be applicable for oracle and 
mysql everywhere you can use the same code okay   okay so with that note let's move forward 
so now you understand what it is microsoft   sql server is nothing but your dbms and what it 
will do it will enable you to create databases   the databases will store 
data now the question arise   like when you have files okay you are storing any 
type whatever i typed earlier okay yeah i typed   in the notepad i i can store it in excel like 
this or i can store it in a notepad like this move this window away so i can store uh 
anything like this i can store like this   i can store like this oh come 
on i need to fix this one what i'm saying is you see here i can store here   in this format any other format so in case 
of database how the data should be stored   so you you got my point you can see my 
screen on it's pausing this one okay hello is can you able to see yes yes yes yes yeah one minute i need 
to fix this guy i mean uh it's sharing   shot everything something like that screen 
hold on now i hope uh it's fine i don't want to   each time i am switching it's asking me okay fine   yeah yes share screen is fine now okay now you see 
like uh here you have a customer name phone number   i can store it like this i can store like this so 
that is uh any way i can store if it is a file i   can store like this also one one customer store 
i will say hurry and i will say like phone number   here i'm storing phone number here uh after his 
name in this next line here i can store like this   it's my wish there is no restriction in the 
file system but the database perspective how   you need to store the data so there is a 
thumb rule like in dbms you need to store   the data in tables it's pretty much clear okay 
so the tables are nothing but your spreadsheets   if you see here yeah so this is your spreadsheets 
are nothing but your tables if every i hope   everyone worked on excels so table is nothing 
but you have a rows you have columns okay this is   how the data should be so in order to store your 
customer detail you need to define customer name   you need to define i mean you need to define 
this column column customer name phone number   and address okay this is the thumb rule where your 
data should be stored i mean how the data should   be showed so your data stored in a table that is 
called your relational database management system   so i'm i told about database management system so 
there are different types of dbms object oriented   hierarchical no need to put much into it now the 
fold farmers everything is like rdbms relational   database management system where your data's 
are stored in a table pretty much clear okay now what is data field record database 
this is the hierarchy we need to follow   data as i said any information is your 
data field is nothing but your column   each column is your field technically speaking 
when a business perspective any application user   will say it has a field okay in database 
world it should be considered as column   okay so it's a column then record so record 
is nothing but you have defined the headers   so i am having one record here nagi 99765 an 
address i'm just typing just a country name   here in address so each row one row is called your 
rector or i mean it's it's called a row in a table   or it's a record okay that is what you say it has 
a record then database okay so i i created this i   i will name it as customer so whether this 
is considered as a database no this entire   thing is considered as a table so this thing is 
considered as a table okay now i create another table like payroll here i can maintain 
another information so this is how   the group of tables so a database can contain 
multiple tables this maybe i can say like entire   excel sheet this single excel sheet considers 
a database so this actual sheet is a database   and can contain multiple tables okay got 
it it is simple as that now with this all   these informations okay let us quickly know 
what is sql server all other stuffs like this come on so you you got now every idea about data database 
tables tbms okay as i said microsoft sql server   is your dbms rdbms relation 
database management system   so i have provided the link to you guys in the 
email i have sent you need to install the software   so that it will install microsoft sql server 
engine so the architecture comes like this okay i need to go back here say for example 
now i am saying about this two part   uh let me hand it this two part okay database and 
dbms so whatever link i provided in the email uh   that will install your sql server only 
okay this alone the center part alone   it will install the second software maybe i will 
quickly show it to you guys i need to go to maine okay so this.net framework is uh forget about this 
there is no concept related to sql server all this   sql server built-in dotnet code so that is why 
microsoft asking you to install forget about this   this is not related to our topic then sql server 
see this link is nothing but your sql server as   a dbms it is nothing but your server the dbms 
software okay this is what you need to install download now as i said you if you have a 64 
bit you choose this one if you have 32-bit   system you choose this one so this will these 
two will install your dbms then what about this   management studio it is nothing but your client 
tool to connect see server is the software as i   said it's a software just a software that will 
sit in your one desktop or server system i mean   any server dedicated server then you need a 
management studio to connect to that server   and you want to manipulate it create a 
database or you need to query it as you asked   you want to select or create tables whatever 
operations you do you need to have a client this   is management studio is nothing but your client 
okay so in this picture you don't have that kept   you assume this particular picture uh maybe 
i'll say this one as your management studio so   first link will enable you to create the dbms 
next link management studio you need to create   and uh database or all of the steps okay so i will 
help you if you find a difficulty in creating uh   i mean installing now i already installed dbms 
database management studium that is nothing but   uh sql server i am trying to connect with your 
management studio at a client once you install it so we need to choose 64 or 86 according to system 
requirement right yes yes based on your system you   need to choose either of those you have selected 
four options you choose any two that's enough what are the two options right um see i told 
you like here i mean x64 x86 you no need to   install both i mean download both check your 
system configuration in my computer like here   yeah i got it okay whether it's a 32-bit 64-bit 
you choose in my case it's 64 i'll choose this one   and uh this one that's enough then click 
next and go for it 1gb only and praveen told   he is having 32-bit so he installs 86 this one 
as well as this one you need to choose these two   then go for it okay just download and install 
it uh by default options next next next   then you will get all the environments like 
this okay now this is the client as i told   see this is my dbms i already installed 
it will go and sit you cannot see this one   unless you have the client tool just you 
have to connect the now this part uh like   this database won't exist only this one 
is existing okay dbms software now you are   connecting to the client then you are creating 
a database then you create table inside it okay   all these things you need to do manually 
once you install the dbms it will not have   database in place you are doing 
only the dbms at first place okay now already installed so this is my server name 
as i said this is the server you go to other   engines you forget about all those things server 
name i will give my server name then click on it so it is connected so this sql server 
management studio is your client   it's connected to your dbms that is sql 
server laptop this is the server name   and this will have all this architecture okay 
i mean we will go through it later now in order   to create database i already have some databases 
so in order to create databases one of the main   advantage of microsoft product is that you know 
minimal coding you don't need to write coding much   instead you can write i mean you can create using 
a gui so just right click on it new database i will say like sql training let's filling this wrong sql training corona fine so it's as simple as that just for the name   these file groups i will 
explain later just click on ok then you can see like sql training corona here 
okay these are database i already created so   once see this will contain the folder i mean 
uh databases inside this what we'll have   inside this one database under the database only 
you will have tables views all those things the   disadvantages whatever we face in the file system 
like security and you have a consistency i mean   the user should not have restricted access 
those things can be implemented using these uh   options okay we will while going through the 
sessions we will you'll learn that one now so this   is the database uh you can create it like this or 
you can choose this one you can create a new query new query uh i'll say create database uh i'll say   test two something like that okay this is also 
a way of creating it it's as simple as that so you have to here okay i don't want it just i want 
to show you guys how it has been created or how   it should be now we will stick to this so how to 
navigate see once you have your database in place   okay here you choose that database then press new 
query okay so now you see this is highlighted here   i mean let us have a spotlight you see 
highlighted here i mean sql training the database   then you can start writing it code now as i said 
you need to have the table to store the data so as   i said like here you have customer data so these 
are my customer data so you cannot copy and paste   and store it you need to create a table first that 
table only stores the information okay so instead   of wasting writing the codes i already prepared 
some kind of scripts over here i mean module three okay so first as i said it's a customer 
information so this is the syntax for creating   your table so it starts with create statement 
and what you are you are going to create create   table customer customer id customer name and 
address so these are the things i want to store   so just imagine with the excel example these 
are nothing but your columns or fields so you   are just creating a metadata that is headers 
okay uh so that these columns is going to hold   those information okay this is the 
column name and what about this   these are very important part nothing but your 
data types so any programming language or anything   which have data type meaning what is the type of 
your data say for example this customer id is set   as integer int integer is nothing but numerical 
values it will hold the values from 1 2 3 4 till   some limits 3 million or some million it will 
hold and customer name should be back here that   is character it should not if you put integer 
over here it will throw error in this case if   i want to insert nagi it will not allow so it 
is saying that restriction to your data what   data it's going to hold that is your data type 
type of your data you need to declare it there are   number of data types mostly we will use integer 
and worker we will go through it i will share you   the link that you can study what are the different 
types of data types and when to use this when to   avoid this what is the difference between 
varchar invest and we will go through it just   uh for now you focus on table this is the column 
names and these are the data types okay now   you see here i don't have any tables now it 
would by default it will have system tables   once i select this statement and do execute it has 
said completed successfully then do a refresh here   you find a table here okay this is 
the customer table now as i said   how i can see a data inside the table 
i cannot see like this i can see the   columns what are the columns all 
those things okay but i cannot have any data i mean i don't have any 
data it just creates the structure   now you see uh this is the data customer 
id customer name customer address okay   so there is no data and how you want to store it wow i'll know the answers okay fine so basically 
you create a schema or a structure and you want   to insert the data this is the only way you can 
insert into a table i mean you need to explicitly   switch by insert into what is that object name 
that is object name is nothing but table then you   need to mention the columns so this is john and 
he's from london now when i select this statement okay now i go and see the data here so 
one customer information is stored so   this is how your data's are getting stored 
in the database it's flat i mean it's flat   in the sense it will be row row so this 
is called a row this is called a field   this is called a field and this is each cell 
is a data okay this is how it is related   now let me insert some more values so 
that i can find uh something useful so now i have inserted two more records so 
this will have uh kumar abdullah bangalore   all those things so now you got a clear 
understanding about how you can store the   semicolon should we add 
semicolon at the end of the query should we add semicolon at the end of the query 
yeah as i said so it depends upon each dbms rdbms   in oracle you need to do in mysql you need to 
do what i studied when i studied actually i   was supposed to add a similar one at the end of 
this video yes that that's what i said so syntax go ahead go ahead come in but i i you did not 
add a semicolon at the end of the query yeah   yeah that's what so as i said uh this sql is a 
standard i mean whatever i written here is sql   each and every rdbms has its own syntax so in 
sql server there is no semicolon in mysql even   in oracle i'm not sure there might be a semicolon 
okay so there is no thumb rule so you need to   focus on one particular technology or querying or 
rdbms if you you once you're familiar then you can   compare while learning i recommend you focus on 
this for now then you go for a comparison okay   because you already did a study on that that's 
fine i'm saying here in sql server no need okay okay guys so this is your uh about the 
table okay now let's focus on your syllabus   so you see like the limitations of file management 
systems have covered basic concepts and advantages   uh basic concepts is like a server client 
architecture what is data field record   database exploring relational database management 
system understanding client server so mostly   this thing uh this is history basic futures 
components and tools yeah so you need to   uh starting and stopping these are very uh small 
things introduction to management studio whatever   i use this is the one types of system database 
in this field okay fine uh someone have any   question someone or something okay just say once 
again the relational database management yeah   so you you now you somewhat you are familiar 
about dbms's it's a software now so relational   database management system is nothing but 
uh every table is a relation i mean the   uh to refresh my sentence it's a software 
okay then what comes a relational database   management system you need to store a data in a 
relation manner so how it is relational manner   if you need to store it as a table so 
every table is a relation that is what   it's a relational database management system 
okay so how it is related let me explain with the   so basically dbms i explained now you see the 
customer id this london is related to this id   this london is not related to him so every 
table is a relation every column is specific   to this particular person it is not specific 
to this guy or this guy so this entire row is   called a relation they're building a relation so 
this entire table is called your relation okay not satisfied i think okay no no no i'm saying there are other ways of 
managing uh dbms object oriented hierarchical   relational so they consider everything 
as object oracle all those things   now relational management system is nothing but 
purely you need to store the data in a table that   becomes your relational database management 
system that's what the definition of it and   every table is a relation that's the com rule 
okay now uh let me explain some more thing about   services so back to this guy so this guy just 
sits as a service you see services dot msc you see here this is the guy sql server is 
nothing but your dbms database management system   that will run as a service this is running okay   now he is the one i mean uh we are 
running now when i stop it just see you run this query it will 
throw error it should throw let's keep on running because it doesn't find uh 
the instance earlier see a connection is broken   and recovery is not possible okay 
so basically this is the server   and the service okay which is enabling you 
to run the management studio i mean dbms   so this is the service you if there is 
some issues like this just go and check   the services connection is broken recovery 
is not possible something like that okay   let us start that so it is already running 
now when i go and run something i instead   of that i'll select this statement that will 
run immediately now it's working okay and your   management studio also will run as a service 
i think wait a minute microsoft sql not sure okay that is not as a service so this is 
your service and management studio as i said   you can go and check it here sql server   this management studio this is your client tool 
that is what you want to understand using this   only you told about toad toad is a client tool to 
connect to your oracle so it's not a database told   uh i think if i'm not wrong veron can you tell 
me oracle you use toad or some other client otherwise it's like uh ide integrated 
development environment kind of thing   so you can connect to server clients all of this 
thing so it's a client tools okay it's a client   basically so management studio is your client 
and your sql is down on underneath okay   so this is the things you need to know about then what system databases okay now see when i say like i connected this 
rdbms database management system when i right   click on it okay create new database it 
has created me a sql training database   with all the schema tables views 
synonyms all these things how it creates   basically this system database if you expand 
it this internally create a model database   master database msdb tempdb all those system 
databases to process basically this model   will have the all the content to be created when i 
just create a name so this will create a one copy   this is taken as a copy then this database is 
created so already they have defined how it should   create all the metadata over here okay so just a 
copy and paste and renaming it to whatever name   we provide that is what your model database and 
this master information by default all the data   should be stored metadata if you see like what 
is my system configuration all other stuffs okay   this should be stored in some key database 
that is called your master database   and i'm not pretty much sure about it but tempdb 
whatever processing you are doing say for example   it requires say select 70 plus 80 okay i typed 
something wrong 70 plus 80 is 150 very easy answer   so i'm running this so 150 is your answer so 
this requires some computation some memory power   to calculate so those calculations will reside in 
your tempdb so basically as a software it doesn't   do anything on its own all the things is doing 
using some kind of system databases okay so these   are the main purposes we will don't look much into 
it okay if you look into much into it you will get   confused we are never going to use that one just 
to for your understanding how they will create   all those things questions will arise for that i'm

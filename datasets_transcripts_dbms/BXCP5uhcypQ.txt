[Music] it is a collection of data are known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning or database in the context of another situation about database in the case of the database collection of data foreign collection it represents some aspect and it is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning logically coherent logically related to inherent meaning meaning data then it is designed built and populated with data for a specific purpose and thank you specific purpose and eventually number of databases um management system a database management system or dbms is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database so in a general purpose software system it is a general purpose software system that facilitates the process of defining constructing manipulating and sharing database among various users and applications about the general defining defining involves specifying the data type structures and constraints of data upon database [Music] and the definition is stored in database catalog or dictionary but you know databases second function is constructing constructing means the process of storing the data in some storage medium that is controlled by the dbms then manipulating functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data then updating the database and generating reports that allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously for multiple users simultaneously to access the dbms [Music] and maintaining it over a long period of time dbms functions protection the varna protection includes system protection against hardware or software malfunction or crash and security protection against unauthorized or malicious access databases system protection against hardware or software malfunctioning then maintaining maintaining the database system means allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time so the users or programmers they uh interact with the dbms software through application programs or queries application program so a on the software science in the vernacular course number under the computer science department and offer another our data structures and course number computer science department and then discrete mathematics on your course number under maths department and handling the course [Music] many characteristics then insulation between programs and data and data abstraction then support of multiple views of data and sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing characteristics first self-describing nature of databases so a database system is referred to as self describing because it's not only contains the database itself but also the complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints or database in the structure and then the constraints and the other complete description database in the codendo and this information is stored in dbms catalog and is called metadata description structure of each file type and data format of each item various constraints and the catalogue is used by dbms software the catalog uh dbms catalog using the dbms software ucm and by the users who need information about database structure database structure information uses the motherboard dbms software catalog and then next characteristic is insulation between programs system the structure of the data file is defined in the programs so if a user wants to change the structure of a file all the programs that access that file might need to but in contrast in the database approach the structure is stored in the system catalog database in the system catalog our database in the structural and and not in programs so such changes in the programs need not be required so the insulation between programs and data is also called program data independence within our programs of data in the installation other number program data independence number and the characteristic that allows program data independence is called data abstraction but your program data independence allows in our characteristic number uh data abstraction in that area then next characteristic of dbms system is support of multiple views of data each user of a database require different perspective or view of a database either basically uh foreign different multiple users in another dbms scenario functional then sharing of data and multi-user transaction processing another characteristic of dbms user transaction processing currency control concurrency control software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data do so in a controlled manner so that the result of the update is correct and either multi-user uh transactions are called online transaction processing applications being an application oltp application selling online transaction processing applications a transaction is an executing program or process that includes one or more database must ensure several transaction properties uh other transaction processing system properties ensure transaction properties day actors on the scene either database system selling different persons first a person is database administrator or dba dba is responsible for authorizing authorizing access to the database coordinating and monitoring its use and acquiring software and hardware resources as needed databases and they are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the database and for choosing appropriate structure to represent and store this data above the database are the people whose jobs require access parametric end users sophisticated end users and standalone end users casual end users the internet they use database very occasionally occasionally access the database but they may need a different information each end users they spend most of their time in querying and updating databases using standard types of queries in a database then sophisticated end users sophisticated users uh users like engineer scientist and business analyst who access the database to implement their own applications to meet their complex requirements after the complex requirements they maintain personal databases by using ready-made program packages that provide easy to use menu based graphics based or graphics based interfaces with graphics based interface occur you see the wound operatively personal cardinal data story and we need to database you see now everyone stand alone and a system analyst and application programmers application programmers they implement these specifications and programs specifications as programs then they test uh debug uh document and maintain these transactions next video

third normal form to bring a database to the third normal form its tables must be in the second normal form and there should be no transitive dependency in such tables a transitive dependency occures when nonk columns are determined by the values of other nonk columns nonk columns should not attempt to play the role of case in a table let's look at an example the table is not in the C normal form because product name is transitively depend on order ID through product ID that it's uh product name depends on product ID which in turn depends on order ID to bring the table to the thir normal form we must eliminate the transitive dependency by creating a separate table to store product information

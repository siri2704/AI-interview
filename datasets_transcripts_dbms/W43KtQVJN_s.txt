hi everyone this is Arun here welcome to my YouTube channel Arun tech for you in this video we are going to learn about entity relationship model so friends if you are new to my video and if you want to learn dbms you can go through my channel playlist in Channel playlist you can find a folder called dbms where English videos are available and there is another folder dbms in telu where telu videos are available and if you don't want to miss my video please subscribe my channel and don't forget to like and share my videos coming to topic ER model okay so let us start ER model okay so er model is nothing but a entity relationship model we also called as ER model okay so describe the structure of a database with the help of diagram so what it will do it will describe the structure it will show how a database look like okay so which is also known as ER diagram okay so what we use ER diagram okay so an ER model is a design or a blueprint of a database that can later be implemented as a database so what we are saying it will show the structure of a database with in a diagrammatical format for example if you want to construct a home what you'll do first you'll go with the blueprint okay so you'll just see how how the building can be constructed not paper right a design after that you'll go for a construction same way here to see how our database is designed we use ER model okay so er model is used to describe the structure of database okay right so there are lot of components of diagram sorry ER diagram so components of ER diagram are entity attribute relationship so what are there entity attributes and relationship and uh in entity again we have a strong entity weak entity in attributes we have SIMPLE attribute composite attribute multivalue attribute derived attribute key attribute and in ER model again one to one one to many many to one and many to many so let us see one by one right so first let us start with entity then we'll go with the attributes and relationship so first entity uh an entity can be Place person object event or a concept what you're saying a place person object event or a concept so it can be anything right so it can be place it can be person it can be object it can be event or it can be a concept right which stores data in a database uh this will store the data in the database okay the character characteristics of entities must have attributes and uni key so what characteristics of entity contains attributes and uni key so remember attributes and uni key okay every entity is made up of some attributes which represent the entity okay so attributes we'll discuss about the latter okay so first let us see some of the examples of entity so as we said it can be person it can be place it can be object it can be event it can be concept right so let us take two two examples of each okay so examples of entity for example if it is person we can say employee student patients okay for example place store building okay we can also say store building City okay we can also take others objectives like machine product car bike bus also you can take some other okay events like sales registration renewal uh concept like accounts scores all these will come under the entity examples of entity right okay now entity you know it is divide into two one is strong entity and weak entity strong entity will represent in the form of single line and we entity will represent in the form of double line so let us see what is the strong entity and we entity little bit uh in depth okay so strong entity uh an entity represented as uh rectangle okay see you can see it is in the rectangle in the ER diagram in following ER diagram we have entity bank which can be uniquely identified see bank is a entity now and it is strong entity and represented with a single line okay so weak entity uh an entity that cannot be uniquely identify see without bank no bank account right so it cannot be uniquely identified and it realiz on the relationship see it is not Independent Bank is independent bank account is dependent see without bank we don't have a bank account right so bank account is depending on bank account okay so that is called weak entity okay and we entity represented with the double line see okay for example you can see bank account so a bank account is a unique entity because it cannot be identified uniquely and it depends on the bank right okay so that's the difference between a strong entity and we dependent independent unique not uniquely ident okay single line double line right now let us move to the attributes uh attributes describe the property of an attribute okay an attribute is represented as o in a ER diagram so how they are represented in a o okay o or you can also say as ellipse so there are five attributes okay simple attribute see single line simple attribute is simple single line composite attribute combination combination of attributes multi multivalue attribute double line and derived attribute dotted and key attribute will be sing single line but underline so let us see one by one okay simple attributes see for example uh role number student is a entity right RO number is a uh single attribute or you can also say simple attribute simple attribute is also called single attribute okay so it is represented with the single line see okay example student role number see role number cannot be further divided okay for for example if RO number is divided then it is called composite attribute okay right composite attribute an attribute that is combination of uh combination of other attributes is known as composite attribute for example see Street City country is there combination of these attributes we can called as address right okay for example in strong student entity student address is composite attribute and an address is composed of other attributes like pin code State country so all these combination will become a composite attribute right so combination of attributes is called as composite attribute right next multivalue attribute uh if a if attribute has multi values for example phone number will uh we contain more than one but RO number only one right RO number only one name also one one name you'll have you may have first name last name but name will be single okay you will have not have two or three names okay but phone numbers you can have mail IDs also you can have more than two okay right so attribute that hold multiv values is called is known as multivalue attri okay right the name itself says multivalue it represented with the uh double double O okay double line o okay for example a person will have more than one phone number so phone number is a multivalue derive attribute uh which is derived from other attribute okay so derive attribute is one whose value is dynamic whose value is dynamic and derived from other attribute see for example if you join in an inter College from 10th your age will be 15 or 16 right same if after 2 years you will join in the degree so your age will be 17 or 18 so here what is happening age is dynamic it is changing right and it is derived on data birth see what it depend on data birth so suppose you given data birth they can easily find your age so age is depending on data birth so it is not independent right okay so it derived what it is age is derived from the data of bir so it is derived from other attributes okay for example person age is derived attribute as it changes over time and can be derived from the another attribute see what I said for example you can also take another example date of joining employee employee will have a date of joining and experience see based on is date of joining uh they will give experience certificate for example a person is leaving from the institution so in organization so what happen based on date of joint they will give experience certificate sorry right so that now experience certificate is what it is experience is derive attribute from the date of joining right so here date of birth is a main attribute from their AG is taken so that's why derive attribute is represented with the single lines right next key attribute uh key attributes are uh nothing but a unique identifying attributes for example uh we we have a AAR card number right so what AAR card number means it's a unique number so if you if you have duplicate a card number what happens for example same a card number is given to other person what happens you cannot be easily identified right suppose there's a four pH number phone number you are not having a unique phone number what happen some people Tres you may connect or some other people may so sometimes what happen they require a unique values so that values are called key attributes so with them only we can ID find for example in a college a student can be identified by the role number even University they will give you the memos how with the help of role number for example a role number is not unique what happens they cannot issue the memo right so a memo uh uh if a role number is duplicated so the same certificate can be used by the different people right so that's why a key uh key attribute is a unique one so which is helping to uh identify the entity uniquely right okay right so now you with this a small diagram you can easily identify what is the uh key attribute key attribute see underline will be there okay simple attribute single line will be there multivalue attribute double line one number composite attribute combination derb derived from the date of joining and it is represented in the form of dotted okay so these are the different attributes a simple diagram will explain you everything right okay now let us move to the relationships uh relationship uh it is represented by a diamond ship see Diamond ship is used to represent a uh we can also say as rhombus okay so it shows the relationship among the entities okay so there are four types of entity one to many one one sorry one to one one to many many to one many to many so let us see one by one one so first uh one to one one to one for example one entity on the right side and one entity on left side for example a student can opt one course a course is given to only one student so a student is only one and course is also one so one 2 one one student can choose one course and one CH course can be choosen by one student right okay next one to many uh one to many means here uh right side entity will be one left side entity will be many okay one to many for example a class will contains many students but many students will have only one class okay for example a class contains 60 students one 1 d section is there so a class contains 60 students 60 students will contain only one class see that's why many to one to many okay so student will not have many sorry um student sorry a class can class can be only one and student can be many right so that's why it called one to many so if you reverse this one then it is called called many to one for example student if I take on the right side sorry left side and class I take on right side what happens see many to one so many students will have only one class right next many to many uh many faculty see faculty will teach many students and many students will uh thought by faculty right faculty has many students and students has many faculty that's called many to many right so once again this are the entity model okay so which contains which is diagrammatically representing database and it contains entity attributes and relationship an entity strong entity single line rectangle weak entity double line rectangle simple attribute contains uh s single line uh o composite attribute combination of uh attributes multivalue double line derive attribute dotted lines and key attribute again single line but underlined the attribute okay so relationship one to one one to many many to one and many to many right now if you want to draw a college diagram for example we want to draw a you want to prepare a ER diagram so let us see how to prepare a ER diagram okay so for example ER modeling for college database I want to prepare a ER model for a college database so first we have to do what we have to do we cannot blindly draw a ER diagram first thing is we have to get the requirements what are there for example a college will have many departments right okay same way each first we have to list out the requirements each department should offer many course see every Department should ask for many course many lectures can work in Department see a department contain many lectures of course but a lecture can work only in one Department see a lecture can work in one Department okay so Department contain many lectures right but lecturers cannot work in different departments right okay for each department there will be one head head is nothing but H okay so every Department science department physics department will have a separate lecture can be headed only by one Department see okay and uh same the reverse of this one okay each lecture can take only uh take any number of courses the courses can be taken by one lecture a student can enroll for any number of course and each course can have any number of students okay so these are the requirements now one by one let me make you understand how to write a er er diagram okay so first what we have to do we have to write the steps to create the ER diagram so first entities second identify relationship third identify attributes fourth key attribute then we'll go draw the diagram so first for example entities so what are the entities we required to prepare a college uh College database we required Department course lecture and student four uh four entities now we have finished entities next uh relationships so relationship first uh one course is taught by only one lecture see one course is taught by one lecture but one lecture teaches many courses so many courses Tau by one lecture so courses of many lectures is one right okay next one Department May uh one department has many lectures see but one lecture belong to one Department see Department contain many lectures but all the lectures can have only one Department right same way one Department offers number of courses but one particular course can be offered only by one Department see Department can offer many course and course can be offered by one Department right department has only one head see department will have one H and one H will only leads see same H cannot lead other department right last one courses uh many students can enroll many uh courses see there are many courses there are many students so student will go opt any course and any course can be enrolled by the student so students also many courses also many so then it is called as many to many relationship okay now we have done with our uh relationship okay next uh attributes so for example department will have D ID D name place for example next uh course will have course ID course name duration fee uh lecture lecture will have see uh because of insufficient p i taken in this way okay so lecture ID first name last name address and phone number next student entity will have a role number first name last name address and phone number right so these are the now entities and attributes okay previously we have also seen the relationship between the entities now let us go key attributes uh key attributes for example Department ID see we have underlined the key attribute Department ID will be the key attribute for Department course ID will be the key for the course lecture ID will be the key for the lecture and role number will be the key for the student right okay so now we have also identify the key attributes now let us draw diagram first we'll draw Department attributes course attributes student attributes lecture attributes right now we'll join this how right now let us see see a course see multiple course can be offered by one Department many to one okay so same many students can enrolled into many courses so many to many so see one lecture Will T many course so many to one one department will have many lectures right so one to many one one head see one department will buy uh one h o see one head okay so one lecture will head the department so one to one of course department will have many lectures but only one lecture will be a head of Department right uh see so this is how we represent the ER diagram nice right so friends if you like this

hey everyone as we all know your board exams are coming by very fast so this would be the right time to start preparing for all your optional subjects as well in this video we will be covering Information Technology course code 402 for class 10th I welcome you to this channel my name is Akash Singh I graduated from it Bombay I'm an engineer by profession and in this video I'll be trying to simplify the concepts of rdbms for you so with without any further delay let's look at the topics which we are going to cover in this session datab database what is the need for database before we jump into SQL and SQL queries con database objects what are the various data types which are present inside a database so once we learn these we can jump on to the next part primary keys composite primary Keys foreign keys and candidate Keys definition as well as Concepts after that we will jump onto the theoretical part of referential Integrity as well as relations so this would be the first half of the session second SQL how you can create queries information ex what are the commands that you can use so ddld DML commands we'll be covering after that we will have look have a look at commonly used commands just create select update delete as well as drop so once we do all this the cover we can have a look at practice examples for these queries so this is the agenda for today's video so let's move on to talk about something very huge and something quite common in India so we are talking about Adar let's take an example I have an Adar you your family your friends might have an Adar so there are around 130 CR people in India just an approximate value I'm not very sure sure about what it is now so let's think of Adar card as a set of information name present it has your address your parents name mobile number your gender as well as your age so so for one person all this data is stored inside this card or inside some sort of a database right so for this person just multiply it by3 how do you store so much of data what would be the right form to store such data so name address age Etc and so on so in this table you can first add your first person then second person third person and so on you can add the details for about 130 CR persons so this entire table is actually known as database so now forar single table multiple taes so that's why a database would have multiple tables if it is quite huge so I think now you have an idea database use let's jump into some specific theories some specific topics about database so let's look at a simple class marks table so in this table we have the role number we have name English K marks Hindi K marks and Mathematics marks so these fields or these columns will be storing the data for which you are adding some records basically Fields columns rows they are called records for the first student it this entire thing is known as record one for this thing it is known as record two and so on so when you combine these rows and columns it definitely gives you a table am I right quite common sense common knowledge so this table is actually a very systematic way to store all of data so database is nothing but collection of data which is stored in a very systematic man Manner and by systematic what we mean pros and columns so what is the use for this what is the advantage and also there are very low chances duplicate data add so that's why databases are used in order to store data so that later on you can extract the data which you need now you might be thinking who creates this database use so talking about how database is created first of all they are created by designers so they are generally a group of software Engineers or a single software engineer database create he talks about how many tables should be there then comes the part of Administrators once the designers create the database database tables create this give it to administrators administrator have all the Privileges as well as the rights it's similar to saying Microsoft Windows create and now they're handing it over to you you are the administrator of your own PC or your own computer system and then finally end users which actually add data or maybe alter data Okay so now this data it can be organized into two types for example a class of 40 students so having a simple table like this would suffice so this is known as a flat file flat file Miss single table looking at the cases Rel now relational database is a collection of multiple tables which are connected to each other for example I have this table student ID student course ID which he or she has taken now this table is connected to this course table J course ID common and we have other columns like course name yeah for department and similarly this table is also connected so with the use of relational database data multiple tables store without getting confused if I try to store all this data in a single table it will be very big and it will be also quite confusing to sort data later on so now we have understood what a database looks like who creates the database users Corner administrators Corner we can finally start looking at the building blocks of a database they are also called database objects type first of all tables as we have already discussed collection of rows and columns queries now when you start asking questions to the table which student got the maximum marks in mathematics so that is a question also called a query that is another database object next is forms now as we discussed users they can add some data or maybe delete some data so in order to help the users so that they can easily add or delete stuff we have something called forms it is exactly similar to any other form that you might be filling for example data inside these fields now after I press enter all these data will be stored as a record where inside another table already once I press enter all this data will get stored directly inside the table now there is also something else known as reports we'll be covering that later next up is what kind of data can you store inside a database we all know the very common types of data text Data decimal numbers integers mixture of numbers and text so let's quickly have a look integer number 5 7us 8 these are all integers inside dbms rdbms there are multiple types of integers size difference they can only store integers in them for example if I use small in the size will be five five digit normal integer use the length is 10 if you use big in generally size that is 20 next is float or also known as decimals so decimals may be multiple types for example decimal data type use it will give you size 15 if you use float it will give you size 7even so you don't have to recall all these sizes you just need to have an idea actually database type of datas data types add so next up is Text data type now this is important difference in your examinations there are two types of text Fields first is character it has a fixed length of 15 spaces or 15 characters the other one is variable character this V actually stands for variable character mention size you can leave it empty it can store any length of data type generally variable character address for example in your because so for that we allot a random a flexible size of character data type next up is date and time data type generally used for storing date of births admission date purchase date amaz you can see the date there like second of February 2023 and then there is also time stamp like 2 and 2 to 4 p.m. so all those data types come under date and time type there is another another type of unique data type yes and no so for example uh do you want additional services along with this product you can select yes or you can select no so generally they are represented by ones and zeros and the length of this field you can only choose one so the length of this field is one all right so this is called a query but you don't have to look at this now what you need to look at is the types of data that each column is storing let's say I hope not next is student ID or you can also say that it is a role number there're always integers decimals RO number next up is birth date so this will be using a date data type not date time test result you can score 14.5 you can score 15.75 so that's why decimals again your grid can be in the form of a b c d That's that's why Text data type us and if you have passed or not it can be only one of those so booo yes or no or ones and zeros so this is how data types are necessary inside any data database create say name column what kind of data do you want to store in that so we have a quick idea how database works now what kind of data types are used let's move on to relational database Management Systems now single table now we will start looking into something more complicated but very useful as you have discussed before rdbms May relational extra word this is because we store data in multiple tables which are interconnected with each other generally the rdbms looks like this let say this table can be connected to this this to this and this to this so why is this necessary sometimes table through S information that's why you need other tables also so once we look into relational database there is a concept of keys a key is generally used to uniquely identify any record inside a table let me give you an example your AAR number is unique why is it unique because one AAR number only points out to a single person similarly a role number inside a class or any standard should only point to one student which means number I can understand that there is this person who lives here and whose age is this similarly if I know the rule number of a person in the class I can directly point out to him or her and know his name and his marks in various subjects so primary key which can uniquely identify each row in a table so AAR number number as well as your role number they are primary Keys which uniquely identify so please note primary Keys cannot be duplicate inside the table number similarly number students so sometimes what happens is 1 2 3 4 but in some tables for example let's look at this table so in this column this and this are duplicate this and this are duplicate so how do I identify a record just by using one column so at that point of time single column through uniquely identify you try to combine two or more columns customer order ID and product ID combine so I will get a unique value 001 comma P 001 which is unique in the table so this combination which can identify a row uniquely is known as composite primary simply speaking composite greater than two colums so something like this going do columns join key and then we are creating a composite key forign key is nothing but for example RO number primary key now this role number inside another table can be called a foreign key in the same table primary Keys itself but in some other table which it is pointing to is known as a foreign key so these concepts are quite easy you just have to go through them once primary key and foreign key difference primary key is INS inside its own table but in another table a primary key becomes foreign key now there is a concept of candidate Keys as well so let's talk about that so I have a table like this my table multiple columns which can actually be primary Keys ID all values are unique I can create this as a primary key I have role number which is also unique so I can create this as a primary key registration number is also unique so I can also create this as a primary key so collection of all these Keys is known as candidate keys they are actually the candidates to become a primary key similarly speaking if there are multiple ministers for the position of prime minister this is the same scenario over here so this was the concept of keys we talked about primary key it uniquely identifies a record inside a table we talked about foreign key primary key in one table is called forign key in another table composite primary key and candidate keys are those which have the potential to become the primary key so let's say if in this table I have selected this as the primary key so rest all will be called as alternate Keys okay so this was the concept of keys so let's move on to a more theoretical concept of referential Integrity so referential Integrity questions so let's understand what it actually means it is nothing but a rule in rdbms which actually States up be foreign key present here what is the definition of foreign key that a primary key in another table is known as foreign key so which means soal Integrity this key must have this key it cannot happen but foreign key this cannot happen so why is this necessary let's say I have two tables like this column one and column two and this is again column one and column 3 Let's just name them so foreign key it is mapping to primary key in this table now all of these values should match which are present inside this table it cannot happen value and corresponding value available so what is the benefit of this referential Integrity it gives us consistency of dat dat extract so if it's kind of confusing that's okay let's have a look at an example so that now I have two tables when we talk about reference Integrity first of all it is a topic of rdbms relational database management system more than one table so I have two tables here first is customer table also known as parent table and the next table is balance table also known as child table present take so the columns we have are customer ID name purchase paid amount balance basically customer what is the balance which is left also we have customer ID as the primary key now there is a second table called balance table customer ID and customer ID so according to referential Integrity it states that up child 106 so this is not possible if you're following the rule of referential Integrity similarly if I want to add a new value here say 107 it cannot happen because again 107 available what will it point out to 107 balance is 7,000 okay customer ID will I be able to do that no I won't be able to do that because it is not present there similarly if I have 104 as customer ID in this table and it is mapping to 104 in the child table now delete I will not be able to do that why let's say I delete this record now what will happen there will be a value in the child table which is 104 and 5,000 just primary key corresponding record so this is again not possible so referential Integrity is nothing but a rule which states that up value C delete from the parent table if the value is already present inside the child table and the next thing is the value cannot be inserted in the child table if it is not present in the parent table so this is the meaning of referential integrity why this helps it helps you because dat consistent and accurate so this is referential integrity next up when we talk about rdbms is obviously the relationship between tables rdbms multiple relations so there are multiple kinds of relations present so first is one to one column table is m mapping to another table for example your Adar one to many table connected and many to colum colum and again like this so let's take an example first of all one to1 relationship is something like your Adar number just say Adar number can only point to one person so let's say I have this person information table number name and there is another table called person detail table AAR number address contact and email yes so we can say that this is pointing out to only one name and again in this table it is only pointing out to one record or one person so this means we have a one to one relationship key details that is not possible second is one too many let's say you're studying in 10th standard multiple projects multiple subjects like mathematics computer and science so if I have a student table student ID available and I have the names available now one student can have multiple projects or multiple subjects right so project table ID 101 is mapping to multiple records in the project table why because student projects so this is one to many function or one to many relationship now many to many looks something like this just student table student ID and according to that there is name associated we have a course table which is different there is nothing common between these two tables I have course ID and I have course name okay now I have this table J student ID is mapping to this and the course ID is mapping to this right so we have something like many to many this is known as the many to many relationship now very easy to remember one to one many to many and one to many okay so now we are almost done with the concepts of rdbms just a couple of more things that you need to look at what is auto value now if you have seen an Excel sheet or Google sheet Auto colum atically let's say I have about 1 2 3 4 I have four rows in a table if I add another value over here names A B C D if I add e then it will be automatically numbered as five so Auto Value is nothing but Auto numbering entry required meansi length decide it is the maximum number of characters for the data field decimal places accy 3.14 3.14 default value is for the places Java pass buan entry either yes or no if the user does not select anything automatically select so format example is not in your syllabus let's move on to queries now as we have discussed before what does a query mean it means you're asking a question to the table or the database the questions can be like this student inside a school inside a college which student of your class has scored 85% or above marks first of all just try to think can these questions be answered by a table yes they can because name role number marks performance again if we are looking at Cricket World Cup we have tables for each match matches toal run SC how many balls were bed how many wickets were taken table so you can also answer answer this question who became the man of the match the person who has scored the max runs or most wickets that's how you can find out man of the match B and actually who won the match something like who scored the most goals inside a match right so these questions can be answered via queries queries questions so in B mseries and it will give you an answer based on some criteria and the result is displayed separately in another table origin no if you have a table original table when you use a query query use you will be displayed another table according to what you have asked or it can have multiple rows so in rdbms when we try to write queries they are written in a language called SQL or structured query language you might have seen that Apache open Office use school and you might be also using MySQL what is the difference between these two so open Office gra user interface what is the criteria what are the results you want to get displayed so that is graphical user interface but in my SQL when you write a query it is generally a single line of code a line of code and the database will answer your question so so if you ask me which one's easier I think my SQL is easier if you know structured query language because question database all right so now we know structured query language May up questions datab what does it allow you to do tables create tablete right whatever is related to the table columns and rows you can also change the data which is already present inside the database so there are two things that you can do create an alter tables or update tables with new data or delete some data so these are also called data definition language where you define the structure of a table and data manipulation language where you manipulate the data you can maybe update it or maybe you can change it so we will have a look at these two types of commands ddl commands and DML commands so data definition language delete first of all we have the create command you can create a new database or you can create a table syx when we look at the examples we will actually see what is the actual syntax but for now just try to understand D commands if I want to create a table like this I will use a create command if I want to modify the structure maybe I want to add a column C column D or maybe I want to delete this part so alter command when I want to completely delete the table I use the drop command now one thing to note is the difference between drop and truncate so drop drop table delete but when you use trun it only the rows will be deleted column names they will stay the same so this is the difference between drop and truncate also you can rename your table so from your board's point of view the important things to remember are create alter and the difference between drop and truncate so these are the important data definition language commands if you find SQL queries to be difficult I would suggest that you practice five questions from each of these queries and I promise you you will be able to score full marks in your SQL part okay so next up is data manipulation language sorry for the error here it is not definition it is Data manipulation okay so what does data manipulation mean we are trying to update the data or maybe some delete some data the most important command in data manipulation language is the select command for example if you want to display the marks for everyone who got over 70 in their board exams so we will use a select command basically it is used to display the results so when we said if you want to ask some questions to the table or the database most importantly command use and it is very important so next up is inserting to insert data into a table like this if I want to insert a new row I will be using an insert command so please make a note what is the difference between alter and insert alter like adding a new colum but extra data use data add that's why if only a row is inserted we use the insert command next up is let's say I have some data like this and I want to update this part or maybe along with this part I want to change it to 17 and this to 19 so the command which we use is update command again it is used to update the already existing data inside your table next up is delete now earlier drop and trunet they were changing the structure of the entire table but when we use the delete command delete command we are only deleting specific data part delete or maybe part delete so this is the basic difference between data definition language and data manipulation language you need to remember this again let me just repeat it for you when we change the structure of a table I'm data definition language structure additional Colum column delete or maybe you can delete all the rows or the entire table there is nothing related to the data already present inside when we talk about data manipulation language so when we talk about data manipulation language what we try to do is we try to change the data which is already present ins inside the table like this maybe update or maybe delete or we can also delete the entire row so I hope till now you have understood what is the use of SQL SQL queries typ where you change the table and where you change the data now let's try to look into some examples now please uh focus on this part as it is important this entire video will be enough for your board examinations so let's say we are creating a table what are the things that we need to Define sub I need the table nameable I need the column names right I need to understand colum and corresponding to each column name data type so the syntax looks like I want to create a table what do I want to create a table whose name is what then you can Define your own table name then I start mentioning the column name and the corresponding data type just say column name one space data type comma column name two space data type three data type comma and so on always remember that the queries should end with a semicolon semic end of statement and inside MySQL Query execute because compiler that your statement has ended so this is the syntax you want to create what a table and then you define the name and then write down the column name with the corresponding data type so understand this take a while we'll look at at an example now so let's say I want to create a table named client so this is how you can create it sub I have the create command what do I want to create a table name is client then I start the parenthesis between the parenthesis I write client ID is column 1 what is the data type it is integer data type I can store only numbers column two name is first name data type is variable character with with length 20 column 3 is last name again type is variable character this length 20 again C4 mobile number is variable character with 20 what do we get after this we get a table like this which is definitely empty that's why it will create an empty table so something like client ID post name last name and mobile number okay so this is how we use the create command very important command next up is if I want to now insert values inside the table so there are two ways to do this either I can add the entire row or I can add data inside specific columns so method one we are specifying values to be inserted along with the column names so what we write I want to insert into then we write the table name for example client then I mention all the columns separated by a comma inside parenthesis then values what values do I want to add value one value two value three so please note you need to add two values you cannot only add one Value method two is where we only add the values so so sometimes in a table we can have multiple columns like C1 C2 C3 C4 if I want to add values to only specific columns like this then I have to mention the column names but at times colums I don't need to mention all the column names I can only say insert into table Canam and values whatever I want to add okay value one separated by comma inside parenthesis and a semicolon don't forget that so let's look at examples now empty table for all the column names okay so I say insert into the table name is client when client table and then I say only values what I want to insert only values but at this point values so I say one2 Shani Jen and the phone number so this row will be added please note the phone number does not matter so just ignore this part okay just by mentioning insert command and all the values that you want to insert but what if I just want to update the client ID and the first name insert into client the rules con CL client idid comma first name so these are the columns my data add and then I say values values coni 103 P comma always remember numbers you can directly write it as a number but at times text always use inverted commas which means that this is a text data type and then finally end it with a semicolon next up is the select command again very important we have seen how to create a table now we will look at uh how to display the elements or the data from the table first is when you want to display the entire table we say select star select star all please remember star means all values so select all from the table name this is the basic syntax example example table display complete so this is the command which I use next is retrieving data only from the specific Fields so you just want to display the client ID and the first name so this is the syntax I say select the column names which I want to display separated by comma then say from and the table name example I want to select client ID comma first name from the table Cent client ended it with a semicolon and what will be displayed client ID poost name this so this will be displayed if you use this command I hope that was clear next is particular filters if you want to find out which student or which students got marks greater than 80 or 75 this is the statement views so syntax looks like select all from the table name where there is a specific condition now this specific condition can mean marks greater than 70 or age greater than 18 or marks l less than 35 condition true and false for example this is a table called customer I have the probably some ID I have a name first name I have a last name some sort of other ID to and the City so I want to select the customers from all the places Del this one this one this one and this one so what I say select star from customer all the columns from this table J City equals Delhi so again this Delhi is an inverted commas because it's a text so this is the column and all the places Delhi which means means this will be displayed this will be displayed display and be display so I hope you are understanding the use of Select command you can also display only the selected columns then you can also create conditions condition according dis right so again if I do not want to select all the columns customer ID or first name display from the table called customer I can also do that I can only display this as well as this so display this one this one this and this so you can select either all or specific columns just up display so now sometimes if you want to see the marks am by saying order by so if I order by first name select star from customer this is called the customer table order by first name to first name according ascending order dis according to the name but if I want to sort out by descending order by default it is ascending but if I want to display it in a descending order the query becomes d e s c so this is what you have to add in the end again you can create any query like select star from T clam student order by mathematic marks right and you can also say descending so you need to practice how to write queries generally statement div so that it becomes cleaner but when we are using MySQL so this was about select command next is update command as the name suggest update let's say I want to update someone's City or if I want to update someone's last name this is the command which we can use update table name what do we want to update table and along with that we need to use the set keyword what do you want to set column one as value one the point to be noted is you also need to set a condition Val so I can say something like this update customer table set first name as Kavita and last name as Gupta where customer ID is 102 so what happens you go to 102 you set first name as Kavita you set last name as Gupta okay so this is how you use the update command always three things you need to remember update the table name then you need to use the set command where the condition is true and the next important command is the drop command command so drop command means you are deleting the entire table table delete so this is the use of drop command so I hope you were able to cover all the topics today there is something else known as the delete command this say data delete please ignore this so let's say I want to delete from students where rule number is 104 you want to delete the entire row rule number 105 so again insert into and delete from General basic English language SQL and you need to always specify a condition where role number is 104 okay so these are the commands which you need to remember quite important I'll be coming up with a practice video questions practice but I hope you all have your text books SQL query based questions so I'll definitely try to share a few practice papers with you but till that time understand all these Concepts and try to implement them on their own because this is the time and if you just focus for a couple of more days I think you will be able to score maximum marks in Part B if you found this video useful or if you think some of the other people might find it useful just press the like button I'll be very grateful to you if you have any doubts you can comment under my video as you know if you have not already subscribe to the channel it would be a great help if you can do that I'll be seeing you in the next one till then stay awesome bye-bye

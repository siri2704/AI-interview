[Music] sql versus nosql when deciding on a database to purchase application developers must take into account a number of variables there are a variety of commercial databases accessible each with a unique value proposition for the consumer they're classified into two categories sql relational database and nosql non-relational database we will look at the components of each and see how they might help developers what is sql database the structured query language sql often known as sql or sequel is industry standard for working with relational databases structured query language sql is a domain specific computer language used to query and manipulate data in a relational database and sql databases support it the core to a relational data model is to abstract data as a set of tuples grouped into relations which allows for abstraction over actual data representation and access paths sql programming may be used to successfully insert search update and remove database records it is capable of a wide range of tasks including but not limited to database optimization and maintenance sql is a programming language that is used in relational databases such as mysql database oracle ms sql server synbase and others what is nosql a database that is not sql is referred to as not only sql or not sql nosql is a non-relational database management system dms that does not require a set structure eliminates joins and is simple to grow nosql databases are utilized in distributed data repositories with massive storage requirements big data and real-time web apps make advantage of nosql companies such as twitter facebook and google for example gather terabytes tb of user data on a daily basis [Music] advantages and disadvantages of sql sql offers several advantages which makes it popular and in great demand here are some of the advantages of sql advantages faster query processing a large volume of data is rapidly and efficiently obtained insertion deletion and data modification are also performed in near real time no coding knowledge a significant number of lines of code are necessary for data retrieval sql uses all of the fundamental terms such as select insert into update and so on and the syntactical rules are not complicated making it a user-friendly language standardized language as a result of extensive documentation and years of operation it provides a consistent platform for all of its users globally disadvantages sql although sql offers numerous advantages it does have a few disadvantages the following are some of sql's disadvantages complex interface sql has a complex interface that causes some users to feel uneasy when working with the database cost because certain versions are expensive programmers are unable to access them partial control due to hidden business rules the database does not have total control advantages and disadvantages of nosql nosql databases have several advantages and disadvantages over relational databases advantages flexible data models the schemas of nosql databases are generally highly flexible a flexible schema enables you to simply modify your database as your needs evolve horizontal scaling when you surpass the capacity constraints of your existing server most sql databases need you to scale up vertically move to a larger more expensive server disadvantages difficult migration the nosql market is constantly growing however because each database has its own data architecture and query language the lack of standardization is hindering development this makes conversion to a nosql database difficult and impedes unity and maturity no standardized delivering because there are so many distinct types of nosql databases accessible there is no standard for reporting performance statistics each database has a unique data model making uniform reporting challenging to create and execute sql versus nosql [Music] sql is the most appropriate relational database to employ especially when the relationship between data sets is well-defined and easily accessible it is also the best method for determining data integrity sql allows for high-level ad-hoc queries if you need flexible data access and sql databases are usually vertically scalable i.e increase a single server workload by increasing ram cpu ssd etc for large amounts of data or constantly changing data sets nosql is the best database to use it's also beneficial if you have flexible data models or needs that don't fit into the relational paradigm if you need to work with large amounts of unstructured data document databases such as couchdb mongodb and amazon documentdb are a good choice horizontal scalability is a fundamental principle of many nosql data storage in contrast to sql their built-in resources and high availability requirements facilitate horizontal scaling i.e scaling out conclusion most database specialists are responsible for selecting or recommending a database and sql versus nosql is a valuable factor for making informed decisions when evaluating any database it is vital to evaluate key data requirements as well as any acceptable compromises that are beneficial for reaching performance and uptime goals

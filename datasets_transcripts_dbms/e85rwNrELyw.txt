[Music] hello everyone I am adya from Shri venkateswara College of Engineering from Department of CSC today I am going to give you all a presentation on introduction to ER diagram of contents what is an ER diagram and en itty attributes relationship generalization aggregation generalization specialization inheritance ER diagram example what is an ER diagram an ER entity relationship diagram is a visual representation of the structure of a database it consists of three main components entities attributes and relationships these components help to Define and organize the data within the database entity entities are represented by means of rectangles rectangles are named with the entity set they represent attributes attributes are the properties of entities attributes are represented by by means of ellipses every ellipse represents one attribute and is directly connected to its entity rectangle if the attributes are composite they are further divided in a tree like structure every node is then connected to its attribute that is composite attributes are represented by ellipses that are connected with an ellipse multivalued attributes are depicted by double ellipse derived attributes are depicted by dashed ellipse relationship relationships are represented by diamond shaped box name of the relationship is written inside the diamond box all the entities rectangles representing in a relationship are connected to it by a line binary relationship ship and cardinality a relationship where two entities are participating is called a binary relationship cardinality is the number of instance of an entity from a relation that can be associated with the relation one to one when only one instance of an entity is associated with the relationship it is marked as 1 is to one the following image reflects that only one instance of each entity should be associated with the relationship it depicts one to one relationship one to many when more than one instance of an entity is associated with a relationship it is marked as 1 is to n the following image reflects that only one instance of entity on the left and more than one an instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship it depicts one to many relationship many to one when more than one instance of entity is associated with the relationship it is marked as n is to 1 the following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the left and only one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship it depicts many to one relationship many to many the following image reflects that more than one instance of an entity on the left and more than one instance of an entity on the right can be associated with the relationship it depicts many to many relationship participation constraints total participation each entity is involved in the relationship total participation is represented by double lines partial participation not all entities are involved in the relationship partial participation is represented by single lines generalization aggregation the ER model has the power of expressing database entities in a conceptual hierarchial manner as the hierarchy goes up it generalizes the view of entities and as we go deep in thearchy it gives us the detail of every entity included going up in the structure is called generalization where entities are clubbed together to represent a more generalized view for example a particular student name mea can be generalized along with all the students The Entity sh will be student and further the student is the person the reverse is called specialization where a person is a student and that student is Mea generalization the process of generalizing entities where the generalized entities contain the properties of all the generalized entities is called generalization in generalization a number of entities are brought together into one generalized entity based on their similar characteristics for example pigeon house parrow Crow and DOW can all be generalized as Birds specialization specialization is the opposite of generalization in specialization a group of entities is divided into subgroups based on their characteristics take a group person for example a person has name date of birth gender Etc these properties are common in all persons human beings but in a company persons can be identified as employee employer customer or vendor based on what role they play in the company similarly in a school database persons can be specialized as teacher student or or a staff based on what role they play in school as entities inheritance we use all the above features of er model in order to create classes of objects in objectoriented programming the details of entities are generally hidden from the user this process known as abstraction inheritance is an important feature of generalization and specialization it allows lower level entities to inherit the attributes of higher level entities for example the attributes of a person class such as name age and gender can be inherited by lower level entities such as student or teacher ER diagram example suppose you are given the following requirements for a simple database for the National Hockey League NHL the NHL has many teams each each team has a name a city a coach a captain and a set of players each player Belongs to Only One team each player has a name a position such as left wing or goalie a skill level and a set of injury records a team captain is also a player a game is played between two teams referred to as host team and guest team and has a date such as May 11th 1999 and underscore such as 422 construct a clean and concise ER diagram for the NHL database this is an ER diagram for the NHL database question two a university registers office maintains data about the following entities courses including number title credits syllabus and prerequisites course offerings including course number year semester section number instructors timings and classroom students including student ID name and program instructors including identification number name department and title further the enrollment of students in courses and grades awarded to students in each course they are enrolled for much to be appropriately modeled construct an ER diagram for the registers Office document all assumptions that you make about the mapping constraints this is an year diagram for a university regist office thank you so much for watching my presentation if you like my presentation

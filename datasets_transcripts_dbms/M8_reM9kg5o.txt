hello today lecture is about database in uh unit one there is a topic called database basic basic concepts and uh how to create databases and their uses in agriculture so let's get started this is the presentation in terms of nodes and first thing is the database it's basically the collection of a related data data could be anything it could be your name address that is textual data it could be images it could be audio anything and uh the collection of related data some kind of data which is similar in nature it is maintained in the database and uh next thing is what is data is basically the collection of raw facts and figures and uh that have their implicit meaning for example the names the telephone numbers the addresses of peoples is example of data and uh another term is database management system dvms basically it is a collection of programs that enables user to create and maintain a database to so in computers we need to create databases to achieve that task we need some kind of specialized softwares which be called database Management Systems in case of windows it's Ms access and uh there is also another dbms called SQL structured query language or MySQL so these are the specialized software used for creating and maintaining the databases so dbms is just a collection of program which is used to create and maintain the databases and this is the basic example of a database that uh stores student course information and uh generally in databases the relational databases I am talking about the data is stored in form of tables here you can see first table is the student table then the attendance table course table and marks report Table and all these tables stores specific information for example this student table only hold student information like his name RO number and which branch is study in CSC MBA BC Agriculture and uh the course table is dedicated to the subject name and subject codes only what are the subjects and what are the subject codes similarly for the attendance table what is the attendance for the month of March December etc for the that particular student having this particular row number and similarly the marks report which student obtained how much marks for a particular subject and it is maintained in this marks report Table it was basic example all this of simple database which store the student course information we will discuss uh these Concept in detail in later sections so the next concept is the users what are the users persons associated with databases uh generally uh there are administrators designers and end users uh these are the roles given to the persons dealing with the database first is DVA these are the administrators and uh to discuss administrators first let's discuss database designers what are the designers and uh generally these are the experts technical experts or you can see database designers are those people whose task is to design the database for example in case of University uh if the university need some kind of database to hold student online examination record to conduct online examination and uh to store the scores marks scored by the student for various departments and various subjects there need to be some kind of special lized skilled person to design their database so those have expertise in the domain of computers in the domain of databases and those person will Design the database and whenever the database is designed it is handed over to database administrators and these are the persons [Music] who are or the owners I can say owners of the database for example taking the example of uh the automobile industry for example the in case of abas University the buses buses are the main source of commute from University to the student homes or other locations the bus is designed by the designer and uh in that case that could be SAS Mazda a company who designed the that bus particular bus and uh that bus is purchased by the AAS education Society so we can say the a aasi education Society are the administrators who maintain their those buses who decide which person will enter which person can travel via those buses or not who will drive the bus who will operate the bus and proper maintenance how the proper maintenance of that those buses will be conducted so end users end users are the people who use those buses for commute for example difficulty the uh students or other staff members similarly the databases in case of concept of databases the designer create the database the administrators are the persons who responsible for maintaining that database they decide which users can perform what kind of operation on the database they can can they add some kind of data can retrieve certain kind of data what kind of access to every user need to be allocated and end user are the persons who generally use that database and uh what are the advantages of using a database first one is the uh redundancy can be controlled using database what is redundancy redundancy means the uh storing of same data multiple times in multiple location for example in case of computers if I am having a particular song uh stored in multiple folders in my computer or in my smartphone then I can say that a particular song it could be an image is a redundant and for that redundancy cause lot of Storage wastage storage wastage and wastage of other resources so in case of databases that particular redundancy problem can be controlled we will discuss later second is the restricted unauthorized access this is the second advantage of using a database you can decide which person can access what kind of information stored in the database for example and computers if you are having a personal computer there are user accounts and certain user accounts have certain capabilities or privileges like what kind of software up one by one user can install another might not install or what kind of storage partitions hard dis partitions the data stored in them they might access them or might not access them similarly in concept case of of databases we can restrict the unauthorized access someone who's not allowed to access certain parts of data uh might not be able to access if proper uh authorization scheme is maintained here is example of financial data the medical data medical records confidential record any kind of confidential data the next advantage of database is it provide uh storage structures for efficient query processing what does this mean we can ask the database certain kind of questions for example I can ask the database tell me the total number of admissions in BC agriculture for the year 2020 or 2019 or I can ask a question like tell me uh what are the total number number of students which reside in hosts or specific attendance regarding questions like uh how many students having attendance less than 70% for the course BC agriculture year 2020 these are certain kind of quaries which can be executed on the database and database will provide the report regarding the result or responses the next advantage of using a database is the backup and Recovery what does back recovery means uh say in case of personal computer or smartphone I am having a music image any kind of data and uh what if my the smartphone got broken got stolen or the files get accidentally deleted by some kind of a mistake or anything then it might be some challenging task to recover that data similarly in case of databases it provide excellent backup and recovery facility your data could be backed up in different locations online or offline and you can take backups in separate storage Medias Etc and in case of recovery we can recover the data from the last stages next thing is it Advantage is providing multiple user interfaces multiple user interfaces means for there are various roles various persons who are using the database we said earlier there are end users who generally for whom the database is built and uh there are administrator who manage the database who assign the users to perform certain kind of operations on the database for example adding data maintaining records anything or there are designers so for each set of users there need to be a kind of user interface different user interface designer would have different interface which helps or enables them to create maintain modified databases administrator will have different user interface similarly for and users so with the help of dbms is Advantage is for multiple user interface and uh last thing is the uh representing it helps in representing the complex relationships among data okay so here are some points when not to use a database there are certain cases when the overhead cost of using databases are high for example to use the database we need a computer hardware we need a dbms software to purchase we need some training for the administrators for the end users and if all these factors like security recovery and concurrency control all the costs associated with the these are much higher than the use of database might not be recommended and uh second case is the when we might achieve the desirable results using regular files then there is no need for example if I just need to store my I can see mobile number contact number my email address then I can create say this normal file and uh I can store any simple data over here for these kind of simple operations there is no need for the database and uh next thing is the dvms provided by Microsoft it's called Ms access it is the database management system for creating the databases and uh it comes under MS office package this is the relational this is the the relation Microsoft uh jet database Engine with graphical user interface and and uh there this might be in your syllabus as well or might not be this is the this is Ms access creating database preparing queries this is also practical of how to use this MSX but in a n cell let's see this is how it looks like Ms access I just typee this is the dbms and uh I'm using the latest version 2019 here is the option of creating a blank database I just create a blank database and choose the location where I want to store this I want to store the database in the desktop and type his name as students and hit create button so this is the database let's see check the desktop folder and view this is the database which we just created and uh let's go through Theory then one by one we cover the next sections there are lot of concept like this data type what is data type the data type generally determines the kind of value kind of data which can be stored in any given field so what is a field in data bases the basic structure for storing data is called table in form of table this is the simple table it is having rows representing record so this is the record one this is record two this is record three and column these are the columns representing the fils so I just erase those and uh see this is the first field what kind of data I want to store I can for example this thing over here I discussed the field name here is the name it specifies that below the these cells will hold the name of the person and the second field is role number this specify that below B will only accept numbers numeric values for R numbers similarly for branch this is the field and the name of the table is this student field are name RO number Branch similarly in case of attendance the name of the fields are name number branch and there are these two months so back to our data types it determines what kind of values can be stored in any given field so generally for data we are having textual data and for those data which are having characters less than or up to 255 characters there is a data type called sort text and for longer text up to 64,000 characters there is a data type called long text similarly for numbers if you want to store number you have to specify the data type number and to hold date and time to store date and time there is date and time data type and uh currency data type is also there next is this concept tables tables are used to store the data these act as the container for storing data inside the database this is the simple uh template of a table above are the field name and the vertical these rows represent the records and uh to design DET table we need to set the field name these are the field name I am setting here first name last name City semester and type of data the names are generally numeric alpha numeric so s text would be appropriate and the data which I will populate here uh I am setting this value abish uh similarly for last name is data type I'm setting s text and value setting Kumar and let's just create this table in the dbms so to create a table I just hit create button and this is the table and I just give it a name name so I just write uh students info s du u d n students info this is the name of the table I am giving and now I need to specify the is design so you can see here the field name it is asking me those field name these names field one field two field three what I want to store let say I want to store student role number and uh what kind of data type it is role number is generally a number so I choose the number and you can see these are the types of data types we discussed earlier short text long text number date and time currency Etc so for R number I am using data type called number similarly for name and I want to stay this name and uh it's saying the field name you specified name is a reserve word so I cannot type name I have to specify STD name and name of the student you can see maximum characters for S TT are 255 characters these would be enough and uh a third thing which I want to store is the for example code course your semester I can say SD student course C course and this course s Text data type is okay and this interface which you are right now seeing it is the interface provided for the designers right now I am playing a role of a designer I'm designing a database and uh this was the interface graphical user interface I was talking earlier ler P3 database provide so I just create a simple table with the three field role number name course and here you can see this is the key yeah there is a key and uh this key is called primary key for whatever record I set this key that record needs to be unique for example if I set this key to the name and uh for that table I have to maintain the unique names earlier I said about redundancy that means duplicate records are not allowed to be uh entered inside databases to to control that redundancy we control it with the help of a primary keys and if I set any filled a primary key that record needs to be different for example in any class if I set primary key to name no two student can have same name as abishek or AJ anything so generally primary Keys set to Unique record like role number two student can have same name but two student cannot have the same role number so I can say role number is the uniquely identifying fi name and uh it's good to set it as a primary key so here we just set the all the fills all the data type let's just save it and close it and on the this side preview panel we can see we are having inside table section uh there is this table students info table and uh talking about the interface this is the graphical user interface of Ms access on the top there is is the title bar stating the location of the students database where it is stored its name and uh on the right hand corner there are close maximize and minimize button and this is file menu home menu create external data these are all standard toolbar icons and this gray area over here is the workspace this left side is the preview pen or I can say access objects all the objects like tables reports queries would be shown here and in the bottom this is the uh status bar saying what kind of a responses we are getting so here I just create a table I double click the table to open it and you can see all the fields RO number name course get automatically seted and uh to fill the data inside this table I need to design a form and without that just go to back to theories and this is the next concept called forms so what is a form uh form is a medium through which be populate DET table with the data generally forms you might have fill the examination form the form you use for log to social networking sites any kind of sites online generally these are called form but the form these have these labels which tells what kind of information you are required to input in these text boxes and generally have the submit send okay buttons so these forms with the help of the these forms we can fill the data inside those tables and uh let's see how to create a form I am having this table and right now I need to create a form just I I just go to create a and click form and uh it just automatically created the form but uh there is another way and uh this is the create tab I just once again goes back to create Tab and here is a option called form Wizard and this is the more robust way of Designing form and on this dropdown showing list of tables I am just having one table called student info and these are the field RO number name and course so I want all three to be add it in my form and click next and it's a talking about the layout what kind of layout I want I just set to default and what kind of name I want to give I just want to give it name form students info and just hit finish and you can see over here the form gets created and uh let's just type some value r for r number I'm typing roll number 55 name my name and course is btech CSC enough and to store this record this on the bottom this you can see there are these buttons triangular buttons I just click click this triangle next record button and you can see all the data get saved I can check the table by double clicking and this is the value I just filled the data gets stored so I just close all once again open the form and it's showing the records I want to add another record so I just click next record and I type another name here RO number 37 and uh is name I type maper and this scores as well btech CSC for another student I just type his name SD 3 and okay RO number I need to be type numeric values only 86 is name student 3 and is course BC agre culture I just hit this next record button and all records are saved just close the form and see the data inside tables you can see all the data got stored in this table called student info of the database students so next concept theoretically is the query this is the New Concept what is query it is generally a request for to the database to access certain kind of uh results or generally you are asking a database to provide some kind of information it could be a simple question or a complex question there are various queries to retrieve the data to delete the data to modify the data to add the data and uh for this practical purpose I am just using some basic query to retrieve the data let's see how to create queries I just save this thing and I need to create a query I just go to create T and here is a query wizard type what I need I need a simple query okay uh but I want I want to only the role number and the name I want all the students name and role number of the student info table so I just click next give it name query simple and finish you can see this initially this is the table it is having three students and uh is fils are R number name and course but I just create a query and I ask give me tell me just R numbers and name of all the students and uh I can also modify the query [Music] to ask the database like tell me only those list of only those student stent whose role number is below 50 below 60 so to do that I can just modify it using this design view and uh criteria I can specify any specify criteria only RO number I Tye greater than 50 you can see now actually the records are 37 7 55 and 86 and here it's showing only those students whose role number are greater than 50 I just remodify the query in design view I just type show me only those student whose uh RO number is less than 50 and let's see only Meer is having role number 37 is shown here so these are the simple queries and use for retrieving some specific record updating a record deleting a record modifying the records and next thing is the report this is the report and uh what are the reports generally report offer a bay to summarize the information in access database or generally there are some kind of reports for example I can ask the database tell me list of all those students whose attendance is below 75% so this is the general query which I want this result and uh the result which the database provide can be converted into reports which can further be exported to PDF documents and for example here in this case what I create I just create another another table or this table I add some more data some more data I need to fill so I just go back to here and I type RO number 22 I type it name as student 4 and it course BSC Agriculture and let's type RO number five this name is student five course is B MBA let's type student number 15 and name is student 4 student 88 is courses BSC Agriculture and hit save button and now what I just I just refresh and you can see lot of of records are here and total there are six students here and if I see the result of this query it is showing me this thing simple query I go to this design view and I want only those students whose RO number is less than 30 so I just specify the criteria whose role number is less than 30 only show me those student and only three student are here so I want this thing this query result as to be report of my results so I just create go to create T and and uh report Wizard and here is the it is specifying what you want to from where you want to create the report I want to create the report from this query and put all the fields next the default I set it default all default and give it a name called report list of students whose role number are below 30 and this is the report right now list of students whose role number are below 30 on the left hand side are the role number and on the right hand side these are the names and you can see below the date Dam stamp on which the report is generated and page number I can also modify it by going to design view and this is the how it looks in the design view and for this title I can change the color go to to format and I want this color to be this blue some bold and I want to increase it size further and this is the header field firstage R number I just set to bold and set this color to Green and similarly bold and green the font size I set to 22 and this two 22 let's see in the print preview okay so I need some more modifications I go to design view and I just specify the height of the field some more and this thing I need to provide some spacing okay and I go back to print preview and you can see I have up some text formatting here is the list of student so number r and some more tweak I need to do are below I need to increas this size go back to print preview list of students whose R number are below 30 and this is the report similar report I can ask for the database give me list of all the students who are from Sund nagar or who belongs to this particular location or who are hostler or who are this caller anything anything and this is the report and one more thing I want to tell you can export these reports directly to PDF document so to export this report I just right click it and here is the export option what kind of format I want to export I just select PDF portable document file and where I want to export in the desktop I just hit publish and you can see this is my desktop and it is the this is the report generated and here it is list of students so number are below 30 and this is the temp stem this is the page number and list you can this mail this file and share this file with others back to our notes so these were the reports next thing is the relationship and uh what is this thing is generally as I said earlier the data inside the databas is stored using these tables and these tables might be linked together with the help of concept called relationship for example uh in this course table it is storing the course subject course code and subject name and I can infer from this table that the students which are stored in this student table all these courses belong to these students similarly attendance which this table is storing this attendance belongs to these students similarly and for the report card all the marks scored by the in the various subject by these students belong to these students so how do I link this table to these three tables I want to link the student table with the course marks and attendance table to accomplish this I need to go through the Rel relationships so what are the relationships these are used to join the tables and further they helps to remove the redundancy and uh there are created with the help of this primary key but are the primary key these Keys help to uniquely identify a particular record and if you set a primary key to any field it cannot have the two record with the same values there is another concept called foreign key and for a particular table there might be there will be maximum of one primary key and uh if you want to set the name as well as a primary key you cannot do you can either have row number or name as a primary key and uh so what is this foreign key for example I am having this table and in the second table the primary key is AAR card number and uh I am using role number which is the primary key of this table one so I can see the RO number is the foreign key and primary key is the AAR number so primary key of another table we call it as a foreign key there are three kind of relationship one to one one to many and many to many and and uh in one to one relationship let's see B relate one record from one table to only one record of another table say in this case I am having two tables first table is student personal information and second table is student academic report I want to say uh to the database see databas the RO number of this table is related to RO number of this table so these two RO number belongs to same person and I want to link these two tables using this primary key which is RO number and uh say for example if I specify here RO number two and uh for the RO number two I can specify the marks scored in computer English and math and all those marks will be uh linked with ro number two only similarly for number seven I can specify different scored marks and so on another relationship is one too many and in this case only one student can have only one RO number so one to one relationship was okay but in case of uh this thing here uh the here are two tables project table and task table and uh one student one student can have many projects so in this case one to many relationship is appropriate or I can say one student can there could be library and uh many books could be issued to one students to relationship would be one to many and there is another many to many relationship and here are Junction table this is the junction table it is created and here one to many and many to one relationship are formed which ultimately construct the many to many relationship so these are the three relationships which are used to link the tables and enforce the data redundancy and concurrency so let's see how to create a relationships so I just hit save to for creating the relationship we need to have more tables and you can see here I just have one table here so let's just create another table I go to create table and give it a name in the design view I set this name to student attendance and I want to set RO number as the primary key and here is the attendance filled and I set it to number okay and I just hit the save button and this is the data set View and in this case I am having the student info table what I do I just delete all the data because the relationships are created earlier in when we are designing the database so I need to make sure the both the tables are empty and here I go to this database tools and here are the relationships this one and I just add first student info table and student attendance table these are two tables this one and this one and now I want to link student info I want to tell that the these two tables storing the same record for the students and I just drag and drop and create one two one relationship and it is saying that the tables are open I first need to close the tables before linking them together so I just create here the relationship one 2 1 you can see over the line one and one so if this the relationship is constructed whenever I just input the data in one table it automatically get related to uh store to another table for asking me to save the table I just save and I just create another form to fill the data see I just create another form using form bizard and from the student info table I want to add R number name course and then from the attendance table I just pick the attendance next and finish and it is asking me R number one this name is I say and it course is BC Agri culture and it attendance is 70% next is sd2 student 2 okay this RO number is 22 sd2 and this course is BC agriculture attendance 88% next is student three okay and this RO number it is asking 33 76% next is student 4 oh is RO number 44 this course BC gulture attendance 88% and another last student student five it's Ro number I set to 55 student 5 course BC agriculture under attendance 40% okay so let's see here is the attendance table you can see after linking those two tables the data is also stored and this is also stored is number I say 10 and in the info table is value is also change to 10 close all okay from here I can create another queries and reports for the student having attendance below this value or above this value and and that's all this was about uh the database it's concept basic concepts and uh it was a long lecture and we have just covered the unit one concept of database you can get all the notes from the website just go to www. alex21 c.com SL noes and and over here there is a section of BSC Agriculture and here is your subject agriculture informatics I just open it and uh here inside this lectures folders you go to unit one unit 2 unit 3 anything and uh these are the topics this database concept and and you will find the PDF documents of notes or presentations over here you can download these and uh study later on if you have any questions let me know and that's all

so today today I am going to teach you structured query language the structured query language so what is a structured query language it is a language which is used to manage data whenever you are trying to manage data add data delete data okay modify data update data whenever you are trying to perform these kinds of operations in that case you will need this language here that is called structured query language SQL okay so this is the SQL which I am going to teach you now uh what is the SQL SQL is a single line command language SQL is a single line command language because in SQL majority of commands that you are going to run are in single line you will have a very single line you can run that single line and your command will be executed and your command will be executed here okay so I'm am going to teach you this SQL here structured query language okay and with the help of this language SQL we are going to construct our database we are going to construct our database okay so first of all uh first of all let's talk about what is actually a database first of let's talk about what is actually a database see a database is a collection of tables different different tables what is a database database is a collection of your different different kinds of tables here which can have different different kinds of columns different different kinds of rows and where you are trying to store your data that is called a database that is called a database here that it is a collection of tables database is a collection of your different different tables here in which you are trying to store your different different kind of data so I am going to run one database by the name of LMS I am going to build up one database by the name of LMS so my database name will be LMS my database name will be LMS LMS stands for Library management system LMS stands for Library management system so I'm going to make one database by the name of LMS now this LMS database will have and now this LMS database will have will have four tables this LMS database will have four tables here my first table will be books table where I am going to store the data of books okay my second table will be users table where I'm going to store the data of my users for login data for login form okay my third table will be admin data where I'm going to store the data of librarian the librarian who will manage the books The Librarian who will manage the library that is called admin here so I will have one admin table and I will have one issue table these are the four tables I'm going to build in my database inside my database LMS I am going to build up these four tables here books user admin uh and issue you can say books users admins and issue these are the four tables I am going to build up here now in books table I will have three columns in books table I will have three columns so book ID book name and author name book ID book name and author name these are the three uh these are the three I will have available in my books table okay then let's talk about users table so in users table I will have two columns user ID and user password user ID and user password these are the two columns which will be available here so let me write PWD user password okay these are the two columns which will be available in my users table in my admin table I will have two columns admin ID and admin password so that they can login so that they can login in my uh system here so that they can login in my project so admin ID and admin password these these two columns will be available in this uh admin table and in issue table in issue table I am going to store the data of issue the books which are being issued by the student the books which are being issued by the users I am going to store their data as well so I will have issue ID I will have issue ID I will have I will have issue ID I will have um book ID the book which has been issued the book which was being issued here book ID and then I will have user ID and then I will have user ID as well user ID as well that which user has issued which book which user has is issued which book that is the information which will be given by these book ID and user ID okay so that is how I will be able to store the DAT of issue as well the books which are being issued the books which are being issued by different different users here I will be able to store those data as well so this is the structure of my database this is the structure of my database that my database name will be LMS it will have four tables books users admins issue okay and every table will have these columns here every table will have these columns here that is what will be available here okay that is what will be available here okay so this is what you can see here now in each of these columns in each of these columns in each of these columns uh in each of these columns uh we need one column which can uniquely identify the row in every table see in every table you want to uniquely identify your rows it is very important to uniquely identify the rows and how we can do that if you want to uniquely identify the rows in your table you can make one column as a primary key what you can do out of all of those your columns you can make one column as a primary key so for example I can make book ID as a primary key here okay in the users table I can make user ID as a primary key what is a primary key Prim key is simply any column which is very helpful for uniquely identifying any row uh from the table let me give you an example let me give you an example so for example let's say you are a student so for example let's say you are a student so all the data of your students will be stored somewhere all the data of you students of all of you students of all of you students all the data of you students will be stored in some student database now if I want to uniquely identify each and every student now if I want to uniquely identify each and every student so how can I do that role number with the help of role number so role number is a kind of a primary key RO number is a kind of a primary key which is uniquely used to which is used to uniquely identify each and every instrument each and every particular instrument Adar number Adar number is also a primary key other number is also a primary key which is used to uniquely identify your rows from the data okay so that is also what is possible here that you can have these columns and these columns can have one primary key okay so this is what is possible here this is what you can do in your database okay so this is what is possible here that is how I am going to make these columns as primary key I am going to make these columns as primary key so whenever you want to uniquely identify an entry whenever you want to uniquely identify one entry from your table one row from your table then you can do that with the help of primary key then you can do that with the help of primary key that is the structure of my database this is the structure of my database I am going to create okay and here you can search MySQL download here you can search MySQL download okay then you will come to this page MySQL installer 8.0.3 4 okay so this is what is possible here uh this is the page here okay so let me show you one more time on the Google you can search MySQL download then click on the second link click on the second link MySQL installer 8.0.3 4 this is the latest version of MySQL this is the latest version of MySQL okay then you will come to this page as soon as you will come to this page you can click on this uh this below button you can come to this below button there are two buttons are available two buttons are available click on the below button click on the below button and you can start downloading the setup in your computer no thanks just start my download no thanks just start my download and it will start downloading the setup in your computer see as you can see in my computer as you can see in my computer it is downloading the setup in my computer okay so I'm downloading the latest version of 8.0.3 into my my SQL okay make sure to click on the lower button and then this setup will be able to download here okay so that is what is possible here that is how that is how you will be able to uh download the setup here okay so let the setup get downloaded and as soon as the setup will download we will open the setup and we will install MySQL in our computer okay so installation of MySQL is very important installation of MySQL is very important that is how you are going to do it okay so let this get installed okay so this setup has been downloaded in my computer the setup has been downloaded in my computer now you can open the setup now you can open the setup so so it is opening the setup here okay so it is opening the setup here now when it will try to open the setup now now when it will try to open the setup uh it will take a little bit of uh time here okay but uh it will open the setup for you in uh and it will ask you for some permission here you may not be able to see the permission on screen you may not be able to see the permission on screen but it will ask some kind of permission here do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device something like that my will installer Community 8.0.3 4 yes click on the yes if you will see something like that then click on yes button okay and uh then it will ask you for one more permission then it will ask for one more permission MySQL installer launcher.exe then it will ask for one more permission launcher.exe again click on Yes again click on yes and it will open the my SQL installer in your computer see it is is opening the MySQL installer in my computer so some screen like this will appear okay when you will open MySQL installer in your computer uh this kind of screen will available in your computer okay now uh now what will happen here that you have to download uh some things here that you can use here okay you have to download some things that you can use here so you can click on so from here a lot of options are available a lot of options are available so from here you can select the third option please select the third option full option there are lot of options are available you can select the third option full option and then you can click on next button and it will in start installing all these things in your computer then it will start installing all of these things in your computer okay then click on next button and it will ask you that whether you want to install all these things click on execute button click on execute button and it will start installing all these things in your computer so now as you can see here see all the products are successfully completed all the successfully completed now you can click on next button and now you can configure your MySQL what is the meaning of configuration configuration means you have to set up your password you have to set up your server here those things you have to do so click on next button okay then you will come to this page type and networking nothing you have to change there is nothing you have to change here click on next button and you will come to this page authentication method nothing you have to change click on next button and here you can take the password from your for your MySQL here for your MySQL you can take the password so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 okay that is what you can do here the same you can do for this one as well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 you can take any password you can take any password for your uh MySQL but please remember that you have a password that you can remember okay make sure that you take a password which you can always remember because that is further will be used okay then you click on next button and uh click on next again server file permission click on next button nothing you have to change and click on execute button now click on execute button and it will start executing these things in your computer and it will start installing these things in your computer okay so that is what will happen here this is what you will be able to uh do now you can click on finish button so this will be completed now click on next button again product configuration again click on finish button so it will be finished again again product configuration next and uh now you can connect to your server so WR type the same password remember your username your username is root your username is root and you have to write your password so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so I will take write the password and if connection succeeded if you can see something like this connection succeeded that means your server is completed here now you can click on next button and execute this configuration as well execute this configuration as well and it will start and it will complete this step as now you can click on finish button and click on next again and the installation has been complete see as you can see here now the installation has been complete in your computer now you can click on finish button now you can click on finish button and uh you and as soon as you will click on finish Button as soon as you will click on finish button uh this shell will open in your computer and this MySQL workbench will open in your computer okay these two things will open in your computer these two things will open in the computer my SQL shell and MySQL workbench now we do not need shell now we do not need shell so I'm closing the shell I am closing the shell because I do not need the shell but but workbench is important for you workbench is important for you because this is the place where you are going to work on your data this is the place where you are going to work on your data as you can see here your my SQ connections are written here as you can see your SQL connections are written here so you see this is your connection this is the connection which is running in the back end of your computer this is the connection which is running in the back end of your computer you can click on this one and here you can write your password to connect with your MySQL server if you want to connect with your MySQL server there are many ways to connect with your MySQL server there are many ways to connect with your MySQL server Excel is available python is available powerbi is available this workbench is available okay a lot of tools are available which you can use whenever you want to connect with your MySQL server why because MySQL server will have all of your data because MySQL will have all of your data so you can write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 your password you have to write your password here and click on okay button first time when you will connect with the server so you will see something like this screen okay so what you can do here is that first of all uh first of all uh first of all what you can do first of all you can remove this window what is the first thing you can do you can remove this window because this window do not need we do not need this window in our MySQL workbench so what I will do click on this view button click on this view button and click on this panels and hide secondary sidebar hide secondary sidebar so this window will be disappear from your in your screen that window will disappear from your screen and this window will appear in the whole screen this window will appear in the whole screen now this is the place where you are going to write your SQL commands this is the place where you are going to write your SQL commands and with the help of your SQL commands you will be able to manage your data and with the help of SQL commands you will be able to manage your data so for example this is my SQL command for example this is my SQL command I wanted to execute this SQL command if I wanted to execute this SQL command then first of all highlight your command whatever command you want to execute whatever command you want to execute highlight the command and click on this button click on this electricity icon okay okay so whenever you want to okay so whenever you want to uh connect uh run your SQL command what you can do you can select your SQL command like this and click on this electricity icon so your SQL command will be executed so your SQL command will be executed that is what will happen here okay so this is your playground area this is your area where you are going to write your SQL commands and you are going to manage your data now uh please see where is my cursor this here is my cursor see as you can see here here is my cursor click on this schemas button click on this schemas button click on this schemas button so when you will click on this schemas button see this is my icon Okay click on the schemas button so you will be able to see all the schemas on your database you will sorry you will be able to see all the schemas on your server schemas means your databases SCH schemas means SCH schema means your databases so all of your databases will be available here okay all of your databases will be available here that is what will happen so this is what you will be able to see here that three default databases are available as you can see three default databases are available here that is what you can do here so this is what is possible here this is what is possible here that is what that is what you will be able to do here that is what you will be able to do here that is what you can use okay and uh and this is what you can do and then what you can do uh you can click on this uh okay so here you will be able to see all of your database then you will be able to work on your data okay now after running your SQL command after running your SQL command you will be able to see the output in this lowest area in this lower section see in this lower section in this lower window in this lower window you will be able to see your outcome you will be able to see your output okay whatever is your output whatever is your output you will be able to see your output here okay whatever is your output you will be able to see your output here that is what is possible here okay this is what is possible here that is how that is how you will be able to work on your database here okay so this is what is possible here that is what you will be able to do as well okay you will be able to see the outcome here that whether your SQL command is successfully executed or it is not or it is not successfully executed okay so that is also possible here now what you can do you can save your SQL commands here what you can do just like you save your Python program just like you save your Python program you can click on this save button you can click on the save button and you can save your SQL file somewhere so for example let's say I want to save my file by the name of project this is a SQL file see you are trying to save a SQL file you are trying to save a SQL file so SQL file will be saved by the name of project okay by the name of project your SQL file will be saved here that is something you can do as well that is something that is something you can do on your project as well okay on your SQL as well okay so you can save your file as well you can save your SQL commands you can save your SQL file as well uh this is also possible here this is also something that you will be able to do on your uh pro project here okay so when we will develop our project when we will develop our project when we will construct the database when we will develop the project and when we will construct the database uh then what we will be able to do then we will be able to work in this area then we will be able to work in this area Okay so this is what we is possible here you will be able to work in this area Okay uh now a lot of options are available here but these options which I taught you are the most important one okay so that is what you can do here and you can work on them okay and you can use them according to your requirs okay so this is possible here this is called your workbench this is called your workbench workbench is the most common tool for beginners for beginners for beginners whenever you want to work on your SQL database then you can use this workbench here okay but other tools are also available if you search MySQL here if you search MySQL here other kinds of tools are also available for example MySQL command line client is available MySQL command line Cent is available here you can write your password so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and you will be able to connect with your database and here you can write your SQL commands here you can write your SQL commands and you will be able to see your data here you will be able to here you will be able to write your SQL commands and you will be able to see your data so that the same thing you can do here as well the same thing you can do here as well and you will be able to run SQL commands here as well but this is not the proper way for running the SQL command so we are going to use workbench here so this workbench this workbench is the most proper place where you are going to run your mysq here okay so that is also possible here this is also possible here uh this is something uh this is something that you can do on your project as well okay uh now let me show you some other things as well go to your search bar go to the search bar and type run go to the search bar and type run here and you will be able to open this run block here okay now here you can write services. Ms msse here you can write services.msc and you can click okay here so why we are doing this thing we are doing this thing so that we can find our MySQL see all the services which are running in your computer all the services which are running in the background of your computer you will be able to see those services so all those services will be available here so many times many times what happen that your service gets stuck many times what happen your service get stuck so you can check your service from here if you want that this is not compulsory for you this is not compulsory for you this is not compulsory for you but what you can do if your MySQL is not working properly you can come back here and you can restart the service you can stop the service you can pause the service these are the operations you can perform on your uh server this is your server here this is the server which running in the back background of your computer and you can use this one for working on your uh project okay so that is optional here this part is optional this part is optional here this part is optional here uh this is something that you can do on your uh project as well whenever you are trying to work here okay okay so this is what is possible here uh this is how you can this is how you can uh work on your workbench here okay so what I can do here is that first of all let me teach you how can you create a database the the first and foremost step for you the first step for you is to create a database how can you create a database see whenever you want to create a database use create keyword then database keyword create keyword database keyword cre keyword database keyword then the name of your database by whatever name you want to create a database by whatever name you want to create a database that is how you can create a database okay whenever you want to create a database in your dbms in your database management system this is my database management system here I want to create my database already three databases are available already three database are available sakila sis World these three databases are also available but you can create your own database you can create your own database and inside that database you can store your data with the help of this command create keyword database keyword then the name of your database then the name of your database so I want to create a database by the name of LMS I want to create a database by the name of LMS so how can I do that create keyword as I told you as I told you create keyword database keyword the keyword database keyword then the name of my database so the name of my database is LMS the name of my database is LMS semicolon is very important semicolon after every line after every line sem colon is very important so you can write semicolon okay and your command is completed this is my command as you can see here this is my command to create a database by the name of LMS how can I run the command select your command highlight your command and click on this electricity icon highlight your command and click on this electricity icon and you will be able to see a green tick here you will be able to see a green Tech here if you can see Green Tech in the output section see in the in the down in the down section you can see here a green Teck green Teck means your command has been successfully executed green deck means your command has been successfully executed okay so now your LMS database has been created but I cannot see it here as you can see I cannot see the LMS database why because you have to refresh your database click on this small Button as you can please see my cursor please see my cursor you can click on this small refresh button and you will be able to refresh your data database management system and you will be able to watch a new database see a new database has been created a new database has been created and inside this database you can work you can work inside the database now let's try to run this command one more time try to run this command one more time but this time it will show the error but this time it will show the error why as you can see Red Cross is given here see Red Cross is given here that that means the command is not successfully executed why because you cannot create a database which already exist see it is telling you the answer as well it is telling you why it cannot create it can't create database LMS database exist because database already exist because database because database already exist you cannot create another database because database already exists you cannot create another database that is something you cannot do okay so this is what is possible here uh this is what you will be able to do that is how you can create a database now after creating the database let's say you want to delete a database delete a database now let's say you want to delete a database so how can you delete a database drop keyword database keyword you can write the drop keyword database keyword then the name of your database then the name of your database and that is how you can drop any database that is how you can drop any database here with with the help of this command drop keyword database keyword database name drop keyword database keyword database name that is how you can drop any database so what can I do I can go to next line and I can write drop keyword database keyword then LMS so drop database LMS highlight this command highlight this command and you can run this command and see your database is removed from the left hand side section see from the left hand side section now now your database has been removed that is how you can remove a database that is how you can remove a database this is also possible now since your database has been removed can you create it again now since your database has been removed you can create it again as well again highlight the First Command again highlight the First Command and click on electricity icon so again your database will be created here again your database will be created here that is how you can create a new database okay so this is possible here that is how you can create a database and that is how you can delete a dat database okay so this is what is possible here that is how you can uh create a database and you can delete a database now let's say you want to work inside a database if you want to work inside a database you have to select a database a database should be selected a database a database should be selected if you want to work on the database if you want to work on the database the database should be selected so how can you do that use keyword then database name keyw database name see your database management system can have many many databases your database management system can have many many databases and you want to work on a certain kind of database and you want to work on a certain kind of database and that is why this third command is very important many times whenever uh let's say you have work on a uh your program okay let's say you have work on the project and after working on the project let's say you close your MySQL workbench you you shut down your computer and next day and next day you open your computer again and you are trying to run the commands here what what is the common mistake people make the common mistake people make that they directly start to run their commands if it if they trying to add a row if they are trying to delete a row they directly try to run that command no it will never run why it will never run because your database is never selected whenever you close your computer and you open it again later on then your database is not selected anymore then your database is not selected any anymore so every time you are trying to work on your database the what is the very first operation whenever you are trying to work on your already existed database if you are trying to work on your already existed database what is the First Command the first command is to select the database unless you are selecting your database you will not be able to run the remaining commands here so what can I do here use LMS this command is very very important this command is very very important many people make mistake here many people make mistake here that they do not run this this command every time you have to run this command every time you have to run this command every time whenever you are trying to work on your already existed database so run this command now your database is selected now now your database is selected here okay now your database is selected so now you can work inside the database now you can work inside the database okay so this is possible here or this is what you can do on your database as well so that is how you can select a database that is how you can select a database that is also possible as so create database delete a database select a database now after selecting the database what else you can do now you can create a table inside a database create a table inside a database so now you want to create a inside database so how can you do that uh create keyword table keyword create keyword table table keyword then the name of your table create keyword table keyword then the name of your table create table table name okay round brackets open round brackets Clos now whenever you are trying to create a table whenever you are trying to create a table it is very important to uh it is very important to define the columns as well whenever you are trying to create table it is very important to define the columns along with it along with it it is very important to define the columns so round brackets inside the wrong brackets you can Write Your First Column name so let's say column name one okay then you can write the data type of your column then you can write the data type of a column integer character what kind of column you are trying to store so column name data type then you can write the size of your data as well so that how much size you want to give to your data okay that is something you can write as well again one more column so column name so column name two uh data type and let's say size and you can do that as long as as you want okay so you can have as many columns as you want you can have as many columns as you want in the end you can have one primary key parameter and inside this par primary key parameter you can write the name of that column which you want to make as a primary key which you want to make as a primary key that is something you can do here that is something you can do here so this is what is possible here okay and uh that is how you will be able to that is how you will be able to work on this work on this one as well okay so this is also possible so this is what you can do as well this is your command for creating a table this is your command for creating a table create keyword table keyword the name of your table First Column name it's data type it size second column name is data type it size thir column name is data types it size and and and so on and so on you can have as many columns as you want and then in the end you can make one column as a primary key and inside the bracket you can write the name of the column which you want as a primary key so for example so for example I want to create this books table so for example I want to create this books table so for this books table I will have three columns here book ID book name and author name I will have these three columns here book ID book name and author name and I want book ID as my primary okay remember this thing remember this thing I want one table by the name of books which will have three columns book ID book name and author name and book ID will be my primary key so what can I do here what can I do here is that I can write create keyword table keyword name of my table is books and inside this you can write the column name so column name is bookor ID book underscore name and author uncore name these are my three columns see these these are my three columns here book ID book name author name now for each and every column for each and every column you can have a data type and you can have the size here now I am going to store all of my data into string I am going to store all of my data into string and for that I'm going to use Vare here so what is Vare Vare is your variable character Vare is your variable character here that you are trying to store your Vare data okay so variable character string data whenever you are trying to store your string data that is what you can take your bar now what is 2 55 2 255 is memory size 255 is the size of the memory that how much memory you you are trying to give here so 255 stands for 0 to 255 255 stands for 0 to 255 that means 256 okay which is 8 bit that is considered as eight 8 bit if you want to store eight bits of data if you want to store in 8 Bits of data so you can store it into this 255 size here that is the meaning of 255 you do not have to go in great details here you do not have to go in great details in order to understand this 255 simply remember simply remember 255 stands for the size of the memory simply remember 255 stands for the size of the memory in which you are trying to store your data the same goes for book name as well so for this one as well Vare 255 and the same one for author name as well so Vare 255 okay so this is what is possible here that is what you can do here that is what you can do here now in the end you can have last column by the name of primary key you can have a last column by the name of primary key okay so this is what is possible here and inside this primary key column inside this primary key column you can write the name of that column which you want as a primary key so I want book ID as my primary key what I want I want book ID as my primary key okay so I can write book underscore ID here inside the primary key function I can write the book ID okay so I can select this command you can select this command and you can done this command so a table will be created by the name of books a table will be created by the name of books here you can refresh your database and here inside the table section inside the table section you will be able to see one table by the name of books you can see the information see in this uh uh in this uh left down section in this left down section you can see here The Columns of your table book ID which is a primary key book name author name okay you can see the information of your table here okay so that is what is possible here that is how you can create a table that is how you can create a table now after creating a table now after creating a table you can now insert values inside your table so insert rows into the table insert rows into the table okay that is something you can do here insert rows into the table okay so how can you insert rows into the table so for that insert keyword into keyword the name of your table table name insert keyword into keyword insert word into world and uh table name after table name you can have values keyword and after values keyword you can have once again a round bracket just like you have a round bracket here the same round bracket you can have here as well and inside this round bracket inside this round bracket you can pass your values so inside this round bracket what can I do I can pass the value for column name one I can pass the value for column name to and so on and so on for every column name for every column name Accord in the same order in the same order in which I have defined the column the same order in which I have defined the column is the same way I can write the values here in the same way I can write the values here so column one value comma column two value and so on okay uh that is what is possible here that is what you will be able to do here and you will be able to use it okay so this is what is possible here that is how you can insert rows that is how you can insert rows into your table if you want to insert rows into your table this is the command that you can execute here okay so let's try to execute this command let's try to insert some dummy data let's try to insert some data into our books table so insert into books table name is books Valu and here you can write the uh and here you can write the values here okay so what are the values here values are book ID book name and author name so book ID can be any value for book ID so for example let's say b001 let's say my book ID is b001 then we have book name so what can be the book name the book name can be maybe let's say Let's Learn Python any book name you can have any book name here so let's say Let's Learn Python yeah that is the name of the book then author name author name is let's say Arun author name is author name is let's say Aron okay so that is what you can do here that is how you can have one row see this is my one row inside my table this is my one row inside my table here that is what you can do here okay so I have three columns as you can see here I have three columns in my table so according to those three columns I have passed the value B 001 for book ID Let's Learn Python for book name and Aron for author name in the same order in the same order I have passed the value so you can select this command and you can run this one and uh your row has will be inserted in your table your row will be inserted into the table okay that is something possible here now let's say you want to add one more data so b002 let's say some other kind of data let's say introduction to AWS and let's say book name is MAA author name is Mea okay so you can run this command and another row will be added another row will be added in your data okay so you will be able to add entries these are called entries these are called entries entries means rows entries means rows you are trying to add rows in your data you are trying to add some entries in your data okay so that is what is possible here this is how you can add new rows in your data as well and then you can work on it then you can uh retrieve the data as well so if you want to retrieve the data if you want to get the data okay so to to retrieve the table data excuse me to retrieve the table data okay so if you are trying to retrieve the table data what you can do here you can run select command select estri from table name select s from table name that is your command this is the command which is available in front of you select asct table name select ASC table name this is the command which is available for you you can run this command you can run this command and you will be able to have your data here okay you will be able to have your data here then you will be able to work on the data then you will be able to work on the data that is what is possible here so select s from table name okay so that is what I can do here so for example let's say select s from table name you can see you can retrieve all the data you can retrieve all the data from your table so select keyword T keyword from keyword table name table name is books this is your command here this is your command here you can select this command you can select this command and run this command and see your data has is available in the output screen see this is your another output screen this is another output screen and in this output screen you can see your data see book ID book name author name these are your three column these are three columns and you have two rows here B 001 Let's Learn Python Aron b002 introduction to AWS mea that is how you are trying to add your data see your data has been added into your database that is how you are able to add some data into your database here you are able to organize your data into the tables here and you are able to add the data okay so this is what is possible here that is how row by row that is how row by row you can add M data and you can work on the data so B 003 let's say Ango for professionals okay and let's say and let's say uh Manish let's say Manish okay so let me run this command you can run this command and now you will have three rows now you will have three rows here so run this command so now you will have three rows here okay but let me tell you one more thing let me tell you one more thing book ID is a primary key book ID is a primary key it should never be repeated again so let's say if I try to add this same data one more time maybe let's say by another name maybe let's say by another name here let's say maybe let's say by another name here data science data science with python okay so for example if let's say this is my another book and I uh wanted it here so for example let's say uh for example let's say utar something like utar okay and let me run this command so this will not work this will show the error why why it will show the error because primary key is same see primary key cannot be same everything can be same everything in your table can be same everything in your table can be same but primary key cannot be same duplicate entry P 003 for key books primary for the primary key we have a duplicate entry for the primary key we have a duplicate entry and that is why you are not able to add this row that is why you are not able to add this row so remember this thing okay so this is what is possible here that is what you can do here and uh and that is what you can do here and uh okay so this is possible here this is possible here that is how uh you can work on your data and you can show your data okay you can show your data like this you can show your data like this now what else can you do after retrieving your data you can do after retrieving your data let's say you want want to uh let's say let's say you want to update Arrow let's say you want to update Arrow so to update Arrow so if you are trying to update Arrow you can update arrow in your table as well you can update a row in your table as well so to update a row for example let's say there is a particular value in your row that you are trying to update so what you can do update update table name update table name okay set keyword then the column name the column name in which you want to update the column name in which you want to update column name equals to new value column name equals to new value whatever is the new value that you are trying to pass here column name equals to new value where where keyword okay so update keyword table name uh set keyword column name equals to new value where where uh where uh where uh where row name so row name is also very important row name equals to primary key row name equals to primary key value so you can write the primary key value here and you will be able to update a row you will be able to update a row let me show you one example let me show you one example here so this is your books table okay this is your books table in front of you so for example let's say I want to uh so for example if I wanted to update it so for for example let's say introduction to AWS to uh let's say uh let's say uh aure for beginners I want to change the name I wanted to change here so for example let's run python to let's run Java I wanted to update the value I wanted to update the value from Let's Learn Python to let's learn Java so how can I do it here how can I do that here so first of all you have to remember the row you have to remember the row and you have to remember the column you have to remember the row and you have to remember the column so in the column what value you want to change so book name value you want to change so you can write here update books set update books set um set book name the column that you are trying to update the column that you are trying to update you can write the name of your column so book name equals to new value you can write the new value here so my new value is let's learn Java let's learn Java that is the new value so let's learn Java where where row name so row you can identify the row with the help of primary key with the help of primary key you can identify the row so where bookor ID equals to b001 so here you have to write the primary key here you have to write the primary key and now you can run this command now you can run this command so at the place of let's Lear python you will have less than Java so run this command and try to print your table one more time try to print your table one more time see see the database has been updated as you can see here my database has been updated here that is how you can update the values that is how you can update the values okay so this is also possible here that is how you can update the table as well so this is also possible here that is how you can update a row so for example let's say now you want to delete a rrow to delete a row so you can delete a row as well if you wanted to delete a row if you want to delete a row then you can delete a row as well so delete keyword delete keyword uh Delete keyword table name delete keyword from keyword table name their keyword okay primary key column primary primary key column sorry here you can write primary key column so the column which is your primary key the column which is your primary key that is something you can write here so primary key column equals to primary key value so where uh primary key column equals to primary key value okay that is something you can write here whatever value you will write here that value that row will be removed the row the value the primary key value the primary key value that you will write here that row will be deleted from your table that is how you can delete a row as well okay okay that is how you can delete a row as well so let me write this command as well let me write this command as well so delete from books where read from books where book andore ID equals to you can write the book ID value and you will be able to remove the book okay so what you can do so for example let's say I want to remove this row b002 I want to remove this row b 002 so I can simply write B 2 here and I can run this command and I can run this command and the row will be deleted from your table you can print your table again you can print your table again see see your row has been deleted see your b002 row has been deleted that is how you can delete a row that is also possible here that is how you can delete a row as well so this is also possible here this is also possible here this is something you can do as well that is how you can delete a row from your table as well okay now let's say you want want to delete an entire table to delete a table you want to delete your entire table here so that is something possible as well drop keyword table keyword table name and you can delete your entire table as well you can delete your entire table as well with the help of this command okay with the help of this command you can delete your entire uh table as well that is also uh that is also possible here okay this is something there's something you can do as well okay so what I'm going to do here is that now I will uh uh so what I will do here is that uh so what I will do here is that I will try to uh Delete the table here okay so a drop keyword table keyword then books and you can delete your entire table as well select this command select this command and run this one from here and you will be able to delete your entire table see your table has now been removed now if you try to print your table now if you try to print your table you will not be able to see the answer now this time you will see the this sign here for for printing the table for printing the table you will see something like that because now your table has been deleted LMS books does not exist exist books table does not exist you can see the message here you can see the message here as well that your books table doesn't exist so that is possible here but now what you can do now what you can do you can run these commands one more time so I will run fourth line one more time so table has been created now you can run this command so your row has been inserted and now you can run this third line so your books table is inser created here okay so this is what is possible here that is how you can manage your database that is how you can manage your database delete add modify all these things you can do on your database all these things you can do on your database to maintain your data properly to maintain your data properly here this is what is possible here okay so this is what you can do now in the same way just like I have created the books uh books table just like I have created the books table I will create the another other tables as well I will create the other tables as well so users table admin table issue table I will create those tables as well okay so I I can create those tables as well so create keyword table keyword users okay then inside the users you can have two two columns here user ID Vare 255 and user password these are the two columns here user uncore password so that is my VAP 255 now which one is the primary key user ID is the primary key so user ID is the primary key so primary key user ID user uncore ID that is how you can have this column here that this is that is how you can have this table here this is how you can have this table here so you can run this command you can run this command and now you will have one users table you can add some data into users table you can add some data into users table as well so insert into users values insert into users values so I can write some users uh Valu there so for example let's say Bara 109 aty library.com at theate my library.com that is the ID here for example and let's say the password is password is Bara bar 6012 something like this this is the password so that is how you are creating a login ID and the password for one student to login in your system for one student to use your services for one student to use your library management system you are making ID and password now these ID and password will be useful in the future these ID and password will be useful in the future when we will try to build up login form or something like that so you can run this command so one value has been inserted here okay you can add some more data as well so for example let's say adash 2898 at my ib.com and let's say some kind of password here maybe let something like Mumbai Mumbai aders that is the password okay that is that is for example another ID and password so I can run this command and one more row has been inserted here now you can see your data now you can see your data so select as from users select ASC from users so you can run this command and now you will be able to see your users table now you will be able to see your users table okay so my users table has two and three is here adash and baa okay so this is possible that is how you can add a users table now in the same way you can make a admin table in the same way you can have admin table as well so for example create table admin admins admin ID admin ID and admin password and uh admin ID admin ID is the primary key you can run this command and this time one admin table will be created for you now one admin table will be created for you now inside the admin table now inside the admin P table you can add some data for admin here so with the help of insert into admins values and here you can write the values here so for admin so what can I write here I can write let's say my admin my library.com and let's say the password is for example this is the password okay for example this is the password so I will have only one admin I will have only one admin H and that is the admin ID and password for them and now you can run your admin so select T from admin however you can make as many admins as you want however you can make as many admins as you want but I'm making only one administrator here so that is the admin table that is how you can have admin table now in the same way you can have one more table here by the name of let's say issue I wanted to store the DAT of issue I wanted to I wanted to store the DAT of issue so insert into oh sorry create create table issue okay issue underscore ID where 255 and let's say book id bookor id is the VAP 255 and then we have user ID VAP 255 but in this table issue ID is the primary key in this table issue ID is the primary key by issue ID is the primary key not the book ID and user ID see because primary key should always be unique it cannot be duplicated but but if you try to take real world data if you try to take real world data single book can be issued by multiple people right so book ID can be repeated and a single person can issue multiple books so user ID can also be repeated here and that is why these two are not taken as a primary key here and I will take uh issue ID as a primary key so that is something possible here that is something you can do here so primary key issue uncore ID so I will make issue ID as the primary key I will make I will make issue ID as the primary key now you can run this command now you can run this command so your issue table will also be created here now inside the issue table you can add some data so insert into issue so what I'm going to add an issue ID so in terms of issue ID I will try to store the date of issue the date and time of issue the date and time of issue that is something I will take as a issue ID okay so maybe something like maybe something like 2023 07 27 22 col 16 that is 10:00 16 uh 10 hour 16 p.m. uh 10 hours 16 minutes 10 hour 16 minute p.m. and you can write some kind of second here maybe something like 34 and you can write milliseconds as well that is the kind of primary key you can generate from for your issue why we are generating such a complicated primary key why we are generating such a primary complicated primary key because this value will be generated by user and whenever something is generated by user you do not want them to be duplicated and that is why I will generate the primary key like this one okay that is something you will be able to do here because book will be issued by user because book will be issued by user and you do not want user to give the issue ID because if the user will give issue ID the issue ID can be duplicated as well and that is why we will create the issue ID using program using programming language but not with the help of user okay then you can have book ID so book ID let's say B 003 and let's say uh uh user ID user ID can be let's say this one others 2898 my library.com so other has issued this book other has issued this book b003 at this time okay so this is what is possible here this is what you can do on your uh this is what you can do on your table okay and that is what you can write here that is what you can write here so select this command now you can select this command and run this command so now your this data will be added here this data will be added and then you can see this data as well so select EST from issue select EST from issue here select EST from issue okay that is something possible as well so you can select this command and you can run this one and see your data is available here as you can see here your data is available here so that is something you can do here okay so that is something you can do here that is how uh that is how you can make your database so we have successfully created our database see we have successfully created our database I created one database by the name of LMS which has four tables books user admin issue and all of these books table has uh these different different columns here and they have the different different primary key and where you are trying to store your data and where and where you are trying to store your data okay so this is available here this is what you can do whenever you are trying to use SQL so that is how you can use SQL SQL is a single line command language SQL is a single line command language the commands that you are going to use in SQL are single line okay and you can run these single line commands and you can run these single line commands you can run these single line commands in order to work on your database in order to work on your database here so this is what is possible here this is what you can do on your database okay this is how you can create your database that is how you can modify your database that is how you can create tables inside the database that is how you can delete tables or delete values inside the database all these things you can do here okay these are all the things that you can do inside your database here okay now for practice purpose now for practice purpose if you want to use the command line you can use the command line as well however I recommend the workbench however I only recommend the workbench here but you can use this command line here as well that for practice purpose and I can write my password Here and Now you can run your SQL commands here as well if you want to run your SQL commands in the command line so you can practice here as well so for example first of all I can uh use my database so use LMS LMS and now you can run your command so create oh sorry uh select estri from uh select from select I from users so run this command see all the data from the users table all the data from the users table will be available here all the data from the users table will be available here so that is what you can do here okay and then you can do the something opposite as well so for example maybe something like let's say I wanted to insert some row let's say I wanted to insert some row so insert into Books values let's see d004 okay and let's say uh web development we development for professionals okay and then you can write here for example let's say Alo something like Alo okay you can run this command you can run this command and see this data has been added in your database this data has been added in your database now you canun your command so select asri uh from books and of this commands see your data is available here and the same data is available here as well the same data is available in the workbench as well if you try to run the workbench if you try to run in the inside the workbench the same data you will be able to see here as well okay so you can practice at this so you can practice at these different different sources here okay so these are also possible here if you wanted to practice add these different different sources here for practice purpose for practice purpose these different different sources are very good for you you can use them according to your own requirement okay so this is what is possible here this is your today's topic

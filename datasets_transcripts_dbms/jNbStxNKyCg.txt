hello and welcome to this video on top 25 dbms interview questions with answers if you're in college you know how crucial dbms concepts are for technical interviews let me ask how many of you have faced questions about normalization form or concepts like primary key and foreign key during the placement drives you have been part of I'm 100% sure that at least once you would have gone through these questions as a computer science grad or a passour student I can tell you whenever I appeared for an interview I was at least asked a few questions about database management system kn interview honestly no interview went without the dbms interview questions if you're wondering about the reason consider this today if you go anywhere if you explore any business function be it sales marketing or development everything is fueled by data data is everywhere and obviously in order to store it you need something called as database management system I hope this clears your doubt about the importance of dbms all right guys so after understanding how important dbms interview questions are I went ahead and studied hundreds of interview that are int at Learners had appeared for while I was doing this activity I found out some set of hot questions that that recruiters often throw at the candidates so guys make sure that you're keeping your notebook and Pen handy to make the notes and get ready to a the interview questions around the dbms concepts let's look at the very first question what do you understand by dbms and state its application so imagine having a vast collection of data like student record restaurant menu or even your favorite movies and needing to organize access and update it effortlessly that's where a database management system or dbms comes in so dbms is a collection of programs that keep everything sorted secure and easy to retrieve but how does it really work with dbms you can either create database insert or update information and even run queries to extract specific data like searching for all the restaurant with the highest rating unlike old file system it avoids duplication and ensure consistency now talking about the application dbms is everywhere from Bank tracking transaction to e-commerce sites managing inventory dbms is like everywhere it provides backup and Recovery restrict unauthorized access and and makes data processing fast tools like MySQL Oracle and Amazon simple DB are some popular examples moving ahead with our next question which is what do you mean by primary key so imagine you're managing a library and each book has a unique ID number that helps you identify it instantly no matter how many similar titles or author assist that's exactly what a primary key does in a database it's a column in a table that uniquely identify each records ensuring there's no confusion or duplication for example in a table of student record the student ID column could be the primary key even if two students have the same name their unique IDs like like IDs 101 and 102 help differentiate them so primary key helps keep your data organized and reliable moving ahead with our next question which is what is the difference between unique and null constraint so in relational databases both the unique and null constraint play important role in maintaining data Integrity but they serve different purposes now talking about unique constraint it ensures that all the value in a column or combination of column are distinct what I mean by this is no two rows can have the same value in that column however unique constant allows only one null value in a colum this is useful for enforcing uniqueness without preventing missing values directly for example well a column like citizen ID can have unique values for all rows but one null value is allowed for cases where the information is not available talking about the null constraint it controls whether a column can have null values which represent missing or unknown data when a column has not null constraint it ensures that every row must have a valid notnull value in that column so in short you can say that unique constr ensures distinctness allowing only one null while the null con straint enforces the presence or absence of values moving ahead with the next question which is what is the degree of a relation so in dbms the degree of relation refers to the number of attributes or columns in a table it simply tells us how many field or pieces of information each record or rows in the table can hold for example if a table has attribute like student ID name and age it's degrees three because there are three columns in the table and here's the breakdown a table with one column is called Unity relation a a table with two columns is called binary relation and a table with three columns is called ternary relation and so on so think of it as a width of the table the more attributes the higher the degree of relation understanding the degree helps in designing efficient databases and writing queries accurately moving ahead with the next question which is differentiate between logical database design and physical database design so logical and physical database designs are two crucial stages in database development e serving a unique purpose talking about logical database design it focuses on what data should be stored and how it should be organized conceptually it defines attribute entities relationship and constraint without worrying about how the data will be stored for example a student table might include Fields like student ID name and age with relationship to other table it's more abstract and platform independent making it easier to adapt for changing business needs talking about physical database design on the other hand deals with how the data will stored in the system it specify data storage format indexing partitioning and exess method for instance dealing whether to use a hard disk or SSD or how to index a table for faster queries falls under physical design in short logical design is about structure while physical design is about the implementation both ensure efficient database performance and adaptability moving ahead with our next question which is how many types of databases languages are there so database language refers to the specific type of command or instruction used to communicate with database it helps you to create manage update and retrieve data from database so we can say that it is like a set of tools that help you talk and work with the data stored in your database talking about the database language firstly talking about data definition language or ddl which is used to define the database internal structure and pattern in this we have commands like create alter drop truncate and rename secondly we have data manipulation language or D ml which is used to manipulate the data in database by using different set of command like insert update delete and third we have data query language which helps fetch the data using select statement so that's all about this question moving ahead with our next question which is what are indexes so indexing in dbms is a technique used to quickly locate and access data in database improving query performance by reducing the number of disc reads it works like a books index pointing to the location of specific data data indexes are created on column that are frequently searched or sorted they use a search key usually a primary key or a candidate key and a data reference or a pointer that stores the address of the data on the disk while indexing speeds of the data retrieval sorting the data isn't mandatory commonly used index include primary unique and cluster index talking about our eighth question which is what is the difference between wear and having Clause wear and having Clauses and SQL are both used to filter data but they serve different purposes and operate at different stages of query execution talking about the we Clause so it filters row before any grouping occurs in the query and it works on the individual row of data and cannot use the aggregate functions like sum or count for example you can use wear Clause if you want to retrieve orders where the price is greater than 100 a simple query for this can be select star from the order where price is greater than 100 now coming to having Clause it filter Group after the grouping is done and is specifically used to aggregate function to apply condition on the group data for example you can use having claws to retrieve products where the total sales exceed 500 and the query for the same will be like select product ID comma sum of the sales you know the sum is an aggregate function from orders Group by product ID having the sum of the sales greater than 500 so in short we can say where is used to filter individual r and having is used to filter the group data together they ensure precise data selection in SQL moving ahead with our next question which is what do you mean by transaction a transaction in a database management system is a sequence of logically connected operation that are treated as a single unit so basically these operation involve Reading Writing or modifying data in the database transaction ensure that a database remain consistent reliable and free from errors even during unexpected failures like like power outage or hardware issues for example when you transfer money from One bank account to another the transaction involves two main step firstly deducing the money from one account and secondly adding it into the other account both step must either complete successfully or not at all happen to maintain the accuracy so the key operation includes read write commit and troll back transaction are essential for data integrity and consistency in modern system now talking about our last question which is what do you mean by query optimization so ever noticed how some app loads super fast while other takes a lot of time that's because of something called as query optimization in database which is like finding the fastest route to get things done so in simple terms we can say query optimization is about finding the fastest and least resource heavy way to FES the data you need the dbms looks at all possible execution path for a query and choose is the best one based on the factors like speed memory uses and CPU load talking about this importance the goal of query optimization is to reduce the system resource required to fulfill a query and ultimately provide the user with the correct result to set faster so how it does that is firstly it provides the user with faster result which makes the application seem faster to the user secondly it allows the system to service more query in the same amount of time because each take less time than unoptimized query thirdly query optimization ultimately reduces the amount of Vier on the hardware example Des drive and allows the server to run more efficiently for example lower power consumption less memory usage so query optimization keeps things running fast efficient and user friendly so starting up with the 11th question which is difference between file system and database management system okay so a file system and a database management system are two distinct method for managing data with each having its unique characteristics so talking about the file system so file system is a way of organizing files in directories and retrieving files in storage medium like a hard disk it groups files into subdirectories to make file retrieval simpler talking about the features of file system you can see here is it organizes files in directory it has higher redundency due to file duplication to about backup or recovery it has no inbu backup or recovery tool it lacks efficient query capabilities and it's very less consistent when it comes in data handling talking about the security it has limited security features and of course due to all these things it's less expensive so some of the popular examples of file system includes NTFS or EXT which is extended file system and new technology file system coming to this database management system as you all know that database management system is a software which is designed to manage and organize large amount of structured data okay and it stores data in the form of tables with rows and colums now if we talk about uh example of dbms it includes MySQL or Oracle and talking about the features it us is stable to structure data it minimizes the redundancy it provides very good backup and it offers optimized query processing with data consistency and advanced security mechanism and because of all these features it is higher in cost but offers more functionality so moving ahead with our next question which is what is a ER model in dbms so the entity relationship model is a visual representation of database structure Focus ing on like entities attributes and relationship so you can say that the entity relation model is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and the representation of how those entities are related okay so you can say there are three components in ER model which is entity attributes and relationships okay so coming back to entities so all the real will objects which which are represented in database are considered as entities for example book member librarian or anything which you can see from your eyes or any object coming to attributes so you can see suppose this is book this is a entity okay now coming back to the attributes so book ID okay all the properties of this book book name okay author all are the all are its attributes and what is the relationship relationship is connection between the entities so how two entities are being connected is called as relationships as we previously discussed the ER model has three components entity attributes and relationship so talking about a very simple example to demonstrate this suppose you have this employee okay this diamond it represents the relation and this rectangle represents the weak entity so for example talking about this employee it's a entity this has a relation okay has a relation with its dependence so here it will come dependence okay now from this you can easily make a table table in dbms so we can say that ER model helps in making the tables in dbms so these all the representation will be converted to a table so entity can be a strong entity weak entity and attributes can be of key attributes composite attributes multivalued and derived relationships one to one one to many many to one and many to many moving ahead with our next question which is difference between entity entity type and entity set okay as we previously discussed that a entity is a specific object in real world with independent existence mean it does not depend upon any other entity or any other Factor okay so any particular row is an entity okay so this particular row like one and this John John having ID one is a entity because it represents a single row or a record in a table okay so coming to entity typee entity type is a category or a schema defining the structures of entity okay so it represent the name of a table for example the name of this table is student here are you can say some values 1 2 3 name x y z age a b c okay so the schema of student table with attributes like ID name age just the overall structure with a name represents the entity type now coming back to entity set now entity set is a collection of all the entities okay for example here is ID 1 name John suppose age is 16 ID 2 name Ram age 18 ID3 Kieran age 20 so all these three records you can see here all the three records in this particular schema comes under The Entity set because it represents all the row or records of a table got it okay so moving ahead with our next question which is what do you mean by generalization and specialization in dbms so generalization is a process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and creating a generalized entity from it okay for example faculty and student so there are two entities which can be generalized into a bigger entity for example faculty is a person and student is also a person so generalization is a bottom up approach in database design which combines two or more entities with common attributes into a high level entity okay now coming back to specialization so specialization is an abstraction mechanism where a relationship and entities are treated as high level entities and it is also known as stop down approach okay so for example employee is a tester or can be a developer okay so you see it follows topone approach because this employee is being divided into two Fields so basically in specialization the entities are divided into sub entities based on their characteristics and remember they should have some common properties between them okay so moving ahead with our next next question which is what do you mean by relational algebra okay so relational algebra consist of certain sets of rule or operation that are widely used to manipulate and query data from relational database okay so it's a procedural query language providing a foundation for SQL which defines operation to transform input relation into output relation okay and what's the purpose it efficient ently manipulates the data for retrieval and it uses mathematical symbols and not English keywords which can help you understand better what's going on behind the scene now talking about the key operators we have selection projection Union set difference and cartisian product so talking about this selection so suppose you have a table okay with three columns a b and c and certain values suppose 1 2 3 4 uh 2 2 2 3 and 4 3 3 4 okay so if you have applied selection so selection symbol is this Sigma so it will what it will do it will basically filter out rows from given table based on certain condition okay so if you have put this Sigma C greater than 3 so what it will do it will select all the topples of the row which have C more than three okay so you see the more than three values are this one and this one so it will filter out and it will be giving like AB c 1 4 2 3 and this 4 4 so selection operator will do this so This selection operator operates basically on row similarly projection operators of relational algebra works on column it basically allows you to pick specific column from a given relation okay so projection symbol is pi and one of the important feature of this projection is by default projection removes all the duplicate data similarly Union as you all know Union operator is basically used to combine the result of two queries into single result okay then we have the set intersection so set difference basically provide the road that are present in one row and is not there in another row in maths also you must have read about this so a minus B will give all the elements present in a but not in B okay I was telling about set difference now coming back to set intersection so set intersection will give everything present in column A a and column B all the commons now coming back to cartisian product so cartisian product or cross product basically is represented by X and it combines every row of one table with every row of another table so a b c d suppose you have four rows so every row of one like this okay this is the cardian product and then come the rename operation it basically renames the table name okay that's all for this question moving ahead with our next question which is what do you mean by normalization so this is one of the very important question which are usually asked in all the interviews so you can go on by saying that normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce the redundancy and dependency and what purpose it solves it ensures data consistency and improve database efficiency and how does it work it works by dividing a larger table into smaller and related table okay so as you can see here we have 1 NF 2 NF 3 NF 4 NF and 5 NF in 3 NF we also have bcnf boy Cod normal form so now talking about the 1 NF this is the most basic level of normalization and in one NF each table cell should contain only a single value and each value you should have a unique name okay so for example you have a table here okay name and phone number okay suppose X is there and Y is there okay so X can have two phone numbers okay and this y similarly can have two phone numbers so what it does that it violates the rule of normalization because a table like X cannot have two values okay so maybe you can convert this table into one NF and after conversion what it will look like it will be like X having its F first number here second number here Y is having first here and then second here so each table should contain the atomic values similarly second NF so a relation will be in two n if if it is in one normal form and all the non key attributes are fully functional dependent upon the primary key okay so no no such value or no such field in a table should be there which is not dependent upon the primary key okay coming to 3 NF so 3 NF a third normalization form it builds on 2 NF meaning a table should be in 2 NF by requiring that all the non-key attributes are independent of each other which means that each column should be directly related to the primary key and not to the other columns in the same table okay so 2 NF should be there and no transitive dependencies should exist transitive dependency meaning if a is there to be and B is connected to C then a should not connect to C coming to bcnf or boycot normal form which is a stricter form of 3nf which ensures that each determinant in a table is kind of candidate key so in simpler words we can say that boycot normal form ensures that each non-key attributes is dependent on the candidate key okay so coming to four 4 NF which is a further refinement of boycot normal form so a relation will be in 4nf if it is in bcnf and has no multivalue dependency similarly 5nf is not that asked in interviews but to your information a relation is in 5nf if it is in 4nf and it does not contain any join dependency and joinings should be lossless meaning that no values after joining tabl should be lost moving ahead with our next question which is explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered index so in the start we already discussed that index is a disk based structure which is linked to a table or a view that facilitates quicker row retrieval okay so what do you mean by clustered indexing so in clustered indexing data is stored and sorted physically in the table okay okay and only one cluster index per table is there which is which results in faster for range queries okay so if I were to explain clustered indexing in detail suppose you have a schema okay suppose you have this schema create table a phone book okay and it consists of course last name uh first name phone number and your uh data Type L okay size okay so and suppose you have four records for this particular schema suppose you have four records here like k last name suppose Kumar here RAM and here his phone number 88 something okay suppose here you have something AAL um V name is suppose name is Von and you have phone record here similarly Mishra something name and phone number again Shri shash and this phone number and what will happen in cluster indexing the rearrangements will be done like this a pointer will be there it will be pointing to this and all these three records will be sorted in ascending or descending order based on the requirements so you have seen here a it will come here then K then M and so there will be one schema here then other SCH schema repeat then other schema here okay and then this will be organized to a bigger form okay so this is how the cluster indexing works that it simplifies or reorders by pointing back to like this okay and on what basis they are sorted so they can be sorted on the basis of primary key or any other condition which you specify now coming back to non-clustered indexing so the non-clustered index is similar to the index of a book okay so you all have searched for specific topics or title present in your books right and how do you search sub uh just think if index wouldn't be there how difficult it would be be to search for a particular keyword by looking at each and every page so similarly to tackle that problem in dbm is non-cluster indexing is present so talking about the key points so multiple non-cluster indexes are allowed per table and which is ideal for searching specific columns and of course is slower than the cluster index for retrieval okay so the data is stored in one place and the index is stored in another place and since the the data and non-clustered indexes stored separately you can have multiple non-clustered indexes in a table so talking about the example suppose you have this record pointer okay and particular schemas okay 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay So This Record uh suppose and here you have 5714 83 62 so the record pointer will be pointing like this okay the index contains the pointer to the data and you can see here that the copy of this data is the index not the original value okay so that's all for clustered and non-clustered indexing moving ahead with our next question which is what are triggers okay so a trigger is like an automatic rule or you can say BTS action that database runs for you you don't have to tell it to do something happening each time okay it just happens when a specific event occurs for example a trigger could automatically update a record send a notification or log an entry whenever a new row is is added to a table so you must have heard some people saying that bright light triggered the headache so triggered is what the automatic action okay uh similarly taking the example suppose this is a shopping cart okay so whenever you are adding a new order okay plus one you're adding then in cart or in flip card or MRA you must have seen that there comes a pop notification that item is added to cart right what's that that's the trigger and why to use trigger because it reduces the manual work it keeps the table synchronized and it tracks changes automatically so how do trigger works okay there are basically three conditions firstly database action so a trigger listens for certain actions on a table so these actions could be insert update or delete inserting meaning adding new data updating meaning changing the existing data and deleting meaning removing the record so the trigger has a condition that checks if action should actually happen and if the condition is met the trigger takes action if it does not nothing happened and then even response okay this will check the action and then this will response so once the trigger did the action it runs a predefined task such as updating another table okay or logging changes for auditing purpose or send sending an alert to the database administrator so talking about the simple Syntax for creating triggers which is you will write create trigger okay and then give your trigger a name trigger name okay then before and after after Okay so this will uh specify when the trigger will be executed so what trigger you want to insert update or delete what trigger you want to perform on specify the table name on which you want to perform your trigger then for what row you want suppose for each row and then comes the trigger body okay so this provide the operation to be performed as the triggered is fire okay so moving ahead with our next question which is what are Integrity constraints so Integrity constraints are set of predefined rules that are used to maintain the quality of information which ensures that the data remains accurate consistent and reliable in the database so you can say they act as guideline ensuring that data in the database remain accurate and consistent so Integrity constraints are used to basically protect your databases during insertion updating and deletion and which ensure that data relationship remains valid so now talking about the types of Integrity constraint we have domain constraint not null entity key primary key and referential integrity constraints so we'll be talking about few of them so what a domain constraint it defines valid value for an attribute for example age must be an integer not a string okay so if domain constraint is applied here then here you are inserting 20 22 21 23 why because of domain constraint it says that age can only consist numerical values and not the values in form of strings okay not n constraint it ensures attributes cannot have the null values meaning this semester it can't be empty okay that's not null coming to entity Integrity it says that primary key must not be null so in this case the student ID it serves at the primary key right because it's specific and it's Unique for each and every record so it can't be null so it's a primary key constraint talking about referential integrity constraint it says that foreign key must match the primary key in the related table for example this is a student table right suppose this is a student table so suppose you have an another table which is course okay so student ID is there name is there and then age is there so this student ID serves as the foreign key and what referential integy constraint says that foreign key must be the primary keys in the related table so this course table and this student table is related because of this student ID so what's this saying that student ID must be a primary key in both the tables okay so that's all for this question moving head with our next question which is how is pattern matching done in SQL so what's a pattern matching pattern matching is in SQL is the process of searching for specific text pattern with a columns data and what we use we use this like operator for pattern matching in SQL okay so this m% it matches for zero or more characters and this matches for only one character so example if you want to find names ending with Y suppose we have two names Mary and Anthony from suppose any table and you want to find out the name which are ending with Y so what you will do you will write the simple piece of code which is Select from employe suppose you have this employee table where name like m% y so it will list all the name which are ending with Y okay or find the names with a as the second character so what you will do you will write select star from employee table where name like just one simple Dash a person because I want the second character to be a so the output will be David and Sam from a specific table because in both the names the second character is a so moving ahead with our next question which is what is concurrency control in database management system so concurrency control ensures that multiple transactions run simultaneously without data inconsistency which helps an increase of efficiency and which maintains data consistency so concurrency control deals with the intered execution of more than one transaction and what I mean by transaction is transaction is a collection of operations that perform a single logical function in a database application okay for example debit of a or credit of B the amount deducted and the amount credited in B must remain consistent after this whole transaction is taken place and how does it is being insured it's being insured by concurrency control so now talking about some of the problems and mechanism of concurrency control so problem is a read write problem or lost updates and mechanism is lock shared two-phase locking or time stamp talking about read write problem so read write problem occurs when one transaction updates an item but due to some unconditional even that transaction fail but before the transaction performs roll back some another transaction reads the updated value so suppose you're having two transaction T1 and T2 so suppose transaction is happening of debiting and crediting the money so minus 50 happened from transaction T1 it modified the database okay that okay minus 50 has been given to T2 but in reality this 50 has not been debited from T1 now T2 reads the same value the same original value suppose say T1 has the original value of 100 now T2 will read the same value as 100 thus T2 will be reading the same uncommitted date of of T1 which is no longer valid thus creating inconsistency in the database so this comes under read write problem talking about lost update problem so lost update problem occurs when two or more transaction modify the same data resulting in the update being overwritten okay again two transaction T1 T2 data is 50 now T1 is adding + 10 in 50 it becomes 60 okay so database has got okay now my value is 60 now T2 will come it will also add + 20 now data will base will become it was 60 now it will occur 80 so T2 updates the same data based on the initial read and perform the commit so this will result in the modification of T1 data because T1 modified the data by 60 but now T2 will again modify the same data to 18 so it will cause a lost update problem in the database so what's the mechanism shared lock shared lock is also known as read write lock which allows multiple transaction but you can say it will put a lock that okay now this will happen T1 is doing the stuff now at the same time T2 can't update that data okay so that comes under the shared or exclusive lock now coming back to two-phase locking so two-phase locking is widely used technique which ensure strict ordering of log acquisition and release and now coming back to time stamps so time stamps is nothing but a time in which transaction enters into system okay so for example uh 1 to 5 Seconds P1 will acquire the system so at this particular point of time no other transaction should occur so that is all for the concurrency control moving ahead with our next question which is what are the type of keys present in database management system okay so in dbms what are keys keys are the attributes or set of attributes that you uniquely identify records in a table and establish relationship between tables okay so I'll be explaining you this with a simple example okay so this particular table covers all the key present so super key what are super key Super Key you can say key of keys you must have heard like King of Kings okay so super Keys is like key of keys so in this particular table this employee ID okay which is helping to identify all the records of stable uniquely is called a primary key okay coming back to foreign key so foreign key is a key which helps in determining relation from one table to another so in this case did serves as the foreign key because it helps in the connecting of two tables so candidate key is the keyy which consist all the possible columns which are worthy of becoming primary key but are not primary key and primary key can be chosen from one of the candidate keys so see employee ID employee license and employee passport all can become a primary key and from this employee ID is being chosen as a primary key okay any key other than primary key serves as the alternate key okay similarly Keys helping in determining the columns uniquely called as unique key the only difference between primary key and unique key is primary key cannot be null but unique key can be de okay so I hope you got this the type of keys present in database but uh for your better understanding here we have the definition also so candidate Keys is minimal set of attributes to identify a tle primary key a choosen candidate key to uniquely identify roles Super Key any set of attributes that can uniquely identified tles alternate key a candidate key which is not chosen as primary key foreign key refers to primary key of another table composite key a combination of two or more attributes okay so moving ahead with our next question which is what are the different levels of abstraction of dbms so you know database system comprises complex data structure and in order to make the system efficient in terms of retrieval of data and reduce complexity many of the developers use the term abstraction which is hiding the underlying details from the user okay so there are three levels of abstraction physical logical and view so we'll be talking firstly about the physical level so this is the lowest level as you can see here is this is the lowest level of data abstraction which tells how the data is actually stored so it tells the how so these are accessed by only the database administrators also known as dbas and the taskar is to manage storage indexing backup and Recovery suppose we need to store the details of an employee so block of storage and the amount of money used for this purposes are kept hidden from the users so user doesn't actually needs to know that what amount of memories required if we want to store the information about employees okay so moving ahead with logical level so logical level comprises the information that is actually stored in the database in form of table so it contains the information of table info of table and these are accessed by DBS and developers task is to Define table relationship and the constraint for example employee table with their attributes like employee ID name and Department these all comes Under The Logical level so log iCal level thus describes the entire database in terms of small number of relatively simple structures okay and these are sometimes known as physical data Independence so database administrator who must decide what information to keep in database use the logical level physical level consisted of how this will consist of what now talking to the view level in dbms so this is the highest level of abstraction ction and only a small part of actual database is viewed by the users and it is simplified for user interface to access the data and who can access it the end user and what's the task task is to display the data relevant to users based on their role for example manager sees the name and salary HR sees the name and department and contact info so everybody sees the requirement based on the respective departments so the view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system so moving ahead with our next question which is differentiate between two tire and three Tire architecture okay so when you are building a system that uses a database the architecture you choose is the key how everything work together okay so talking about the twoti architecture in two Tire setup you have the user interface or the client and the database on other side with the two directly communicating so there is a direct connection between the client and the database talking about the features of course because there is direct communication it's very simple and easy to build and of course it's ideal for small application for example contact management reservation system talking about the drawbacks it is less secure because client has directly access to the database and performance issues as user increases so as the user will increase the performance will degrade so the interface is usually located in the users's desktop and database management system are usually in a server okay now talking about the three Tire architecture in three Tire architecture the application logic or process lives in the middle Tire this is the logic and it is separated from data and the user interface so application layer here as acts as medium between client and the database talking about the features it's more secure because users don't directly have the access to the database and it is ideal for complex system for example web application but the drawback here is it requires more effort to build and maintain because one has to maintain the application server so two Tire database is a client server architecture CLA and it is web based application okay so I would recommend you guys to go through the differences because it's often asked in the interviews moving ahead to our last question which is there's a table where only one row is fully repeated write a query to find the repeated row okay so you see here is a table with name and section and you see that one row is fully repeated like ABC and ABC section cs1 is coming twice so what query we can perform is we can select name section okay name and section because we want both the column from table okay Group by name we'll group

hello everyone welcome to this video tutorial on er diagram in dbms by simply learn in this session we will learn about ear diagram starting with what is an er diagram and why it's been so much used by the companies then we will learn about the symbols used in the ear diagram and get familiar with the components of it so hey everyone i am abhishar abuja from simply learn and welcome to this video on er diagram in dbms but before we begin if you love watching tech videos subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update let's start have you ever wondered how these big ecommerce companies manage their tons of data that keeps updating every second and these datasets keep on updating in their databases to perform operations on this data they should have a conceptual understanding of these databases and this is done by understanding er diagrams of the databases so let's understand what an ear diagram is an entity relationship diagram describes the relationship of entities that needs to be stored in a database er diagram is mainly a structural design for the database it is a framework made using specialized symbols to define the relationship between entities er diagrams are created based on the three main components entities attributes and relationships let's understand the use of er diagram with the help of a real-world example here a school needs all its student records to be stored digitally so they approach an id company to do so a person from the company will meet the school authorities not all their requirements describe them in the form of year diagram and get it close checked by the school authorities as the school authorities approved the ear diagram the database engineers would carry further implementation let's have a view of an ear diagram the following diagram showcases two entities student and course and the relationship the relationship described between student and course is many to many as a course can be opted by several students and a student can opt for more than one course here student is the entity and it possesses the attributes that is student id student name and student age and the course entity has attributes such as course id and course name now we have an understanding of er diagram let us see why it has been so popular the logical structure of the database provided by air diagram communicates the landscape of business to different teams in the company which is eventually needed to support the business ear diagram is a gui representation of the logical structure of a database which gives a better understanding of the information to be stored in a database database designers can use er diagrams as a blueprint which reduces complexity and helps them save time to build databases quickly ear diagrams helps you identify the entities that exist in a system and the relationships between those entities after knowing its uses now we should get familiar with the symbols used in ear diagram the rectangle symbol represents the entities oval symbol represents attributes a rectangle embedded in a rectangle represents a weak entity a dashed oval represents a derived attribute a diamond symbol represents a relationship among entities double over symbol represents multi-valued attributes now we should dive in and learn about the components of er diagram there are three main components of fear diagram entity attribute and relationship entities have weak entity attributes are further classified into key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute relationships are also classified into one-to-one relationships one-to-many relationships many-to-one relationships and many-to-many relationships let's understand these components of fear diagram starting with entities an entity can be either a living or a non-living component an entity is showcased as a rectangle in an er diagram let's understand this with the help of an ear diagram here both student and course are in rectangular shape and are called entities and they represent the relationship study in a diamond shape let's transition to weak entity an entity that makes a lines over another entity is called a weak entity the weak entity is showcased as a double rectangle in er diagram in the example below the school is a strong entity because it has a primary key attribute school number unlike the school the classroom is a weak entity because it does not have any primary key and the room number attribute here acts only as a discriminator and note of primary key now let us know about attributes attribute an attribute exhibits the properties of an entity an attribute is illustrated with an oval shape in an er diagram in the example below student is an entity and the properties of student such as address age name and role number are called its attributes let's see our first classification under attribute that is key attribute the key attribute uniquely identifies an entity from an entity set the text of a key attribute is underlined in the example below we have a student entity and it has attributes name address row number and age but here row number can uniquely identify a student from a set of students that's why it is termed as a key attribute now we will see composite attribute an attribute that is composed of several other attributes is known as a composite attribute and oval showcases the composite attribute and the composite attribute oval is further connected with other roles in the example below we can see an attribute name which can have further subparts such as first name middle name and last name these attributes with further classification is known as composite attribute now let's have a look at multi-valued attribute an attribute that can possess more than one value are called multi-valued attributes these are represented as double oval shape in the example below the student entity has attributes phone number roll number name and age out of these attributes phone number can have more than one entry and the attribute with more than one value is called multivalued attribute let's see derived attribute an attribute that can be derived from other attributes of the entity is known as a derived attribute in the er diagram the derived attribute is represented by dashed over and in the example below student entity has both date of birth and age as attributes here age is a derived attribute as it can be derived by subtracting current date from the student date of birth now after knowing attributes let's understand relationship in er diagram a relationship is showcased by the diamond shape in the ear diagram it depicts the relationship between two entities in the below example student study course here both student and course are entities and studies the relationship between them now let's go through the type of relationship first is one-to-one relationship when a single element of an entity is associated with a single element of another entity this is called one-to-one relationship in the example below we have student and identification card as entities we can see a student has only one identification card and an identification card is given to one student it represents a one-to-one relationship let's see the second one one-to-many relationship when a single element of an entity is associated with more than one element of another entity is called one-to-many relationship in the below example a customer can place many orders but a particular order cannot be placed by many customers now we will have a look at many to one relationship when more than one element of an entity is related to a single element of another entity it is called many-to-one relationship for example students have to opt for a single course but a course can be obtained by number of students let's see many-to-many relationship when more than one element of an entity is associated with more than one element of another entity is called many-to-many relationship for example an employee can be assigned to many projects and many employees can be assigned to a particular project now after having an understanding of pr diagram let us know the points to keep in mind while creating the ear diagram first identify all the entities in the system embed all the entities in a rectangular shape and label them appropriately this could be a customer a manager an order an invoice a schedule etc identify relationships between entities and connect them using a diamond in the middle illustrating the relationship do not connect relationships connect attributes with entities and label them appropriately and the attributes should be in our chip assure that each entity only appears a single time and eradicate any redundant entities or relationships in the ear diagram make sure your er diagram supports all the data provided to design the database make effective use of colors to highlight key areas in your diagrams with that we have come to the end of this session i hope it was exciting and informative if you liked it please let us know in the comment section also do subscribe to our channel and

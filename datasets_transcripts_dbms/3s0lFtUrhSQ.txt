SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is 
used to communicate with databases, allowing us   to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from 
a database. It uses simple English-like commands,   making it easy to learn and use. It's also 
widely used in many applications, from websites   to mobile apps. In this video, I’ll give you a 
beginner-level understanding of SQL which will   help you handle and manage data efficiently. So, 
let's get started! Firstly, we need to understand   what is a Database Management System (or DBMS): 
Well, fundamentally, it is a software that enables   users to interact with databases. It provides an 
interface to define, create, and manage databases.   Popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, 
SQL Server, and SQLite, etc. a specific type of   database managed by DBMS is a Relational Database, 
which organizes data into tables with rows and   columns. Here, each table represents an entity, 
and each row represents a record or an instance   of that entity. Similarly, columns contain 
attributes or properties of that entity.   There’s something called as CRUD 
Operations which stand for Create, Read,   Update, and Delete, and are the fundamental 
operations for managing data in a database.   Create is used to insert new records into a 
table, Read is used to retrieve data from a table,   Update is used to modify existing records, and 
Delete is used to remove records from a table.   Further, to interact with any database, 
we use something called as SQL Queries…   we can define SQL queries as commands or 
instructions you give to a database to ask for,   add, modify, or delete information. In essence, 
the basic SQL commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,   DELETE, and JOIN. These queries allow us to 
retrieve, add, modify, or delete data from the   database. Let's understand these basic commands 
one by one, starting with SELECT Statement:   It is used to retrieve data from the database. 
It allows you to specify the columns you want   to retrieve and the conditions for filtering 
the data using the WHERE clause. The syntax   for the same is, Here, this “condition” 
in WHERE clause is used as a filter that   specifies which rows from a table should be 
included in the query's result. This way,   it allows you to narrow down the data and retrieve 
only the records that meet certain criteria.   And do note that in most SQL database management 
systems, each SQL statement or command ends with   a semicolon (;) Next is INSERT Statement: 
It is used to add new records to a table,   wherein, we specify the values for each column 
in the new row. The syntax for the same is   Next, UPDATE Statement: which is used to modify 
existing records in a table. It allows us to   change the values of specific columns based on 
certain conditions. The syntax for the same is,   Next, DELETE Statement which is used to 
remove records from a table based on specified   conditions. The syntax for the same is, And 
lastly, the JOIN statement is used to combine rows   from two or more tables based on a related column 
between them. There are different types of JOINs,   including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, 
and FULL JOIN, but the basic syntax for the most   common JOINs is as follows: In the JOIN syntax, 
table1 and table2 are the names of the tables   you want to join, and column_name is the common 
column between these tables on which the join is   based. By using JOINs, you can efficiently combine 
data from different tables to extract meaningful   information from a relational database. Next, 
lets continue on SQL concepts, starting with,   Data Types: Well, in SQL, each column in a 
table has a data type that defines the type   of data it can store. Common data types include 
INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, and BOOLEAN, among others.   Similar to them, we have Constraints, which 
are rules defined on tables to maintain data   integrity. Common constraints are PRIMARY KEY 
(ensures the uniqueness of a column's values),   FOREIGN KEY (maintains referential 
integrity between two tables),   NOT NULL (ensures a column must have a value), 
and UNIQUE (ensures unique values in a column).   If you want to understand all types of keys 
in a DBMS, you can refer to this video.   Next, we have Indexes, that are database objects 
used to speed up data retrieval. They allow the   database system to find and access data more 
quickly, especially for large tables. And as   you must already know, speed in everything when 
it comes to database management… as any database   needs to perform a certain set of functions, most 
common ones are aggregate functions like SUM, AVG,   COUNT, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations 
on sets of data, returning a single result.   Here, a GROUP BY clause is usually used in 
conjunction with aggregate functions to group   data based on specific columns. It is typically 
used in combination with functions like SUM or   COUNT to get summary results. Here’s a 
sample syntax for your understanding,   Here, SELECT: Specifies the columns to be 
retrieved in the result. column1: is the column   you want to group by. This can be any column in 
the table. SUM(column2): The aggregate function   SUM calculates the total of values in column2 for 
each group. table_name: The name of the table you   are querying. One thing you should remember 
is that when you use the GROUP BY clause, the   SELECT statement should include either the columns 
used for grouping or the aggregate functions used   to calculate values within each group. Next, 
there’s another clause called ORDER BY which   is used to sort the result set in ascending or 
descending order based on one or more columns.   And when combined with an aggregate function like 
COUNT(), it allows us to sort the result based on   the count of occurrences of a specific value 
or the number of rows returned for each group.   Here’s an example syntax, Here, SELECT: Specifies 
the columns you want to retrieve from the table,   including the column you want to count occurrences 
of. COUNT(column_name): counts the occurrences of   the specified column values. You can also use 
COUNT(*) to count the total number of rows in   each group. AS count_alias: is somewhat 
of an optional part. It allows you to   provide an alias (a.k.a a custom name) for the 
count result, making the output more readable.   FROM table_name: Specifies the name of the table 
from which you are retrieving the data from.   GROUP BY column_name: again, groups the result set 
by the specified column, so the COUNT() function   calculates the count for each group separately. 
And lastly, ORDER BY count_alias [ASC | DESC]:   This part sorts the result set based on the 
count value. You can use either ASC (ascending)   or DESC (descending) to specify the sorting 
order. Next, there’s the concept of a subquery,   which is also known as an inner query or nested 
query. Fundamentally, by definition, it is a query   that is embedded within another query. It is used 
to retrieve data that will be used as a filter or   condition in the main query. More on this in 
a separate video, but here’s a sample syntax,   The main advantage of using a subquery is that 
it allows us to perform complex filtering and   data retrieval in a more organized and efficient 
manner. Next, we have Views, which are virtual   tables created by queries and can be used like 
regular tables. They provide a way to simplify   complex queries and restrict access to sensitive 
data. Here’s the sample syntax of a View,   Next, we have Transactions, that are nothing but 
sequences of one or more SQL operations treated   as a single unit. The purpose of a transaction 
is to ensure that a series of related database   operations either all succeed or all fail. This 
is equally important as it helps in maintaining   data integrity and consistency in SQL. This 
property of transactions is often referred   to as the ACID properties, which stands for 
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.   Furthermore, transactions have a significant 
impact on the reliability and correctness   of database operations as well. Here’s a 
sample syntax of a transaction in SQL, Next,   we have the concept of Normalization, which is 
fundamentally the process of organizing data in a   database to eliminate redundancy and improve data 
integrity. It involves dividing a database into   tables and defining relationships between them. We 
have another thing in SQL called Stored Procedures   which are primarily precompiled SQL code that can 
be stored and executed on the database server.   They also help in improving performance and 
security. Lastly, we have the concept of Triggers,   which are database objects that automatically 
execute in response to specific events,   such as data modification, thereby, ensuring data 
consistency and integrity. Here’s the syntax for   the same, CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER: This is 
the beginning of the trigger creation statement.   The OR REPLACE keyword is optional and allows 
us to modify an existing trigger with the same   name. trigger_name: is the name we give to the 
trigger. {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF}: specifies   when the trigger will be activated concerning the 
triggering event. BEFORE triggers are executed   before the triggering event, AFTER triggers are 
executed after the triggering event, and INSTEAD   OF triggers are executed instead of the triggering 
event (used in certain cases like with views).   {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}: This specifies the 
type of action that will activate the trigger.   [FOR EACH ROW]: is the clause used when you want 
the trigger to be fired for each affected row   in the table. It is usually used in row-level 
triggers and, BEGIN ... END; is the body of the   trigger where you write the SQL statements that 
should be executed when the trigger is activated.   With that, I hope this video was helpful

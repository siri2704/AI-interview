so as I already explained there are if there are three read log files like this so one switch will happen second switch will happen but during the third switch the first log is already having some data in that case it need to override this first log file so for that reason uh the checkpoint U for every checkpoint dbwr need to write the data but dbwr is not uh since dbwr should save all the data in a parallel manner so it will not write in a single process it will it will be having multiple parallel um threads which will write all the data to the disk so since multiple parallel process needs to coordinate so it will take a it will take some time to write all the dirty buffers why because dirty um buffer cache contains some huge amount of data sometimes

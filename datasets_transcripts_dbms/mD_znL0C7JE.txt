should you choose a nosql database over an SQL database there's three things to consider number one what gives you more consistency guarantee it's an SQL database but if you don't need consistency and more control over it nosql gives you a lot of tools a lot of methods by which you can configure the consistency number two what is built for scale nosql databases are usually built for scale they have inbuilt capabilities of sharding leader election Quorum which really help you as you need to scale your rights number three what about transaction support SQL gives you inbuilt transaction support nosql gives you something called base transaction support which is just a polite way of saying we don't give you transaction support So if you're okay with lesser consistency and you're looking to really scale as much as possible you're probably looking at a nosql database

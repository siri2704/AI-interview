[Music] hi everyone welcome back to techno on tech TV in this tutorial I will show you how to draw an ER diagram for Airline reservation system so if you don't know how to draw an ER diagram and what are the components of ER diagram then I have added the video link on the upper right corner of your screen so watch that video first ER diagram for online Airline reservation system is a visual presentation of entities and relationships of Airline reservation system software database so here I am taking only six entities users ticket flight payment Airline and class so here users are customer and admin so customer and the admin are the two parties which are allowed to have access to the database of the system and have different view level of schemas to the database information now let's define the relationship between all the entities so there will be two relationship between user and ticket that is book and cancel user can book the ticket as well as he or she can cancel it next relationship between user and flight will be user checks for flight so after flight booking user always checks for flight information and also at the time of booking we check for availability right and flight has different classes like business and economy class Etc so I am adding has relationship between flight and class and there should be a relationship between ticket and payment so I am adding relation receive between ticket and payment so ticket receive payment relationship between flight and Airline will be flight belong to Airline so these are the relationship which I have defined in these six entities now let's see the cardinality ratio between these entities so one user can book and cancel many tickets right so once we book ticket we have to pay money so for one ticket there will be one payment or one total amount and one user can check for different flight information and different flight availabilities next is flight and class so one flight has different classes like economy and business Etc last is flights and Airline so many flights belong to one Airline so this is the cardinality ratio between these entities now come to the attributes so for entity ticket I am adding eight attributes PNR number seat number flight number passenger name date and time class source and destination and PNR number is the primary key here so let's see the attributes for entity user so first is username and this is the key attribute and second attribute is name so here basically I am using composite attribute so we have break down the name attribute into two sub attributes that is first name and last name and we have used multi-valued attribute for mobile number because one user can have various contact numbers next is date of birth attribute here user ages uh derive attribute as it changes over time and can be derived from another attribute date of birth next is address attribute here user address is a composite attribute as an address is composed of other attributes such as pin code State country and last is gender attribute now next is entity flight so here flight number is the key attribute and we have six simple attributes that is flight name departure time arrival time Source destination seat availability and distance next we have class entity so for this we have three attributes flight number fair and Class Type and flight number is the primary key so here I am adding double line which means total participation that is why it is also called as mandatory participation and if we add only one line then it is optional or we can say it's partial participation so in a flight it is mandatory like flight should have different classes so for class entity I am adding specialization specialization is a top-down approach in specialization one higher level entity can be broken down into two lower level entities so if you don't know about specialization and generalization concept then I have added the video link on the upper right corner of your screen so click on that link and watch that video first so class entity can be specialized as economy and business class for airline entity I have added two attributes that is Airline name contact number and here Airline name is the primary key and last we have payment entity so for this we can add three attributes transaction ID amount and payment mode and transaction ID is the primary key here so this is how you can draw an ER diagram on different topics so this is just an example you can add various entities and different attributes according to you and if you want to watch ER diagram tutorial on different topics then I have added the playlist on the upper right corner of your screen as well as in the description box so you can check that playlist also so that's it for this

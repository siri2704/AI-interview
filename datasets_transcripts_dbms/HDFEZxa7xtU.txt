hello everyone welcome to the exam prep tool and this in this today's lecture we will try to cover the same concepts which is the database and database management system in the last lecture we have seen more of definition right so we will see more in depth today each and every point right okay so this lecture is as part of the course which is industry G ready course on DSA and Oracle database including the realtime project right so right now demo sessions are happening please try to watch those and if you feel it is interesting and if it helpful for you try to enroll the program and to help you more so we are providing you 50% off on all our courses batch is already started right now demo demos are happening try to utilize the classes right and as you know that we have a very limited seats try to enroll the program and if you have any doubts or concerns you can reach out to us we will try to help you right in the last class we have seen the definition of the what is the database right and also we have seen what is the definition of the DBMS right let me tell you what is the definition of The um database again a database is a well organized and structured collection of logically interrelated data that is stored electronically in a systematic format right this is a formal definition in a simple terminology you can say it is kind of repository where the data is stored for a future reference purpose right when you see the formal definition I I said database is a well organized and structured collection of right what do you mean by the well organized what do you mean by the structured collection what do you mean by the logically interrelated data understand carefully terminology what do you mean by the well organized when you say database is a well organized structured collection of logically interrelated data right but what do you mean by the well organized what do you mean by the structured collection and what do you mean by the logically interrelated right none of you asked me so I thought to help you with the more information because here you are not writing any academic exams semester exams so you need to understand each and everything in a practical way so then then only we learn the subject very properly right try to think what do you mean by the well organized what do you mean by the structured collection and what do you mean by the logically interrelated data and we will break down each and every terminology properly in a practical way right this is the one of the definition that we have seen in the last class and one more thing is what is mean by the database management system right I don't go too much depth into this part definition part but we will cover the database definition in a more elaborated way DBMS we will see in the next lecture right more more points about DBMS and RDBMS and right so in a simple terminology you can say DBMS is a software that acts as an intermediary between the user or applications and the database database is sitting between the user applications or maybe the user or maybe the application programs you can say front end and the database what DBMS is doing here can you tell me it is communicating with the database for what purpose it is communicating can you tell me to store the data to retrieve the data to manage the data to manipulate the data in simple terminology you can say that efficient management of data right and also it is providing the not only uh getting the data managing the data it is also providing some more features like enforcing the security and access control data integrity data consistency concurrency control there are so many things out there during the course you will see so so much of information about this right now we will get into our actual topic right now let me cover one more point before going to the next topic what is that what if database management system is not there how can you interact with the database can you tell me right you are saying that DBMS is a software what do you mean by the software here can you tell me right it is a set set of programs right it is a set of programs now if DBMS is not there then what what you have to do you you have to write your own programs your own set of programs to communicate with the database in order to store the information in order to retrieve the information in order to manage it properly you have to write your own program programs which will make your task very very difficult right so that is why so many vendors came and they have provided us what database management system softwares like what now I'm talking about the more of Oracle right in this course who provided the Oracle database software to you Oracle Corporation right and similarly you can say Microsoft SQL server right SQL server provided by the Microsoft corporation right like that there are so many uh softwares also there in market right we will see in one separate session so now enter into our actual topic for the today right what do you mean by the well organized data tell me what do you mean by the well organized data if you don't organize what happens that is my question so this is the this terminology is part of the database definition we are trying to understand the database definition in a more in detailed way because if you understand this terminologies this definition properly so then your journey becomes very easy right and I have taken some examples also real time examples which will create interest to you to learn the subject right now tell me what do you mean by the well organized what happens if you don't organize the data You all know that business organizations always generate the data and it will store permanently to serve better in future right now how it is storing the data that is what my question right how it is storing the data based on database to database suppose let's say if you talk about the relational database management system which is storing the data in in the form of the table right in the form of what table format right table is containing the rows and the columns that you know right and if you talk about the document based databases it is storing in the form of collections in the document format JSON format will be there which is a semi ststructured data it is storing in a Okay yes no SQL databases right document database also people call sometime right now come back here what do you mean by well organized right no see here definition so no well organized means when you say the business is generating the organized data you must store somewhere right but you can't store randomly whatever the way that you want let us assume Netflix netflix is generating the data how it is storing the data of the customers means you can say users and it is storing the data of the movies and it is storing the data of the uh ratings right and watch history of the users right but if you store the entire all this data of the business what happens it is too complex to manage when when the business is grows right when the business is growing when the business is growing If you store the entire data in a one particular table it will become very complex that is why I say don't store entire data of the business into single table instead try to divide the table into the data into category wise into multiple tables logically divide the data of data of the business into multiple table each table must have a specific purpose are you getting so I have written something you can see here in the context of database well organized mean data is not stored randomly in one or one large or messy table but instead it is divided logically across the multiple tables that is what I said right each with a specific purpose right just like uh I'm talking about Netflix right we will see in this session more into Netflix example Right so I'm just telling so if you store entire business data in a single table what happens right can you tell me so now you are saying you wanted to store the data of the Netflix if you store entire business data into one particular table what happens it will create a lot of problems what are the problems there may be sometimes the repeated data will be there it will generate difficult to manage if the data is if the business is growing it is very very difficult to manage right eventually the performance of the database will become right slow it will create lot of inconsistency also right if you store in one particular place it will create a lot of problems in terms of performance in terms of maintenance in terms of and also one more important thing is that if anything happens to the data ASE backup and recovery that is very very important thing right there are so many things will be there it will create lot of problem that is why databases in the databases always tables are or always data is organized into the multiple tables to facilitate easier access to the developer or user right now here uh we are talking about Amazon like see here how we organize the data into multiple well- definfined tables like if you take about Amazon users related information orders related information product related information delivery related information and each will be linked to each other right each table each table will be linked to the some other table that is a relationship right I hope you understood what I'm saying right now see here real time example now I'm saying that Netflix example see here so how can Can you take a scenario of the Netflix database with a limited set of tables how can you divide the business data how can you store the business data in the uh tables right take the few set of tables how can you well structured how can you divide the data into well structured how can you divide the data into multiple tables if you store everything in a one single table it will become a very complex now I'm saying divide the tables into multiple tables logically in a meaningful way in a well structured way now now if you see that I've taken a four tables here users table movies table and watch history rating ratings table where each and every table have a specific purpose and it is storing the pro user table is storing the profiles and subscription related information and the movies table is uh storing the title and journal and duration and watch history is storing the uh each users watches what are the movies he's watching and when he's watching right and ratings it will hold the reviews of the uh customer users right these are the things you already know right now see here each table is having a specific category and specific purpose right what happens if you organize the data properly into the multiple tables see here right netflix come to know what are your actually the interest area of interest in in terms of movies right what genre of movies that you like based on that it will personalize personalized way in a personalized way it will recommend right suppose let's say now you are watching one movie in the middle you left like that and tomorrow at some point of time you wanted to watch the movie same movie again so if you don't if they don't monitor properly then how can you play the same video from that point of time right so proper management of data is required so if you have a proper tables properly so instead of searching entire database you can go to that particular table and you can quickly access the information right that is what I'm saying here all right now see here that whatever we have discussed earlier right you already have a little bit of idea now now I am saying in a more technical way let us observe let us observe carefully right now see here now you wanted to store the Netflix movie uh database like I mean like um you wanted to store the Netflix activity of the user right simple database consider Netflix database with a sim uh small set of scenario about the watching the movie and if you see here we have 16 columns each column is representing the different data types based on it it's it rule business rule If you see here till sixth column sixth row it will be storing the different category of data I can say now 7th to 12th it is storing the different category of data and then if you see 13 and 14 it is storing the different category of data and 15 16 similarly different category of data right what first to six it is about users data and next right 7th to 12th it is storing the you can say movies related information and then 13 14 it is a watch history 15 16 it is a rating related data right to help you further let me add colors to the data this metadata I can say this is a metadata Understand this is a meta data now see here when you when the use there is a chance that one user may watch multiple movies right one user may watch multiple movies right when the when the business is growing when the more and more movies are coming more and more web serieses are coming right then definitely database data in the database will grow exponentially right so you can't manage each and everything in a one single table because of lot of problems will be there in previous slides we have seen right there is a lot of problem maintenance will become very very difficult so that is why that is why you see the database providing option to you store the data in a divide that one table this particular table into multiple tables and store properly so that in the next time when you want to retrieve any data it will become easy when you want to modify it will become easy right now suppose let's say now you've given rating to the one of the movie at later point of time you understood that um you wanted to change the rating right if the data is if the data is like in the millions or billions Then how can you retrieve very quickly how can you modify the data very quickly right it is very very difficult right yes exactly but that is the reason now see here I divided the tables into different cate different multiple tables and I'm storing for each category I'm storing the data separately and I'm and I'm also created some relationship between the tables so that if I wanted to get the data of the users users watch history then what I will do I will combine the tables of the users movies and movies watch history Right isn't it right so it is also providing the facility to write the complex logics also easily if you do even if even after dividing the table but still we are able to get the data properly by using the giants right easy right similarly if you wanted to get the ratings of the one particular user and one particular movie right is simple just join the table accordingly you don't need to uh right take each and everything Right very simple i've just divided the one table into multiple tables in a well organized way right now next terminology in the database definition is what do you mean by the structured collection what do you mean by structured collection now in the business organization you know that every time if you talk about the one particular user then um right so he's having a lot of entities related to lot of properties related to him that you need to store right are you getting what I'm saying how can you structure the how can you store the collection of data it is not that one user right now one users related Movies related information watch related information now you are storing right that is fine now like that there are so many users are there how can you store them previously we have seen that is I'm connecting again here see here there you are saying that you are dividing the tables into multiple one single table into multiple tables again right but here whenever you are storing the data for each and every table understand carefully each and every table you have a predefined rules predefined business rules you can't store a integer data in the in the column of worker string related data type okay are you getting each and every column is having some certain rule right see what what I'm saying here structured collection right structured collection means data is stored in a predefined format predefined format means here anything it may be table if you take if you take about the relational databases it may be the document if you take about the nosql database right and now we will confine ourself here to relational databases now I'm saying data is stored in a predefined format right containing such as rows and columns inside the table right and we have defined some certain rules for for the table to store the data it is not like whatever the way that you wanted you can store no every table every column is having the specific business rule right so what kind of data you are storing in each column is a matter so that is what structured collection right you are storing the lot of data right so you are grouping everything and putting into the one place while storing the data you have to store properly otherwise it will throw an error okay so that is what I'm telling right each and every column have a specific data type it may be text it may be number it may be uh integer it may be date it may be time stamp sometime yeah yeah these are the simple things each row you will say uh record what do you mean by the structure collection how it helps that is what uh this is this point it helps in in terms of ensuring the data consistency and easily you can query when you have a proper structured uh table with the data right what do you mean by the data consistency let me tell you again suppose let's say there is a table you are storing the integer numbers you are supposed to store the integer number but what happens if somebody comes and try to store the um string some text data or maybe some date it will create a data inconsistency right according to the business rule according to the rule you have to store the integer data but if you store the some other format of data then what will happen data inconsistency will lose right so that is why before itself so database is pro database is designed in such a way that it must ensure data consistency now you understood in terms of while storing the whenever you wanted to store the integer data you have to store integer data only you are not supposed to store any kind of other data other format data and maybe date it may be text it may be image or anything simple right let us take an example of Netflix right now I I'm saying you are storing the data in the form of the table table format containing rows and columns i have taken one sample record now you are see here so when you have a table data in a table format in terms of rows and columns and retrieving the data will become very easy querying becomes very easy okay now if you wanted to get the data retrieve the data of movies in the genre of sci having the more than 2 hours right so if you use the filter conditions like this properly then it will become easier for you to get the data even if you if your database is having a huge amount of data but still because of you divided the tables in a proper structured way then querying is becoming very easy and lot of problems you provided right if you consider about the traditional way of data storing database is the very very easier one right and it will provide lot of facilities lot of features right let's see here yeah that is what I'm saying right querying becomes very easy yeah the second point if you see prevents the sum someone from entering the two hours in the duration columns that means it doesn't allow you to lose data consistency at any at any cost because duration is in the duration column you are supposed to store only integer numbers right you are not allowed to store any kind of names or any any kind of other other format of data it must be a number it makes you the more easier to query the data right when you properly organize when you properly give the structured way right now how how it helps you in Netflix right see here so if you organize that is what right so if you organize properly then it will become very easier for the even for the Netflix also to recommend you based on the interest rate and also you can use a lot of filters it will optimize your page your uh landing page very properly based on your interest right now we have seen what two points right two terminologies what is that one is about the well organized and in a structured collection structured collection because table is having some predefined structure with a pre defined some defined with the rules business rules right now very very important thing is next one is what is the meaning of the logically interrelated data very very important right now you have seen we have divided the single table into mult multiple tables right if you see that if you remember that year diagram then we have used we have um there are some lines of there connecting the one table to another table is that is there right that is the relationship between the tables yeah so how it how you are connecting the multiple tables now you are saying there is a one table which is storing the business data so later you understood that maintaining is the single table for entire business is very very difficult now for that reason you have divided very very structured way right there are some people who already know about the normalization so many other thing is that there right so please try to concentrate on the point here you don't get into the normalization and everything now concentrate on this particular part only so only definitions and terminologies so I'm slowly slowly introducing the terminologies because in a later point of time it will become very very easy for you right the logically interrelated data Means so different tables in the tables are connected through the some relationships different tables in the database are connected through the relationships what kind of relationships it may be the primary key foreign key uh relationship through the primary key and foreign key relationships okay right so if you connect logically to multiple tables then what happens you can get the data you can retrieve the data from the multiple table at a time using the join conditions and data security will be there data integrity will be there it will avoid the unnecessary duplication of the data are you getting so all these points again again again and again it will come that is why I'm introducing the terminology starting itself starting initial classes try to focus on terminology you may be sometimes some people may not be belong to computer science so we wanted to cover each and every person that is why we are introducing the terminology in a very very detailed way we don't want to finish as soon as possible no so we wanted to give the more in-depth knowledge to you it is not only getting the job after getting the job how can you survive in the industry for a longer time if you know the subject then it will become very easy for you to work there right so in in your recordings maybe whenever you attending the gate classes this is a five minutes maybe one one or two minutes definition right what is mean by the data and what is you mean by the information what is mean by the database database DBMS definitions and but now if you observe carefully so for one data and information itself we have taken one special session completely practically if you have not watched please watch it is available in the platform if you are watching in YouTube it will be available there in the playlist please try to understand in a more depth practical right now see here this is a logical connection this logical collection allows you combine and filter the data across the multiple tables that means when you when you have divided the tables into multiple tables but whenever you are getting whenever you wanted to get the data retrieve the data from the multiple tables using the join concepts you are writing the query and you are producing the result to your client or your manager right all right what is the next thing example try to understand the example now you have seen that every table is having a different different purpose right so how they are interrelated that is my point here right I'll show you again diagram then you will understand carefully or maybe I'll show you the diagram practically by executing some queries I will also try to execute the queries if possible now see here there is a table there is a table watch history contains contains user ID column right watch history dot user ID try to understand watch history is the table in the table there is a column called user ID is linked to the users table user ID right users is the table dot user ID is the column name okay that is a primary key are you getting similarly in the watch history table again there is a column called movie ID which is linked to the movies tables movie ID column right similarly rating in rating column rating table there is a column called user ID and movie ID which is linked to the users and movies tables respectively right so this is what interrelated means that is linking between the tables but how it is linked using the concept called the integrity constraints constraint is a set of rules i hope you understood the all these three terminologies properly well organized that means you are dividing the proper tables when you want to store the data you are dividing the data into category wise and you are dividing storing into the respective tables the structured way whenever you are wanted to store the data so you should not store as whatever the way that you wanted for everything everything is some business rule is defined accordingly you have to store the data in the database so that it will become very easy in future for whatever the activity that you wanted to perform right yes when you when the tables are linked many tables are linked then what what will happen so if you want to write any complex business logic then it will become very Easy because everything is segregated in proper way you just need to use proper SQL concepts you have to pull the data that means retrieve the data see here how how if you organize the tables in a proper way if you interrelate the tables in a proper way then what happens how it helps to the Netflix that is what that is what I have written few points here it will track what you watched if you go to the movies history then you can that is that is actually tracking the watch watch watch history of the table users right and anyway using the watch history it will recommend you recommend you to the the jer of the movie that you wanted and it will prevent the duplication of the uh records unnecessarily right yes very very important Point D is so suppose let's say if you want to recommend something because you watch the previously some Jonah related movies continuously so then based on that watch history it will recommend you the movies right and in the middle of the somewhere in the movie you stopped somewhere and you wanted to continue the movie how can it support you because it stored the data properly in organized way Right if the relationships are not there properly so it is really really difficult to right provide the services to you user I mean right to the [Music] user right now see here so same points again I'm repeating again so terminology try to understand because again and again we are going to see the same terminology same same concepts right advantage of well organized and structure shelled collection of data so if the data is very if you organize in a very proper way then what happens you can quickly access the information then it will easy to manage okay there is a very less scope of the mistakes okay are you getting me just a second right when the business is growing when the when the data is grow grows like anything in the data in the database then even after that also you can handle very easily but if it is a single table then it is very very difficult right and think about the file system the traditional way of storing data very very difficult right very very complex to handle and you have a centralized control over the database in terms of security in terms of backup and recovery if you if you define the proper rules to the database database tables the data is very Clean data is very clean and very much consistent right the same thing about the logically inter related data then maybe you can go through this one so otherwise it will become the same concept again and again right right that's all about today's lecture so I hope you understood what you mean by that database definition very clearly right what do you mean by well organized what do you mean by the structured collection what do you mean by the inter logically interrelated data so whenever you are learning something please don't read and don't read without understanding practically think what is happening in the background because computer science is all about logically logical thinking only right so if you want notes if you want notes and road maps and so many practice questions so we are going to post on these particular groups you can scan and you can join to the groups while scanning be careful it is about only groups related in groups for for the purpose of learning don't post any other things right and also before going let me uh yeah let me complete so whatever you are learning please try to post it in the LinkedIn and tag us we will monitor you how what is your thinking process and what you are expecting from from us and whenever we give any assignments to you please give a solutions there and try to tag us we will try to verify you your answers right and if you have any questions and clarifications concerns then you can reach out to us so before closing the lecture let Let me tell you let me show you the year diagram practically okay are you able to see this one right now see here so I have a tables right see I have created a structure for the tables whatever we have discussed in the class about the users okay about the users I showed this is the data and the movies and then watch history and then ratings we will see one by one okay see I'm I'm going here and Then okay let me see the movies related information control enter now see you you can see here right so movie ID title Joner release year and rating right similarly let me see the users related data also now we can see here user ID name email and subscription whether it is a premium or basic or standard uh subscription and then uh join date okay all right now what is the next thing select star from movies we have seen in now we will see watch right you can see here history ID also generated okay that is a unique primary key yes and user ID is there movie ID is there watch date that means you're tracking your history users history based on this only they will kind of produce the recommendations by joining with some other tables right movies tables select star from rating see here rating for rating also rating ID is generated can you see this one everything is very very properly organized user ID is there for that user ID what is the movie ID that is watching and what is the rating that is given are you getting now see here carefully now there's one concept that I didn't cover so far so whenever you are saying it is very very organized uh you are storing the data in a very very organized way in the form of table okay and every table is having some certain kind of rules tools right so now how can you see the uh the see here so this is the meta data of the table try to understand this is a meta data of the table what do you mean by metadata it is the details about your tables this detailed description about your table we are going to see anyway this concept in a very detailed way for now just try to understand but because we are seeing everything practically right so we're trying to understand everything clearly now see here column name is there okay and the type of the column is there and constraints are also there constraint related information one more important thing and one of the interview question also one of the interview ask me so how do you know the when the table is created in the database can you tell me can you tell me when this particular table is created table creation date right table creation date okay now see this one i think now you are able to see everything right clearly there may be chance that um some of you might not have seen properly because of the width is very huge for this one let me adjust properly okay anyway uh now see here now here you can see the constraints related information also right so you can see primary constraints and if there is any foreign key foreign key also it will come here now here for the users you can see here diagram related to the only user category how it link to the other tables right and then in the movies table movies also here you can see the year diagram I just want to show this year diagram uh specific to the table that is why I'm showing everything to you okay so okay this much is for today's lecture And tomorrow's lecture maybe the next lecture we will see uh more about the so what are the ideal features of the database management system okay just a second All right so now in the next lecture we will see more more of about the some other things in the database management system and then uh we will enter into the uh next important topics okay what do you mean by exactly uh database application what exactly the meaning of the database application what are the different types of databases available in the market we will see uh a few categories try to understand and then u we will see database man database developer life cycle okay database life cycle then we will introduce the Oracle database to you and then we will start working on the practical part try to understand in the course the first initial few classes are more of theory and we will try to build a strong foundation in a practical way and then we will try to enter into the more practicals completely practical that meaning so in the course 30% is the theory and 70% is the practical because you need to understand you need to understand how can you provide the business solutions to the uh organizations it is not about the learning the theory using the theoretical knowledge using that subject then how can you create a database application how can you help your project in the project in a proper way right that is the important thing okay thank you guys thank you so

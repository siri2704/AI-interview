welcome back to code Symphony unring the code Mysteries I'm your host banin and today we are diving into one of the most debated topics in the world of database management SQL versus nosql it's a classic dilemma that every developer and database administrator faces at some point in their career [Music] let's start with SQL or structured query language which has been the backbone of relational database for decades SQL databases are all about structure they uses predefined schemas meaning the data is stored and organized into tables with specific rows and columns this structure is what gives SQL their strength in handling complex queries and ensuring data consistency SQL databases are also known for it adhering to AET properties that are atomicity consistency isolation and durability this makes them reliable for transactions especially in environments where data Integrity is crucial some popular SQL databases you might be familiar with include MySQL post gr SQL sqlite and Microsoft SQL Server each of these databases has its own strengths from mysql's widespread use in web application to post gr sql's Advanced features and standard compliance [Music] now let's turn our attention to nosql which stands for not only SQL nosql databases emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional relational databases particularly when it comes to handling large volume of unstructured or semi-structured data one of the key advantages of no SQL database is their schema design which allows for greater flexibility unlike SQL databases you don't need to Define the structure of data in advance this makes no SQL ideal for situations where the data model might change over time no SQL databases also excel in horizontal scalability instead of scaling up by upgrading Hardware no SQL databases scale out by adding more servers this is particularly beneficial for Big Data applications and system with high traffic popular new SQL databases include mongodb which is document oriented and highly scalable Cassandra known for his high avability and F tolerance redish an ink memory key Value Store often used for caching and Ne 4G a graph database optimized for handling complex [Music] relationships so how do you choose between SQL and nosql it really depends on your project specific need if your data is highly structured and relational SQL databases might be the best fit on other end if you are dealing with unstructured or famous structur data new SQL offers the flexibility You Need scalability is Another consideration for applications that require horizontal scalability and can handle large volumes of data no SQL is far better choice however if consistency and transaction Integrity are your top priorities SQL databases might be the way to go let's not forget the use cases SQL databases are commonly used in financial systems Enterprise applications and other environments where complex queries and data consistencies are Cru no SQL on other hand shines in big data analytics content management systems and applications with Dynamic data [Music] models the choice between SQL and nosql is not one size fits for all decision it requires a deep understanding of your project requirement the structure of your data and your scalability needs by carefully evaluating these factors you can make an informed choice that align with your goals and ensure optimal [Music] performances thank you for tuning in to this episode of Code Symphony unring the code Mysteries I burhanudin and I hope this discussion will help you navigate the SQL versus nosql debate with confidence join me next time as we continue to unravel more coding Mysteries

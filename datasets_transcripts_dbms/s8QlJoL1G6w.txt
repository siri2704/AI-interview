Hello friends! Welcome to Gate Smashers The topic is  Serializability If we talk about transactions topic in database Then in that the most important topic  That is serializability And specially those who are doing Gate and UGC-Net preparation Or who are preparing for other competitive exams Those people specially Don't leave this topic at all Because from here There are maximum chances of the question to come And the topic is very simple Actually what is the meaning of serializability? Serializable Means, What a schedule has a ability to become a serializable Means I am given a schedule What is a schedule Collection of transactions Means I have lot of transactions After gathering them a schedule is formed That schedule Can I make serializable? Can I make that schedule serial This is the topic So if I talk There is a schedule In which there are 2 transactions T1 and T2 There are 2 transactions in schedule T1 and T2 And if in T1 I write Let's say read(A) write(A) Read(A) Write(A) If I write it in this way Then this schedule Just from the diagram you have to check That do you think this is parallel or serial schedule This is serial schedule Because in this T1 will get over first After that T2 will start And it will finish Means if we represent this in a graphical way Then how can we make in the graph We have to make its processing Means, how many transactions are there? 2 T1 and T2 So  I have made 2 vertices First of all which started? T1 And which finished? T1 After that we went on which? When T1 got completed Then we move to T2 So I can denote it in this way So we have made a simple precedence graph Of this serial schedule And what is the meaning of this serial schedule That T1 will be completed Then after that T2 will be completed We can write this in one more way If I say That there are 2 transactions T1 and T2 It can also happen that first T1 will be finished And after that First T2 will finish And after that T1 Now see What is the schedule by seeing Serial or parallel? Again this schedule by seeing It is looking serial only And in actual this is serial schedule only So serial schedule means First T2 completed Then after that T1 So if I represent this T1 And T2 But, T2 completed first After that T1 got completed So if you want you can see it like this Or you see it like this Which schedule are this both? serial schedule Because in this first transaction is executing and completing And after that Second transaction is starting In middle there is no interleaving So  this schedules can be done serializable What is the need to do them serializable? It is already serial schedule This is also serial And this is also serial So the serial schedule cannot be done serializable It is already serial What  will always be given in the question Parallel schedule Means, you will be given in this way That one T1 is there And one T2 is there There are 2 transactions In a schedule Read(A) Let's say Read(A) Write(A) Write(A) This T1 and T2 Read(A) Read(A) write(A) Read(A) Now what is this schedule by seeing? It is serial or parallel? It is a parallel schedule Reason, if we make its graph So from where did it start? T1 We went from T1 On T2 So we started from T1 We went on T2 And we completed T2 a bit Read(A) write(A) We again came on what? We came on T1 So over here a loop is created Whenever parallel schedule will be given then what will be created over there Loop Now after seeing this question After seeing this complete schedule You have to find out That is this schedule is serializable or not It is serializable or not What is the meaning to find serializable or not If I tell you in simple language Then this parallel schedule We have to find a clone Means finds one clone That should be serializable It should be a serial schedule So if we want to convert this into serial schedule Then how we will do it We have 2 ways to convert into serial schedule Either this parallel schedule Convert it to T1 goes to T2 Or Convert it to T2 goes to T1 Means, if this write(A) I write it over here So this will be T1 goes to T2 Or if I write read(A) write(A) over here Or I can write read(A) and write(A) above And write read(A) below Then what will this become? T2 goes to T1 So this is a parallel schedule To check parallel schedule as serializable What you have to check That what equivalent to this Equivalent to this Does any serial schedule exists or not So that concept we say serializability And for serializability there are 2 ways One is conflict serializable And another is view serializable Conflict serializable and view serializable You can use conflict serializable method With that we will come to know that Can we make serializable schedule of this or not And one is view serializable method We will use these both methods And in any parallel schedule We will check That can it be serializable or it cannot be made So first point you always remember Whenever serializability will be given Any question will be given You will never be given serial schedule Always you will be given Parallel schedule And equivalent to that parallel schedule You have to find out a serial schedule So what can that serial schedule be Like T1 goes to T2 Or T2 goes to T1 If there are 2 transactions If we talk that there are 3 transactions Let's say  That we have a schedule S In that there are 3 transactions T1, T2 and T3 T1, T2 and T3 Now T1, T2 and T3 What will be given parallel Let's say Read(A) Read(A) Write(A) Write (A) Let's say read(B) Write(B) Write(B) Anything In this way some parallel schedule will be given This parallel schedule Which is looking parallel by seeing This is looking parallel Can we do it serializable or not Means what I have to find equivalent to this? I have to find serial schedule So for that we use these both methods So if we will make this serial Then what possibility we have? What is the meaning of making serial That first T1 Then T2 And then T3 Or first T1 Then T3 Then T2 Or T2  T3 T1 Or T2 T1 T3 Or T3 T1 T2 An last is T3 T2  and T1 So these are 6 possibilities Out of these 6 possibility If I convert this schedule And bring in one possibility Then we can say that yes it is serializable Why did this 6 values come? Because 3 values are there Over here we have 3 transactions So 3! you have to find out So what is 3!? 6 So we have these 6 possibility Out of these 6 If you bring equivalent to any one Means by seeing this looks parallel But if we want to make it serial Then from these 6 possibilities we will have to make any possibility as true So to do that We have 2 methods Conflict and View So over here I just wanted to give you over view That what is serializability Simple always remember That serializability means One parallel schedule is there You have to find a clone That should be serial That is the point You have to find a clone of parallel That should be serial How to do it That we will check in next video Thank you

[Music] good morning students in this video we will discuss about the properties of B plus tree okay they have given all this P you can ask me that self in B plus tree we have an order for incremental and order for the leaf not separately okay if they have given only one order the milk should consider the order of internal nodes is equal to P and the order of leaf nodes is also P okay if the order is P then the root node okay will consists of minimum to children's and maximum P children's okay if the order is 3 then root node will have two children two maximum three children's and the number of keys a rubric and consists of minimum is 1 and maximum is P minus 1 okay if P values 3 then it will have minimum one key maximum it will have to kiss okay whereas if internal no it will have a P by 2 of sealed function is the minimum number of chamber and Maximus P children's so if your p value is 3 for example it will be 3 by 2 to 3 childrens what is 3 by 2 which is 2 so 2 is the children's children Sandman is the three children's you will have okay and what about the kissed - because the number of children's if you see the no structure of Indian or the leaf node spectrum you have the clock pointed key block pointer key block pointer where block point we can say that it is a change okay so if you have three chains you will have only two keys so if you have P by two children's then you will have P by 2 minus 1 keys is the minimum and maximum is P minus 1 is so you will have 1 to 2 keys because it is heavy too so you will have one key and it has to reach FX at maximum so you will have match me two keys and the listener also will consist of V by 2 minus one piece leave nor do not touch this of any children's okay what is the structure of an if not the leaf normally consists of t record pointer P key record pointer P T record pointer P then at last we will have a block pointer which is useful to connect to the simply okay so it will have minimum P by 2 minus 1 keys and maximum P minus 1 kiss then you can ask myself it will have only P number of keys max while you are subtracting 1 is that you have a block for internal also so you need to subtract 1 for this block pointer so at max you can have P minus 1 keys and minimum you will have P by 2 minus 1 keys so if you substitute the p value you will get 1 is the minimum keys and match them you will get to kiss okay I hope you have understood the properties of B plus trees I have discussed the root property internal node property and leaf node property with an example ok thank you so much

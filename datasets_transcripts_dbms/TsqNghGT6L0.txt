hi everyone welcome to this channel again and today we are here with the second tutorial of sql as you know yesterday we have started a new series in structured query language so let's get started so now basically today we learn about what are the basic operations performed on the database so here are four basic operations performed on database that is create or insert read or retrieve update or modified and delete and draw or here we also can remember such operations as a short form credit so if you are not able to learn all the four steps so you can learn it as a short form that is cred so crud are the basic operation performed on database so now second one is what is dbms are you know about dbms if yes so please uh comment below what do you understand by the dbms basically dbms stands for database management system database is only a software which is used to maintain and manage the data into database okay so basically data is stored in the database so what are the method in which software which helps to manage the data and maintain the data so that is dbms it is also provide two important factors first is security and second authorization if you are using a database software so definitely it will it will improve the security level and authorization security means you know that no one will can access your id your data and anything which is yours okay and authorization means if you have your credentials so that doesn't mean anyone can hack your uh hike your idea anything else which you are using so basically database management system helps to prevent it from the hacking also so basically here you have to learn two things first of all if you want to connect with or communicate with the database then you should know the query language check and if you want to communicate with the rdbms that is database manual system that you have to know about the structured query language so this is the basic difference between the query language and the structured query language so here we have our next slide now do you know about rdbms so basically rdbms is stand for relational database management system rda dbms is a type of dbms software which helps to arrange and store the data into tabular format or table format the two basic difference between the database management system and relational database management system is that that rdbms give the all the data and stored and arrange all the data into tabular format if any database management system is follow rdbms or relational database management system that's mean all the data will arrange into the tabular format so rdbms also provides two important factors that is security and authorization note this is very important for you all we use standard query language that is sql to communicate with the rdbms that means relational database management system and second one is query language that is used to communicate with the dbms so here our next topic is relational model what do you mean by relation model basically relational model is a concept which was designed by the data scientist ef cord with the help of relational model concept data will be stored in the tabular format that's it this is the relational model a basic node that is a database software which allows to follow the relational model is uh arrange or maintain all the data into tabular format next one is table table is a logical organization of data which consists of row and columns table is consist of rows and columns where rows also refer as the records or tuples and second columns also referred as attributes or fields so next topic is what is row column and cell a basic definition of row column and cell are row is also referred as records and tuples a row is used to represent that all the properties of single entity second one is column column is also referred as attribute or fails a column is used to represent one property to all the entity and last one is cell sal is the smallest unit in the table in which we store the data basically intersection of row and column generator cell so this is here all about the tables data database rdbms and dbms so guys this is all about for the today session okay so if you have any query and doubt so feel free to contact me you can contact me through the social media as i give all the links in the description and also you can comment in the below comment section okay in this uh tutorial now i will provide only those things only these things which is very useful for you and showed your definition and i want to give you all the stuff which i give the best from the internet and all so grab this opportunity learn points to point by which you will build your capabilities and learning skills so thanks a lot keep sharing the video stay safe goodbye

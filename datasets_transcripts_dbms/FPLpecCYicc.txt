hey everyone and welcome back to another video we are already in the month of April believe it or not yes it's been a very very volatile start of the year although the first month and a half or so were fine then from midFebruary up until well right now turbulence lots of turbulence so fasten your seat belt although maybe April 2nd things might change now as you know these types of videos we're going to talk about four stocks we already talked about those four stocks quite a lot because I own some of these names and in this video specifically I actually own all of these names now just

watching this well when I release it this was basically what has happened on Monday on Monday the market actually closed well most of these companies as you can see most of them turned green we started the day very very red and then we've made our way back up i think the S&P closed green though was green the NASDAQ was almost break even but look at this plenty of green although yeah some of the big tech companies were still red you know my thoughts on what's going to happen after April 2nd i still stand by it now let's see if it plays out all right so company number one I want to touch on is this one right here i believe this is the first time I touch on Door Dash on the channel it's a market cap of 76.7 billion and over the last 5 years as you can see right now it's still down 3.6% over the last 3 years it's up 56% and over the last 12 months it's up 32% and even year to date it is still doing quite well so why is it still on the list well be because it is a very very good company actually now you will see the trailing PE 638 alarm bells but no no if you look at the PE for the next 12 months that's already at 38.6 if you look at revenue forward growth here two years 19.5% EPS same period 52.3% very very rapid growth and you will see what will happen actually with free cash flow as well now all of this information of course can be found on Finchad stock research platform probably the best one right now copilot you can ask it questions just like you're asking Perplexity Gemini Chat GPT Grock you can ask it questions about specific companies such as Door Dash Uber you name it and it will give you the answers the comments the transcript sections and all of that in the copilot and of course as I've shown you many many times in these videos you can of course look at segments and KPIs one of their strengths of the platform is that they track company specific metrics in this case segments and KPIs for Door Dash you can look at the annual ones or you can look at quarterly of course the majority of the revenue does come from the United States but they have they have been growing internationally rapidly as well i believe they also acquired a company called Walt so that's one of the strategies there we're going to talk a little bit more about that but as you can see growth for United States revenue has been well quite something since 2018 it has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 79.3% and of course internationally much smaller but that has also grown extremely rapidly so these are one of the things that you can find here on Finchad you can look at marketplace monthly activives door dash pass and world plus members total orders and all of that this is just for Door Dash of course we have been talking about plenty of these companies and all of them have company specific metrics that we can track that you can find on Finch Chat so if you want to try it out again link down in the description below new users get two weeks for free of Finch Chat Pro and if you want to upgrade use the link you get 15% off you support yourself and you support yours truly Mua so thank you very much continuing here average analyst price target sits 20% higher than the price we're at today for Door Dash if we look at the PE now here of course when you're not profitable then there is no E so that's why it's a bit strange right now but it's pretty clear that from a forward PE perspective even if this stock is up in the last 12 months and even the last 3 years you can see that well PEOS pricing metrics it is getting better and better same thing here for price to free cash flow price to sales and EV to Ebida all trending in the right direction yeah of course for some this might still be very expensive but if we look at free cash flow growth or the expected free cash flow growth for the next coming years fiscal year 2025 17.8% growth then 33.7% year-over-year growth and then a bit closer to 30% in fiscal 2027 so in my eyes a very very good company that's becoming more and more profitable and as we've just seen generating the majority of its revenue in the United States but they are expanding internationally and total orders total orders have also increased quite rapidly over the last couple of years then if we look at marketplace gross order volume that has also gone up quite rapidly over the last couple of years although yeah growth rates year-over-year are coming down but last year that was still at 20.2% year-over-year growth now yes I'm sure you've already seen plenty of memes right door Dash and Clar I believe have partnered up so whenever you're going to order your burrito or taco or whatnot um you you can you can basically pay in for look at some financing options when you order lunch yes that's a bit ridiculous but hey optionality and then the last thing here just looking at gross profit margin profile and free cash flow margin wise free cash flow margin as you've seen this keeps on increasing gross profit margin has stabilized a little bit now a bit closer to that 50% mark moving on to one of my personal favorites and that's of course PayPal or PayPal now as you can see PayPal over the last 5 years the stock is down 31% now of course 5 years ago we have started that V-shaped recovery from that pandemic crash but yeah 5 years down 31% even in the last 3 years that's still down 43% and in the trading 12 months performance it's uh it's basically flat year-to date we are down well 24% now PayPal at the moment has a market cap of $64.4 4 billion trailing PE 16.3 forward PE 12.9 ridiculously cheap you know my opinion on PayPal it has become one of the largest holdings in my portfolio because riskreward-wise to me it's just a no-brainer although more recently there are plenty of no-brainers so hopefully we have a brain to take the opportunity and buy quality companies for the long run and so looking at the average analyst price target for PayPal that sits 34% higher than the price we're at today pe compared to the well in this case almost 10-year mean is well more than half so more than half than the 10-year mean here quite ridiculous if we look at what's expected to happen and this is basically the story here cuz previously previously of course revenue wise we were growing faster than today but look at something that did not grow free cash flow so you grow revenue faster usually usually if you have the same free cash flow margin or maybe free cash flow margin increases free cash flow has to go up that was not the case very bad now yeah revenue is not growing as fast as before but at least now we're having some growth when it comes to free cash flow which will enable them to just buy back more shares buy well quite a lot of shares which in the long run will be extremely good for shareholders and yeah maybe in the long run they might pay a dividend although right now I do not want to hear the word dividend not for PayPal not for Amazon not for anyone to be honest buyback first and then maybe in the future dividend if we look at transaction revenue this as well over the last what 10 plus years has grown at the company annual growth rate of 15.7% of course huge jump has happened 2020 to 2021 then growth did decelerate quite drastically but in 2024 we did see a small reaceleration can that continue remains to be seen i trust Alex Chris active accounts same thing here we have peaked in 2022 but it does seem like we are going to have a new all-time highs when it comes to active accounts starting maybe in Q1 and this basically pops that bare case that people keep throwing around in my comment section that nobody uses PayPal anymore only boomers etc etc well again the data does not lie plus plus if you really know PayPal then you know that PayPal owns Venmo venmo is extremely popular with the younger generation so with Venmo there is also monetization strategies i've talked about the whole new PayPal one strategy in another video that will be in the top right corner but I'm quite tired of hearing nobody uses PayPal anymore now clearly clearly a lot of people are using PayPal are using PayPal services are using Venmo etc etc when in doubt just look at the data and then zooming out we look at gross profit margin that has come down since 2019 and then the peak here 2021 so that wasn't great but again in 2024 we did see it rebound a little bit i hope and I think we're going to see that continue in 2025 free cash flow margin same thing here that has come down from that 25% back in 2020 to just 14.2% in 2023 but look at this 2024 we're back here 21.3% one extra thing here specifically with PayPal look at this total employees peaked here in 2021 since then that has come down quite drastically and of course now revenue per employee goes up this is going to be a leaner business doing more with less becoming more and more profitable great business to own riskreward-wise probably one of the best moving on to one of my most recent buys and that's Nebus Group now Nebus Group right now trades at $21.11 has a market cap of $5.2 billion now Nebus Group got relisted on the NASDAQ late last year so whatever you're going to see on various stock research platforms even Finch I did message them to try and update those figures but there are a lot of figures that are just outdated because remember it's not Yandex anymore there has been a huge huge restructuring there so it's very important that we go and look at the last earnings report the earnings call and look at the very much up todate data very important to note now since they got realisted of course the stock did do very very well it went up I think to $50 or so and since then well since then it has uh come down quite a lot and so in my eyes a huge buying opportunity if you like these types of companies now usually I'll just skip this because there are only two analysts covering this company at the moment and I think that with Core Wolf's IPO more people will start looking towards a Nebus that's just my prediction so right now just these two analyst these two predictions here average analyst price target sits 160% higher than the price we're at today do with that information what you want don't take it serious to be honest now going back to last quarter in Q4 the group's revenue was $37.9 million that increased $466% yearonear driven primarily by the core AI infrastructure business which grew 62% yearonear adjusted Ebida loss in Q4 was $75.5 million and net loss from continuing operations was $136.6 million for a full year the group's revenue was 117.5 million an increase of $462% year on year plenty of cash still or so from that raise where Excel and Nvidia did invest in that company now this is the important part because I've seen a lot of comments of people saying "Oh how can you invest in this business they barely generate any revenue etc etc." Again huge restructuring but look at what's going to happen in the coming quarters in Q4 we also focused on building out our sales function and we are now seeing the results more clients are coming onto the platform and our more diversified customer base is already contributing to strong growth in ARR based on contracts already in place March ARR will be at least $220 million and we have additional potential deals in the pipeline given this momentum as well as the anticipated impact of additional data center capacity and Blackwell GPUs coming on stream later this year I'm pleased to confirm that our projected December 2025 ARR of 750 to a billion dollars is well within reach you see how fast things can change so don't be looking at just this small number right here no start focusing up on this one and the potential of a billion dollars in ARR by the end of 2025 that's when things get extremely interesting and they are growing quite rapidly whether it's in Europe or in the United States they're expanding quite quickly look their business is basically this right now what you're buying is the core business Nebus AIcentric cloud platform built for intensive AI and machine learning workloads featuring both owned and collocation data center capacity with ongoing expansion then you've got these ones right here tooka AVID10 triple 10 is an adtech platform avid is the autonomous driving technology for self-driving cars and delivery robots and to loca that is a data partner for all stages of AI development from training to evaluation basically a source of data labeling then they also have a 28% stake in Click House the creator of the popular open-source column oriented DBMS now they say that these are the competitive advantages that differentiate them from other players i'm not going to read all of them but basically it's this full stack with expertise across the whole AI infrastructure value chain so they've got 20 to 25% lower total cost of GPU ownership and operations compared to the average GPU provider they also said the following and they basically list they basically list their competitors right GPU clouds such as core weave paper space lambda or hyperscalers here Oracle cloud Azure Google cloud Amazon cloud they say here the reasons why or what's their competitive advantage so if we do the GPU cloud for example coreweave nebus offers more flexibility than GPU clouds in regards to GPU consumption and has a broader service offering fueled by a larger development team when it comes to the hyperscalers Nebus provides tailored approach for AI developers and businesses including including SMBs size customers now they say that the hyperscalers yes that they're going to take probably the majority of the market but a lot of it will be for in-house use internal use a Nebuse a Nebus can offer something different now the thing with Nebulus is that well for them to be huge success it has to continue to move extremely quickly to expand as fast as possible and to offer the lowest cost per GPU unit that's basically it to be honest i mean Yandex was worth I think in 2021 $30 billion or so a pretty huge company in Europe yes a Russian one but that's the team that's the expertise that you have here in that small company called Nebus today and then the last one is Google Alphabet i I just had to put it yet again despite me doing a video specifically about Google I think two three days ago it has to be in this video yet again because in my opinion this is one of the big tech players alongside with Amazon i think Amazon as well under $200 an absolute no-brainer alphabet is just very very much disrespected market cap $1.89 trillion dollars forward PE 17.2 times even the trailing PE here at 19.2 times makes absolutely no sense now like I said I've already talked about that company in the last video so here's a quick overview average analyst price target is 40% higher than the price we're at today if we look at the forward PE 17.1 or 17.2 two times compared to the 5-year mean here of 23.19 it's it's an absolute joke now you might say "Yeah but that's because search is under pressure." Okay let me show you yet again first of all free cash flow is expected to accelerate in the coming years so there is that second of all if we look at what has happened even with capex increasing that much or expected to increase free cash flow is actually expected to accelerate in the coming fiscal years yes in the past we have seen what has happened here in the past you can see capex basically increasing quite quite rapidly but free cash flow margin has been around 20% or so with gross profit margin actually increasing over the last couple of years now talking about the well nobody uses search Google search anymore first of all that's not true and if that were true you would see that impacted in the revenue in the operating income and in the overall Google business currently I see no indications of that happening plus I don't know if you've used Google in the last couple of days probably you have but you see that when you search something you have AI overviews yes basically you get an answer already in the first box ai enabled you want to know why because they have Gemini gemini 2.5 Pro is right now benchmark-wise the rankings it's the best of the best currently things can change quite rapidly but to tell me that oh nobody uses Google anymore they're behind in the AI chat GPT takes their lunch etc etc currently I don't think that's happening and yes it's true GPT has been growing extremely rapidly also thanks to the new image generating well feature who knew that this is what you had to do right forget about spending so much or releasing I don't know things that can change well someone's jeans or whatn not no just release an image generator that makes you look like an anime character that would attract millions of users of course and then let's say if if Google search does get hit a little bit I think there are some other segments inside their business that are going to continue to grow nicely one of them is of course Google Cloud google Cloud is going to grow quite considerably in the next couple of years and this is becoming a more and more profitable business for the company youtube same thing here i believe an analyst at Mo Nathansson said that YouTube alone could be worth $500 billion he's applying a 10 times price to sales ratio when you look at the revenue for the whole of 2024 so yeah when you have these types of companies inside of Google then long-term bets a way more a way more for sure can be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the future last time that we checked 4550 billion in valuation I believe as they launch more and more in the United States and in Tokyo this in my opinion in the future will just be a huge huge IPO that's just my prediction here and so yes Google I think is a no-brainer and I will keep repeating the same names again and again if they stay cheap because it is a huge opportunity it is a huge opportunity bare markets don't happen so often so when they happen take the opportunity i know it's a crazy thing to say right we have way more bull markets or bullish years than bearish ones so when you have a bearish ones take the opportunity to start adding to very very good businesses at depleted prices because that's that's when that's when you get a lot a lot of amazing returns 2022 March 2020 trade war 2018 I mean of course 0809 but I was still in high school by then but these types of events that's usually when you make a lot of money the money for investors is being made in bare markets but you only feel that during a bull markets or you only take the profits during bull markets so enough of me i think this video is way too long apologies for that but uh it is what it is share your thoughts what are you buying in the month of April let me know down in the comment section below hit all the buttons check fin chat take it all and I'll see you all in the next one bye-bye [Music]

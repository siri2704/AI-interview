as we all know database is one of the most used concept for any company so all the company has their own database and they have to manage that so we have uh we have to know lots of concepts we have under database management system and here we came up with the proper end-to-end project where we are going to do our hr database management system and we will look how hr database management can system can be handled and what are the things we can do with this database right so in this tutorial we are going to cover how to uh use a ancient database management system what are the data manipulation you can go for and what are the expected query you can think about the age or database management system so before start the tutorial let me introduce that great learning has come up with the idea that is great learning academy where you will get almost 80 plus free courses and after complete your course you can claim your certificate as well and if you want to do this courses in a mobile application that is also possible using great learning app so let's get start with the tutorial now in this part we are going to talk about the project tool that is aged database management system right that human resource database management system so let's go to mysql workbench and let's have a look at how we can do that so here we came here and we are going to make our database right so here is our table ci is our uh like the all the data and all those things right so here maybe we are going to make one database right uh so making our database we need to write create database human resource use human resource right let me just execute this so yeah so it's you can see it's your human resource database is created now i am going to use that particular one yes that is also done now we are going to create a table whatever we are going to create we are going to create a table called countries so there you can see i have written create table if not exist but the thing is like if uh as it's a new data database you don't need to write this right so what we are going to do you can see create table countries the name of the table is country then your attribute will be country id country name region id now country id will be back at the combination of character and the numbers then the country id link will be two as we know that country id length is like normally we have that is 2 now that after that i have written one condition what condition i have written that will be not null so what is that mean we all know about what is not null it cannot be empty if you give it empty it will give you throw your error right i said my country id cannot be null it's not null okay now what we need to do we have second attribute called country name that is also vacant the length of the worker is 40 right and default is null the fault is now basically if you don't put anything then it will be null right region id if you put the region id right there there will be a region id for uh the basis of region that will be decimal and yes that can be decimal and that will also be default null if you don't give region id then we have primary key so we all know the concepts of primary key how primary key works what is the use of primary key for a recap primary key is basically just to reduce the redundancy of the data and helps to helps in relational database management systems as well our primary key is country id and if you see that key counter region fk is equals to region id right and this engine part if you can if you want to just say no i don't want it you can do that now if you go and check if your table is created or no uh like write show tables right so i just want to check this country's table is created or not the country table is created now i just want to add all the country details our country id is ar country name is argentina region id is 2 right so let me just add the value to the country table okay okay this much we have okay for that let me just execute this yes it got executed now if you see select star so we have used select star from countries right can you see your all the data are uh stored in the table called countries right now we are going to make the next table the table name is departments how this gonna i think if you do if you want to recheck it that the same even name table is there or not that time if not exist right so create table department let's have a look at the attributes we have we have department id that will be decimal again not none default is zero right you can add both of them it cannot be null if you don't give it so default will be zero department name that will be welcome the link will be 30 and that will be also not null manage your id your manager id cannot be null uh yes no your manager id can be null that it is a simple one the type of manager id will be decimal and the default is null if you don't give anything the default will be null then the location id for location id will be default will be null so if you look at closely so we are using two one is not null and default zero for department id so it can used uh twice i mean these two together right now primary key is like department id okay and the other key we have that department id and depart manager id and location key right these are the other keys we have if we can um execute this let me just execute this yes it's got executed right now what we are going to do it's giving me error why because of this okay now i want to again do show tables execute that yeah can you see the department is also there now i will put all the data to department so we have department id department name manager id and location id so if you look at it we are not gonna use insert into so many times what we have done we have written insert into departments the table name then all the columns you want to fill right then if you write values and if you give 10 20 sets of values you can directly execute them right so this is the easy way to insert value in mysql again right let me just execute this okay it's executed now if i write select star from table name was departments can you see your all the data got dumped or you can say all the data got saved in your table right so department id 10 department name administration manager id 200 location id 1700 right now we are going to make one more table that is called employee table so in the employee table we are going to write create table employee then employee id will be your attribute that will be decimal six comma zero not null default zero first name is vector and that is also default null then we have last name that is also where that cannot be null so this is not null then comes email email cannot be not null so that is why it is not null and again it's a bank ad then we have phone number okay lots of list like a big list we have we have phone number that will be where cad that will be that can be null right higher date date that type of the higher date or the type of the attribute higher it will be date that can be not none um job id that will be vaca 10 that will again not null then salary salary is default is null this will be decimal obviously and the default will be null now commission pct then this will be decimal and default is null then we have manager id that will be also default is null then we have department id that is default null now if you can see primary key will be employee id as normal unique key so we have two three four unique keys in one table but primary key cannot be more than one so unique that employee email id will be email id will be unique key right and other key will be this these are the other keys right let me just execute this part [Music] right we have executed now if we want to check the table the show table part show table so we will see how many tables we have created so far it is created or not right so this show tables you can see employee is there now we will add the data this will be the most big data if i'm not wrong [Music] right can you see we have inserted all the data now if you want to check you can write select star from where from employee right so let's start from employees and you see all the data got saved in the table the employee id 100 first name is steven last name is king then again uh email is skin okay email is just so one word okay job id add praise salary 24 000 commission pieces 0.00 right so this is how we are going to use this table and these are the attributes we are going to have in employee table as we have my three table let's have a look at the next table we have the table will be job history so create table job history then there we will have few attributes like employee id start date indeed so employee id will be decimal type start date will be date type and it will be date type that the both will be not null then job id will be not null then you will have department id right then you will have primary key employee id and start date this two will be your primary key right now key will be this and this is how we are going to make the table that job history will have two attributes and that to attribute will be primary key right yes now we will gonna insert all of them the insert the value of all of them right for job history table right let me just execute this now if you want to check it is already there or not again we are doing the same procedure select um start from job history can you see you got employee id start date indeed job id and department id now we are going to talk about the next table we have the table called jobs in the jobs table we will have the attribute called job id that will be vaca not null default is uh in the quotation then job title that will be vaca not null minimum salary and max salary right so default will be null okay that will be type of decimal and the primary key will be job id so you can find the job using job id me just execute this yeah it got executed now if we want to insert the data to jobs lots of types of jobs are there let me just execute this as well and now we are going to write select star from jobs yes so your job id is at place uh job title is precedent minimum salary is 20 000 maximum salary is 40 000. then adv then adssd fi mgr finance manager then fi account accountant right then accounting manager that the minimum salary is eight thousand two hundred sixteen thousand will be your math salary right now we are going to talk about the table called location so we have written create table then if not exist then the table name will be location and the attributes we have we have location id street address uh postal code right okay we have ct all of them are like location id will be decimal street address will be vaca postal code will be very care the default is null right all of them default is null for location id default is 0 because otherwise it will be not null so what is the use of using not null and default 0 together so the reason is basically if you are not giving the data for this particular uh attribute that time it will automatically zero take zero as otherwise it will not give you any error right so you have postal code cd state province country id right because some of them have default null some of the art just default zero then primary key location id then we have few keys and yes this is what we have for this table the location let me execute the location table yes it got executed now we will add the data yes inserted into this is all done now we will do the same thing just to recheck that all the data is inserted or not we are going to write select star from locations let me execute that yes this uh you can see these are the data we have we have we are cola drive right lots of street address we have we have posted code 989 cd roma venice tokyo like south lake and all okay now we are going to make a table called region that and we will have region id read your name and the primary key will be regen id union cuny key will be read your name let me just do that and let me just insert that as well region one so do that what we need to do we need to write select star from [Music] what regions right and we will make the uh er diagram for this as well for the reverse engineering then we will solve the um exercise for this particular database okay so to the reverse engineering what you need to do go to database click on reverse engineer then what you need to do you just need to click on next right uh now you to give your password for my case one two three four five six seven eight right now if you click on next you need to uh select the database for my case it is human resource then next then next can execute then next and then finish right these are the table we have made and what are the can you change that they see the difference this symbols as we have given right primary key if you got primary key you will get the primary key right okay so this is the er diagram we get got for this particular database right so this is how we are going to do that now we are going to do few queries to solve the problems and if you use show tables these are the tables you will have right so these are the table we have created according to and based on that we are going to use or we are going to solve our uh database map like sql um you know assignment is based on this database now we are doing the demo for this database right so now we are going to talk about how we can use the or manipulate or face the data using this hr database right so first what we will do we will first start with uh use hr okay so as we know we have already uh do the show like as we know already we have created the table we have already inserted the data now we will see what the tables we have in our database so if you can look at here you can see we have country table we have department table we have employable job history jobs and location all right so now what we will do the first let's have a look at what the first question is gonna say you to do that they are going to say write a query to display the names the first name and the last name using live's name you need to give a list for them that is the first name and the last name so what you need to write you will get this information in the employee table can you see we have the employee table over here now we will say hey select first name that first name as the alliance will be first name then last name last name as the last name alliance will be last name right from employees if we can uh execute this uh can you see we got alienable sunder and a right the first name and the last name so let's have a look at if we don't give the alliance what we will get then suppose we are going to write select then we are going to write first name uh comma last name from where from employees right let me execute this yes can you see we got first name and the last name only the attribute name we have it's gonna give you that but if we add these alliance what we will get we will give this column name as first name but allies who give and the last name so already we have talked so many times about these allies and yes this is something you need to uh like remind that why do we need now we are going to see the second part right the second question we have they are going to ask you write a query to get unique department id from employee table right so you need to get all the department id that should be in a distinct one right all the unique department id not the repeated one so as we know if we need to use a unique part or unique data from a particular column that time we need to use like a keyword that's known as distinct right so now we are going to write select distinct department id from employees right so first we will do this without these things and then i will show you if we put the extent what we will get right so if we write this and if we just execute this part so let's have a look at what we will get we get 10 20 20 30 30 can you see there is a repetition of the department id over here now as the question asks you to give a you know distinct one the unique one for that we are going to put this keyword let me execute that can you see over here now we don't have any repeated value so we have 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 and 100 train right so this is how this distinct keyword works right now what we are going to do we are going to talk about the third query we have so here what we are going to do they are asking you to write a query to get all employee details from employee table order by first name in descending right so what you need to do as we know we know the concepts of order by right so here we are going to use order by concepts in a descending order so as we know order by basically used to you know like making your data in ascending order descending order so we are going to write select star from employees we are using start to fetch all the data from the table so select star from employees or a buy but you have to put order by with the according to the first name so you say first name and dsp because of descending order in default order by giving ascending order results right let me just execute this part yes if you can look over here can you see winston william vance valley uh taylor susan is there and lastly we will have adam alana so let me just show you if you don't do dsc what you will uh get your result what it will do the order by can you see in the like in default like the default what the order by is gonna give you adam elena alberto alexander right so if you put bbsc it's basically you are saying to your order by clause hey i want my or like data i want my data in a descending order right now we are going to talk about the fourth question we are asking you write a query to get the names the first name last name salary pf of all the employees but pf is not there you have to calculate the pf so pf is calculated as 15 of salary right how to do that to make a new uh column what you need to write you need to write select first name last name the salary now you know as the salaries of 0.15 percent sorry not 0.15 percent the 15 percent right so you will need to write 0.15 as you convert it to percentage right so 0.15 as pf from employees so you can do the calculation directly in your query as well can you see you got your pf as well the first name is steven last name is king salary is 24 000. the pf is 3600 right so this is how your pf will be calculated the 15 of pf now we are going to talk about the write a query to get the employee id name first name last name salary in ascending order of salary right let's have a look at how to do that so as we as they said ascending order of salary what it will give you it will first uh give you in ascending order so you need to use order by so what they are otherwise what are the columns they have asked for they say employee id so you need to write select employee id first name last name salary from employees order by what order by your salary column right so as they have already said you have to have the uh result in ascending order you need to you don't need to write dsc because you need to uh have that order like the salary or your data in ascending order right let me just execute this part can you see over here your salary is in the descending order first twenty one hundred then twenty two hundred then twenty two hundred twenty four hundred and keep on write this right twenty four thousand seventeen thousand fourteen thousand thirty and then five hundred so you have said i want my salary in a ascending order now we will jump into the sixth question what they have asked for write a query to get the total salary payable to employees right so you will give this to employee table but they have saved total salary as you want to have the total salary you need to like sum all the salaries so what you need to write select sum of salary as employee uh from employee right i want to give a lies for that um total salary maybe right let me just execute this okay you need to write this okay you cannot give two different what as allies for that you have to like link them with this okay so i as i say total salary your total uh salary for the company for all the employees it's six nine one four double zero right yes now if we jump into the sixth uh seven number question what they are asking you basically write a query to get the maximum and minimum salary from employees table right so you have to put the maximum salary and the minimum salary so getting the maximum and the minimum salary what do we need to do we need to use two function one is max function one is mean function as we know this function are already predefined in sql so if you execute that you will get the max salary you will get the minimum salary so if i want to put a life over there then as max salary and this will be as mean salary right okay now if you execute that you will get a column name of max salary and minimum salary so you can see max salary is 24 000 minimum salary is 2100 right now if we uh jump into the eighth question that write a query to get the average salary and the number of employees in the employee table right so you need to have the average salary and count of total employee right so what you need to do right average the function predefined function avg that is for calculating average and then you have to put the column name that is salary after that you have put down the count star by counsel star will fetch all the data and it will count all the data as well so average and count star so average will be your as uh average salary of all employee and this will be as count total count of employee total count right yeah now if we can execute this part can you see uh we got average for salary is six four six one and total count is one zero seven okay so this is how our average mean max these functions works these are the predefined functions as we know and it actually makes our lives easy to do all this pro process right uh for count also we have this predefined function there are lots of predefined function as we discussed earlier there are lots of predefined functions we do have and please we also want to know how you feel about the tutorial please do let us know in the comment section and like we are like great learning has come up with the brilliant idea that is great learning academy uh then you will get almost 80 plus free courses and after complete your course you can claim your certificate as well uh so please guys try to make use of this opportunity as much as you can try to skill up yourself and get certified from great learning that is also for free of cost and yes please do let us know in the comment section what you feel about this particular tutorial and what else you also want to learn from us right so now let's jump into the next query we have write a query to get the number of employees working with the company right so again if you want to see how many employees working with the company you need to just use the count function as we already did that over here that is one zero seven so if we just execute this part we will get again one zero seven so total number of employee right uh the number of employees working with the company so if you want to make this as the lies can you do that let me just try to do this yes i think you can yes you got this that the total number of employees working with the uh company right now we are going to talk about the 10th query write a query to give the number of jobs available in the employee table okay if you want to see how many types of jobs you have you need to do something again if you need to do that and again if you just look at this question quietly i mean if you look at the question is in a very close way can you see they have given you two condition to get a number of jobs right you need to give the number of jobs is available and that should be distinct right that should be not in a repeated manner okay how to do that so in order to do that you need to write select you have to use two function one is count that will give you the count and the distance function is basically for giving you the unique id right unique job id so in that case and from employee table if we execute that can you see we have 19 so if we don't use this count let's have a look at don't use this uh distinct letter look at how many uh total job id we have so here i am just removing this distinct part so you will understand the work of distinct right okay i got a area because i have okay can you see the total job id we have that is one zero seven that is obvious that we have one zero seven employees they will have different different job id and there will be a repetitions but here i want all the unique type of job id and that's why i have used distinct function right okay now we will move into that 11 number query what we have now we will have a look at that now here we are going to uh look at the 11th query write a query gives all first name from employee tables in uppercase okay that's interesting we need to get all the like first name in order to in the upper case how to do that if you need to write select then we are again going to use a function called upper function that will make your all the first name in uppercase from employees right let me just execute this can you see you got all the name aliens on the uh david hermann hermann shelley everyone in the upper case now we are going to talk about the 12th one write a query to get the first three character of first name from employee table okay so first name uh first three character of the first link so you don't want the all uh first name for all the employees you just want three character as we used before we are going to use substring function here we need to give three parameters for this function one from which column you want to use the substring second from which one like from which index you want to cut down your string and the ending like the starting and the ending one so i want from first to tell third one right so select substring first name then one from one to three from employees if we just execute that can you see ell sun moss dav she we got if you say i want till four so it will give you first four character of the full like uh first four character of the uh first name right so ali sand devi harm shell can you see yes so this is how it works right so if you use substring be careful what are the uh letter you want in your uh data when it's gonna return now we if we look at the 13 query they have asked you to write a query to calculate 171 into 214 plus 625 it's very easy to do that so if you can do that selects 171 into two one four plus six two five as results let me just do that can you see three seven two one nine it's there it's your result now we are going to talk about the fourteens uh fourteen query what they have asked you write a query to get the names for example ellen abel sunder andre etc of all employees from employee table okay so what you have to do you need to they give up or like format that in that format you have to have your data so in that case you need to use some functions what function should we use we can use concat how so this first name and last name both are not uh both are two different column right so we need to merge them not even merging them we need to format them in a proper format they have given how to do that that time we need to use a function called concat function so here we have written select contact under that we have given the column name first name then as they want a space between them the space being the last name that will be uh like the allies will be employee name from employees so this is how we use concat function and this contact function help us to format our text the way we want right can you see ellen abdul sundar and a mozi uh acting son right david elstein we have got this name in a proper format now we will talk about the 15 question what we have write a query to get first name from employee table after removing white spaces from both side okay we need to uh remove the ball like if we have any white spaces we need to remove that so again we have a function for that it's always give us a you know using my sql is so cool and you know it's actually reduce your work because we had like they have lots of like predefined function that will help you to solve your work right so select stream first name from employees so we are going to use stream function the stream function helps to cut down all the white spaces so if we do that can you see you get alien sunder moosie david harman sally okay so i don't think you can see this white spaces we had in the our database but if you have any white space in your uh database or in your data like you know in your database that time it will help you to cut down those you know white spaces now we will jump into the succinct query write a query to give the length of the employee names the first name and the last name from employee table okay it's it's really uh a good one so if you can look at it like if you can look at it how can you do that so first you need to write select first name last name then we are going to use one function the function called wind function and we are going to give you the give the who the column we want to go for the first name column plus the length of last name you will get the length of full name so in length of names as length of means this will be the allies from employees if we do that and let me execute this can you see other first name is alienable so one two three four five six seven eight nine so you got the length of the name is nine then soon that one day one two three four five six seven eight nine ten this is the length of the name is stain yes this is how this length uh function works now we will jump into the 17 question let's have a look at what we have uh write a query to check if the first name fields of the employee table contains number okay so how to check that so checking that what we need to do that we need to write what they have asked you write a query to check if the first name fields of employee contains number so containing number what you need to check you need to use rejects so rejects we have used for you know checking the numbers if you have or not so we have written select star from employees where you are giving a condition where the first name range range x p i e g e x p that will contain from where from the range you are giving 0 to 9 okay so this is where it's going to check okay is there any number is there in your first name or not if we click if we just execute this yes we don't have any employee name uh that is uh you know where the first name is basically with the consistency of any rejects or any number now if we go further if we look at the 18 question then we have write a query to select first in records from the table okay now it's really a good one how to do that for stain records right that time we are going to use one more uh keyword that is limit right we are going to use limit so here we have written select employee id and the first name from employee if i as i want this and the limit 10 when you have written this limit in that time your query is understanding okay this person wants what this person want the select first 10 records from a table that will be tame right so if you look at here you can see can you see this you have stefan nina lex alexander bruce debit right and you are using limit over here okay so this is why we use limit to give the limit at what limit you want your data you just want to face the data from where from the table now we are going to jump into the 19 question as it's a little big question and there is a notice as well there so they're asking write a query to get monthly salary round two decimal places of each and every employee okay right assume the salary field provides the annual salary information okay so as we have the salary occur like column there you can assume that column is providing you the annual salary so now you need to break them into the monthly one how to do that you need to write select as they want the first name last name then you have to use a round function because you don't want uh like after decimal like you know getting a number uh in decimal uh after like after decimal you want only two value will be there not more than that that time what you need to do you need to say salary divided by 12 the second parameter you are providing at what point of the decimal number you want that after decimal i want two numbers that's why i say i have written two as monthly salary okay from employees if we execute this one let's see what we will get yes we get uh two thousand one four one six can you see the monthly salary and after decimal always you get two numbers right not more than that this is why we use wrong function now if we jump into the one more query that is write a query to display the name that is first name and last name and salary for all employees whose salary is not in the range of dollar ten thousand though in a dollar fifteen thousand right uh so basically what you need to do as they say this dollar so in that case as it's not mentioned it's in inr or in dollar we can assume this is in dollar what you need to write select first name last name salary depend uh department id from employees where you are giving the condition where salary not between ten thousand and fifteen right they have asked you the salary in not between 000 to 15 000 okay you have to give that i have given one more uh condition that's not required as they don't uh specify that if we just execute this part can you see the department id this the salary is 24 000 17 000 9000 right but not between um okay uh they have written ten thousand and fifteen thousand right yes so it's not between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it's above that or under that okay so you got twenty four thousand seventeen thousand seventeen thousand right now thousand but it's not from ten thousand to fifteen thousand okay now if you jump into the next query what they have asked you write a query to display the name the first name last name and the department id of all employees in a department uh 30 or or 100 in ascending order okay right so what they have asked you the department id will be in the uh in 30 200 and uh that will be in order by you know assigned ascending order so if you want to add ac you can otherwise if you can leave it over like this it will automatically take it as a ascending order so whatever quality will be select first name last name department id from where from employee table where department id in can you see it's in 3200 as they say the department id will be between um in 30 and 100. so you have written department id in 1300 and then order by what department id so if we execute the whole thing what we will get can you see we get the department id and uh 100 100 100 100 right so in 30 and 100 only you have the department id 3800 and that tool will be in ascending order right can you see 31st and then 100 okay now if we jump into the third one then we they have asked you write a query to display the name the first name last name and the salary for all employees salary is not in range uh 10 000 and 15 000 are in department 30 and or 100 okay so yes here you will get two uh query right one query uh no not query it we will get two condition one condition salary between ten thousand to fifteen thousand not between thousand and fifteen thousand and the department id will be only 30 and 100. so we have written a query called select first name last name salary department id from employees where salary not between 3000 and 15 000 and department id in 13 and 100 we have done uh this separately now we are merging them to merge them we are going to use a keyword that is and can you see they have to have both that they have to qualify both the condition you have given then only you will get that data this is your condition the whole condition each and every row needs to maintain can you see you got it the salary is three one zero zero department id is 30 and they are not in between 10 000 and 15 000 and the department id in 30 or 100 right now we will jump into the fourth one okay what they have asked write the question to display the name first name last name and hired it of for all employees who were hired in 1987 okay so in this case i did not write the code okay so in that case if i want to see select star from employees the hiring late will be there okay so what we have we have job id salary a commission pct department id and a higher date right so you need to get this you know 1987. can you see the hyatt who were hired in 1987. so first let me just try to do that select start from employees where higher date is opposed to uh you need to do what year of fired it if we use the function called year of higher date is equals to 1987 let's see what you will get can you see the year we got for 1987 only yes so if you want to get only the year right how to do that okay okay uh so basically it's under comment okay it cannot be executed so if we execute this part right can you see you got it the higher end date okay so yes so if you give that the year of it equals to 1987 you get all the higher date that is 1987. so what it will do it will only extract the year from higher date and it will match it okay if the higher date equals to 1987 if it's there then it will change that right uh now let me put this again in comment so if you need to do comment you can see this is how you need to use the comment one right so the fifth question is asking about write a query to display the first name of all employees who have both b and c in their first name okay now i need to check who have b and c in their first name how to do that select first name from employee where first name like we use the pattern matching so what you need to have you need to check if b there in their name so in that case uh percentage anything can be before b b and after percentage anything can be after b and one more later that is and first name again like before percentage uh c like the percentage before c it's basically any word or any uh character can be there before c and after c also there will be after c also there will be uh lots of or any alpha bits will be there right so if the b and c is there in the first name then only it will return all the record so only bruce can you see only bruce has b and c so this is how this like or pattern matching works so like is basically used for pattern matching if you try to find it out one particular letter is there or not if it's there then you can use like function as we talked about the like function now we will have a look at this next question we have most probably this uh okay right we almost came to the last part of this uh query solving part right and please do let me know and do let us know basically in the comment do you like this project or not because we are trying to give you a proper intuitive idea that how this sql works how you can to solve the query and yeah how can you start your career in sql as well right so now we will look at the 6th query that write a query to display the last name job and salary for all employees whose job is that of a programmer or a shipping clerk and whose salary is not equals to okay dollar four five zero zero or eighteen thousand or fifteen thousand okay there are lots of conditions we have but okay we know how to deal with this right so break it first first right select last name job id and salary these three fields you know it need then from where from the table employee then you need to write job id you have they have said job id can be it programmer or sh clerk right you have written that now the salary not in you don't want the salary will be in this so salary not in four five double zero or ten thousand or fifteen thousand right if you execute that uh let's have a look at the like you know the uh results we have that hanold id programmer salary nine thousand austin i.t programmer salary 4800 then bull ice h clark four one double zero then cardinals s h clark three thousand right yes your conditions are working and whenever you put and don't forget this and is basically you have to the query have two other data have to maintain both the conditions right now if we look at the seven query what we have write a query to display the last name of employees whose name have exactly six characters right okay so now we need to check if the name has exactly six characters or not okay how to do that uh okay let's have a look at how we are going to do this okay so select class name from employees we have written one two three four five six one two three four five six one two three four five six can you look at this okay so i will show you how we are going to do that we have written select last name i am just removing this why select last name from employees where last name like again we are using like for the pattern matching then they have said exactly six character you have to use uh this uh for exactly for six times one two three four five six can you see i have a print is this uh a particular sign for such time right yes this is how we are going to use right now if we execute that the same result we will get can you see austin this ubisot curvio maybe if i can put one more okay so in that let's see what we will get can you see this d hun uh then he he gives then kocher we have this parts right so exactly if you want six one you have to use this particular sign for six times this is how this like or pattern matching works now we will talk about write a query to display the last number of employees having e as the third character right so if you want to get is at the third character can you see i will put this underscore for two times or if you say exactly as the third character right so two and then e will be third character after that anything can be there okay so if you want to say i want this particularly at this particular point that time you have to use this particular sign okay so we have written select last name from employee where last name like the underscore e percentage to underscore and then e percentage can you see abel bayer chain ever ever ate fiend c affinity uh flew all right they have the exactly e in the third position in their name in their last name basically right now we will talk about the ninth one okay we have fifth to five to six query left let's do it as uh like quickly and just complete this project right so they have asked you right away to display job or designation available in the employee table again we have done this so distinct job id from employees right now we have one more query this is done we have done this pf calculation before as well now now we have a new one write a query to select all records from employees well last name in blake scott king fraud right and uh how can you do that you need to use in basically select star all the data from employees will last name in john's black scott keen or ford right so you want all the last name should be in between this otherwise no you don't want the data can you see john's king king you have you don't have uh scott or fraud right okay this is how this works now if you want to use the aggregate function and group by how to do that right away to list the number of jobs available in the employee table so yes we have done this count and distance again uh if we look at this uh already we have done this total salary payable for the employees and the last one we have the minimum salary obviously we have done this select mean salary from employees it will give you the minimum salary from your employee table right to one double zero in this video we have looked about how can you start with the hr database management system and how can you create your table how can you do the data manipulation how can you feed your data and also how can you insert your data and lot more we have learned in this tutorial please do let us know what you

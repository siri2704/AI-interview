welcome to my YouTube channel for IND subscri right indexing okay so indexing indexing is used to quickly retrieve particular data from the database okay inding is used to quickly retrieve data from the datab DAT IND formally we can we can Define indexing as a technique that uses uh us sorry uses data structure to optimize the search time optimize the search time of datab index usually consist two columns colums which are a key value pair key value pair okay value okay so sear sear search key contains copy of primary key or candidate key primary keary okay so of database table generally we store selected primary or panded key in a sorted manner so that we can reduce the overall query time or search so search key okay right next dater data reference contains set of points that holds the address of dis block reference okay so the point data uh disk block contains the actual data reference to the to buy search primary index cluster index secondary index so primary index right so first primary index okay primary IND okay 2 ascending right so primary index 2 2 IND second Prim IND cluster index order not unique secondary index not primary index okay so if index is created on basis of primary key of the table then it is known as primary index so IND primary key are unique to show uh to each record and contains one to one relation between the record so primary right so unique and one by one relation okay so as primary key are stored in sorted so the performance of search operation is quite efficient soor so so IND IND contains index record for every search key value in a data file so search sorry okay so ites search F right in this the number of Records in index tables is same as number of Records in main table so main table any record IND right so it need it needs more space to store index records itself the index record have search key and a pointer to actual records of the index so index record search rights IND for every search every index keor every file right the number of records in index table is same as number of Records in a main table so index table IND right it need more space to store index record itself so index records have search key and pointer to the actual record so IND right so IND okay so SP IND in data file index records appears only for a few items few items okay each item point to a point to a block okay so in this instead of pointing to each record in main table index points to the record in main table in a gap so diag 2 for example sorry right right so in data file sorry in the data file index record appears only few items right each item point to block for example block okay so instead of pointing to each record in the main table the index point to the record in main table in a gap examp one main main right okay now clustering clustering IND cluster index can be defined as unorder data files sorry cluster index can be defined as order data file sorry sometimes index is created on non primary key columns which which may not which may not be unique for each record cluster index in this case to identify record faster we will group two or more column so two or more columns group together uniquely value create index out of them so com okay this method is called cluster index okay so records which have similar characteristics are grouped and index can be can be created for this group so for example so cluster IND cluster index can be defined as order data type okay so order data type some sometime the index can be created on non primary column which may not be unique for the each so one one one okay so for example number for example Department okay next secondary IND okay [Music] right so in secondary index to reduce the size of mapping so mapping SI another level of index is introduced so 1 to 10 10 to 15 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 right okay so in this method the huge range of range for the column is selected initially so that the mapping size of first level becomes smaller so first IND okay so then each range is further divided into small range so okay so mapping of first level is stored in primary memory so that the address switch is faster so primary memory first sorry primary index secondary level secondary memory okay so secondary level index right so secondary level and actual data can be stored in secondary memory right okay so first option second option mobile number mobor second right second second so for example primary IND 11 110 12 121 okay 121 200 right right so secondary secondary IND next IND secondary IND okay Gap gap for example 1 to 1 to okay but okay okay secondary right so friends thank you

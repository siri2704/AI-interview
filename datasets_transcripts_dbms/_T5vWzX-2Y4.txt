DT okay so actually there are two types of entities run the type MDT sex sustainable okay and it is with the physical existence and entities with the conceptual existence physical existence rely entities in the physical existence in layout the entities in the a linear and I think a number of organic conceptual existence mahaprabhu about physical existence all entities in example honor student live customer book etc other can run out of physical existence and they are their Sameach the entities without physical existence along entities with the conceptual existence nor ananda jana Sayle university causing you know to bank account these are examples of what and it is with the conceptual entities and conceptual existence so these are the two types of entities okay and now we have to discuss about attributes there are different types of attributes also about attribute Anora another entity or Die different properties on earth there are these kind of attributes symbol attribute composite attributes single valued attribute key attributes derived attributes and multivalued attributes okay no come first one is simple attribute attribute on over i'ma properties in ya know this you know okay our symbol attribute internal similar attribute is an attribute to which cannot be divided further a diadem a Wyndham divides GM Watauga Williams of divided I am but attributes in IANA in the aura another single attribute in them or another okay but I know he goes children this should end any attributes and only the attributes are on a roll number class age in the moon amend the attributes on a symbol attributes on your all number and number who will do subdivide amatulla class age look and on a single attribute on it it cannot be subdivided or we can say that they are atomic other than done an atomic am next one is single attribute next to oneness composite attribute okay composite attribute anova another composite attributes are made up of one or more single attribute on NOAA Delco there are simple attribute to Allah attributes in iana composite attribute ANOVA another in Oran Hollywood no Kiko student in attribute sound roll number and truss name okay whatever

attribute and angle one or more simple attributes and Megan done a composite attribute sauna okay next one is single valued attribute near to the symbol honor this is single valued this is single valued attribute in overall it can take only one value from for a given entity from men and DT set about in Dornan and then Avenue or valium operator cool well I mean it can have only one value one value that is called what that is called a single valued attribute examples are here c roll number morocco roll number and is a general rule date of birth or accorded a tow for $10 gender is also will take only one value so these are examples of single valued attributes okay next one is multi valued attribute multivalued attribute a multivalued attributes are those attributes which can take more than one value for a given entity from an entity set we didn't allow more than one value you cannot attribute senior Nando area in the OREA multi valued by the single valued in a opposite turn okay so multivariate attributes an example on a mobile number and email ad mobile number on Okuma Macario baraka different mobile numbers and of only kuru their mobile numbers and our email id or a condom cordially no resume the a.m. roll number of Caracas on the monitor in down low either the random in the animal T value donna either and one done a single value Donna okay multivalued attributes in a number the ER diagram a percentage a you know they eat double or the live a sheet on it double over the widget on my TV I would attribute single person do you know okay single a single valued on angular node or volume on trained out any adult Alana derived attribute what is derived attribute the rider attributes are those attributes which can be derived from the from other attributes or a

which can uniquely identify a pull or that can uniquely identify an entity or entity in a unique way to identify jmburton attribute jnana any key attribute Anunnaki is in appetito we will learn more about keys in the next video okay so Ariana types of types of attributes occur - amla entities in the type of virtue and other volcanic attribute in a typhoon petition next one is a relationship what is the relationship relationship Nora in the bar no connection between logical association among entities la that is called relationship and relationships are mapped with entities in various ways either rund entities anomaly and entities of the Malays I'm relationships in a and entities enamel enamel on the you know the relationship of Eric another la about your relationship over acting as a member different ways is America okay I mean yeah no no come that is called relationship degree relationship degree and or another that the degree of relationship is the number of participating entity types other order relationship Billy it's the entity participate is a even the linear and or a relationship degree in Orion that is the number of participating entity in a relationship or a relationship with a truck Etra entities in there are any uh no relationship to type one or another I based on that there are four relationship degrees that is unary binary ternary and Nuri okay about relationship degree in the holotype on holiday in our on our love and honor relationship degree in the vernal number of participating entity type so that every entity either a relationship Billy a nd

decimal or a child Domino Carnegie or the child or the child in or any child in a in the water about to loop or a to the mother mother I were to buying an earlier relationship son on the one-to-many relationship all right the mother noir on our table our instance in a child and over in the table electra instant so i had to burn angle even though to come relations would come I guess I mean child in over I know the table la hora instance in a modern soiree on the table or instant side to Muharram a in the emitter loop communicating but true that is one too many even though more to many honest there's a method ordinate and on a one-to-one Nana have a number I would I think more to over a relationship a good number to many relationship around a one to many who know this you know any understand that you may need to many honor in this many-to-many relationship a one entity set to a can be associated with more than one entity in be and vice versa 32 more assume I'm going to mean

I'm gonna go down are they about than a near a theory to nomicon DM item for Emmett okay we're booking it after all those wanna get a dowel oh say MOOC inning are they alternate or a order Allah reward a books and oh like where a author allowed bar books on the way your relationship any on a many-to-many relationship with no area about a many and instances from from this table book can participate with many instances fora in this table called the author and this kind of relationships is called many-to-many or meet has the many too many cardinality ratio about either on a mini too many cardinality about that's all about ER model other drama ER model no we're not topic and I'm gonna completely do about in the next video available this we will discuss about keys in DBMS I have the DBMS select key Sonora a topic honor any core analysis and that's all in this video thanks for

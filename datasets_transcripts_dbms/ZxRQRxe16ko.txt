hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channel I am RTI and I'm back with another lecture of the dbms series so in this particular video we would be starting with another data model that is relational model so without any further delay let's get started so we read about ER model in the last set of videos now here we would be knowing much more about the relational model now why we are knowing about all these models how it is helping us and why we should be knowing about relational model tables relation and much more things so what happens now you are given a requirement consider you are given a requirement that you have a banking system okay so now what you will do is you firstly you will draw the ER model for the banking system now secondly you will convert this ER model into relational model so in the ER model we basically deal with the visual representation and in the relational model we deal with the tabular representation and when we are done with the relational model we will choose a software using which we can insert all the datas do some manipulation on that datas or perform some crud operations so this is how the flow goes now in this particular video we are learning about relational model so what is relational model it is a way of organizing data into tables now what happens is can consider there is a banking system now for that banking system I have given a visual representation of that banking system using all the entities all the attributes now from that visual representation what I'm doing is I'm using that visual representation to convert it into into a Tabler format so basically conversion or organizing data into the form of tables is called as relational model now there are some terms which are mostly used in the relational model the first one is table which we called as relation in the relational model the second is row which we called as tle in the relational model the third is column which we called as attribute in relational model the fourth is record which is each row in a table the fifth one is domain which is the type of value an attribute can hold sixth one is degree which is the number of columns in a relation and seventh is cardinality which is the number of T let's understand from an example so this is a table now the table would be having some rows and some columns so the columns are called as attributes in the relational model the rows are called as tle and each row is called as record now the table itself is called as a relation now domain so consider that this is the attribute which is name now name can only have character values consider this is the attribute which is age so now age can only have integer values so we are giving the domains of both of the attributes now the sixth is the degree degree is the number of columns in a relation or attributes so you can count 1 2 three so the degree here is three and cardinality is the number of tles or the number of rows that is 1 2 and three so cardinality is also three in the ER model cardinality basically means the mapping constraint that was one to one one to many many to many and many to one relationship but in the relational model cardinality basically means the number of tles and degree basically means the number of columns now what is relational model all about so relational model is all about data being organized into tables establishing relationship between tables using foreign key as I explained earlier maintaining the data Integrity that set of rules should be there that uh if uh there is a attribute which is called as age in that attribute I shouldn't fill the Val is a BC so there should be some Integrity constant which should be present that there is a domain that is integer only integer values are accepted here if I insert other values apart from integer it will give me an error and then the fourth one is a flexible and efficient way to store data which is using the SQL and to retrieve data so these all four things combines gives us the information about relational model let's have a look on what all are the things we take care in the relational model so the first thing is maintaining the Integrity constraints like domain entity and referential integrity now consider that there is a table person now person is having attributes as name age and date of birth now there could be a possibility that someone inserts a wrong value in the age consider a BC so there are some Integrity constraints which make sure that we don't insert any data apart from the domain now the second is the value should be Atomic that can't be divided further so uh whenever we give the attributes or whenever we provide the attributes in the relation model that all the values should be Atomic it shouldn't be that I am giving a multivalued attribute in a table so if I'm giving a multivalued attribute consider that there is a username which is a multivalued attribute so while making the table I shouldn't give it as username what I can do is I making the table and here I'll give the user first name here I'll give the user second name or middle name and there I'll give the user last name and the then the other attributes which means that all the values should be Atomic that it can't be further divide now the third is each row must be unique and here the keys comes into picture that is candidate super and primary so about all these Integrity constraint and keys I've have discussed in the last lecture so you can go ahead and have a look on the last lectur and then come to this video so this was all about relational model in this particular video we would be seeing about how we can convert an ER model to relational model in the next video so if you're liking this series please hit the like button if you're someone who is new to my channel can go ahead and watch out the tech content first and then if you like you can go ahead and subscribe also if you're someone who is new to dbms can surely binge watch this series because it is very beginner friendly till then take care keep learning keep growing keep smiling bye all

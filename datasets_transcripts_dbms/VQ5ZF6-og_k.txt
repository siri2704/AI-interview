hello everyone in this video we will discuss about three schema architecture in the previous video we have already seen what are the three schemas now we will see how the three schemas that is logical schema physical schema and view schema participates in the three schema architecture so the three schema are logical schema physical schema and view schema that will participate in the three schema architecture so I have created this kind of figure now at the first level we have the external level or you can see that the view level so this is external level okay and here the schema that will be used will be external schema external or view schema and this is view one this is view 2 and this is View 3. now in the previous video we have seen what is the external level what is the external schema so external schema will describe the sub schemas like there will be an N number of sub schemas or you can say that n number of views of a particular database and that views will be the part of the database that will be given to the user that will be shown to the user based on their interest so here I have created this view one view to view three suppose this is the database and it's external in external schema there will be three view of this database now in the second layer second level will be the conceptual level or The Logical level this is a logical level and the schema used here will be the conceptual or logical schema now remember conceptual and logical is describing the same schema this is the alternate name only so conceptual schema you can also say that logical schema you can also say that so this is a logical level and here we have the conceptual schema now Suppose there will be a course table okay there will be a course table now how if schema will represent in the conceptual schema it represents the attributes that are associated with the conceptual table so Suppose there is course ID name and duration so this is the three attributes of the table course so that is house the schema will look like at The Logical level so it will describe how the data will going to be stored in these attributes as The Logical schema now the third one is the physical schema or the in like internal schema so the level will be called as internal level and this is the physical schema that will give you the idea about the physical storage of the data in the database so this is the internal level and this is the physical or internal schema so here in between the external level and The Logical level there will be external or conceptual mapping and in between the conceptual level and the physical level there will be conceptual and internal mapping so this is a three schema architecture we have already discussed about all the three schemas this is the architecture that how they are connected with each other so conceptual level will be in between the external level and the internal level so there comes the questions why we need the three schema architecture so the main objective of this architecture is to enable the users to access the data from the database with the personalized view while storing the underlying data in the database all the users should be able to access the same data according to their requirements according to their interest from the database so database will show only some part of datum that is stored in that database that is according to the requirement of the user if user wants to see the students details then only the students detail will be available to the user and not all the table that is stored in the database also the mean second objective of this architecture is separating the users from the database now here in this user will not worry about what is the implementation what is the physical implementation and internal workings of the database any information about the physical storage will not directly accessible to the user user can only say its data that he or she may be interested in and not all the informations like where my data is stored where their where their data is stored and how it is stored what is the relationship between his data and the others data these type of information will not be accessible to the users so that is something the objective of this three schema architecture and this comes into the picture for the database nowadays all the database will be based on this three schema architecture there will be the external level The Logical level and the internal level and the schema is also designed at these levels based on the overall schema of the database so that's all for the three scheme architecture we have already seen about the three schemas and how these are connected in the three schema architecture thank you

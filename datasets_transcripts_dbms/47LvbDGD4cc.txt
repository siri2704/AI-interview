Hello Friends, welcome to Gate Smashers The topic is Immediate Database modification In last video we have discussed about deferred database modification In case of immediate First important point is Immediate meaning means immediate means when we're doing modification in database actually difference it this only and if we talk about T1 transaction T1 read(A), reading A means read value from database A=A+100 W(A) meaning of W(A) value of A in local memory or shared memory or you can say in RAM its value is 200 In deferred when we change in database When we do commit After commit We save the changes but immediate meaning As soon as value in RAM is 200 At the same time value at database is 200 and lets say Read(B) Meaning of Read(B) means it read 200 value B=B+200 value will be 400 So when 400 came here so we'll save it here at the same time this is the concept of immediate Means the time we're writing in memory or RAM At the same time we'll same write in database, or hard disk at same time we're doing means here we're not waiting for commit that after commit we'll change in database before commit we do change in database this is the biggest change here in according to deferred Same if we talk about its log so transaction log will form T1 start, meaning transaction will identify that T1 starts lets say if we make log of this only T1,A,100,200 What is the meaning of this T1 worked on A variable old value of A was 100 and new value is 200 so see that A old value is 100 and the new value is 200 so same B old value was 200 and new value is 400 T1 commit Now in actual recovery manager if here system fails, lets say at this point if my system fails at this time So when recovery manager check this log then firstly it will check that does T1 started or committed T1 starts also and got commit also so if T1 starts and commit So what it will do in this case Redo Redo Redo meaning that all the latest value save that in database means recovery manager will never check value in hard disk it will only check transaction log So it checked in log that there is start and commit means new values that is 200 and 400 so save 200 and 400 in database and if it is already saved then by overwriting fix that value so 200 and 400 are in database value of A is 200 and B is 400 but if we make same case and in that we say that it doesn't commit, lets say it doesn't commit if here it doesn't commit obviously it is also not commit in transaction also, that’s why it do not commit here Now what will happen This is the B+200 this was the transaction and here if we talk about database In database A value is 100 and B value is 200 We did Read(A), A=A+100 and W(A) W(A) means here value of A will be 200 At same time in database also value of A is 200 B, B+200 W(B), value of B is 400 At the same time value of B will be 400 here commit is not there lets say before commit failure occur if failure occurs so what will happen in this case its log will now be like this it starts here, there is change in A and B but not committed So in this case what recovery manager will do it will check that it was start but not commit, it only started so in this case he will take decision Undo Meaning of Undo is that the old values save them But if you see carefully in database there is no old value present Old value was overwrite so that is 200 and 400 So in this we'll bring old value see in log old value are written so this is asked many times that in immediate we store both old and new value but in deferred we store only new value reason for that is when we do undo it means old values in database changed old values will get change in database that’s why that’s why Immediate database modification is know as Undo/Redo strategy mean in this there is undo also and redo also, both things are together but in deferred there is not redo, undo is not there So if we talk about this transaction if we talk about this log So T1 started also and commit also so if T1 start and commit both are happening In this case we'll redo T1 but if we talk about T2 T2 started but didn't commit So in this case we'll only undo T2 so that’s why this is Redo and this is undo So this is the difference between the Immediate modification and deferred modification, Thank you

now let us understand database design and er modeling database design is a collection of tasks which help us to design develop Implement and maintain the database so in case if we design the database properly it reduces a lot of cost because the changes need not be done at a later stage it improves data consistency and the cost effective measures are in place so that disk is disk space is not wasted we develop logical model and physical model now logical model is concentrated more on the requirements of the data and what are the other considerations from the end user and the physical database design is more about what physical features are used like what hardware and what software are getting used so why do we need a database design database design is the blueprint of how the data is going to be stored it gives us a clear idea of the behavior of the application and how the requests are to be processed it helps us to know the proper database design and if it is done properly it will meet the requirements of the user the processing time of the application is greatly reduced if the constraints of the database are properly implemented so initially the requirements are collected this could be function requirements and database requirements function requirements means the overall functionality and then there are database requirements so database requirements as in what data and data type is to be stored so that is requirements analysis Once We Gather that we move on to the next step that is we develop a conceptual design now conceptual design is done using high level conceptual data model that is something like er model and it is not concerned with what are going to be the implementation details uh it is just to make sure that we have understood the requirements properly the third step is logical design now logical design is using representation data model like in the form of tables so conceptual schema gets translated into the relational model so this can be done using representation data model which can be either relational Network hierarchical it all depends upon what data what dbms are we using and the last one is the physical design under physical design we given the internal details like internal storage structure access paths file organization

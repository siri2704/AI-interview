here in the top example we have a one a one to one an employee manages at most one department so right now you have employees one-to-one employee manages a department and a department is managed by one employee and this one is referring to at most so it's one to one employee manages Department department is managed by an employee but let's look at a one-to-many example if we look at a one-to-many example we have an employee can manage multiple properties and you also have a property in this case of course a property is only managed by at most one employee so this is an example of a one to many where properties managed by by at most one employee an employee manages multiple properties so it's one to many if we go to our other two cases now we have many to one instead of one to many many to one so faculty belong to one department and a department belongs to me well a faculty belong to one department and a department has many faculty so if you're in this scenario a faculty member can only belong to one department at most one department and a department has a lot of faculty in our last case of many to many we have a newspaper advertises many properties and a property can be advertised in many newspapers so you see as I'm reading this I'm doing like the singular the newspaper advertises many properties and then when I read it in the reverse I'm saying a property is advertised by many newspapers it could be zero it could be many um but you can do up to many newspapers if you have an ad that you'd like to place so this is the example between many to many and the example between many to many an example between um many to one and when we went back to our previous slide we had the one to one and the one to many

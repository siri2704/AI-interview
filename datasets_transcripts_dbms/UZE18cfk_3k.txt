hello everyone welcome back to my channel in this video we're going to understand the difference between Tsubaki and candidate key okay so let's understand this with an example so this is a students table it has student ID student name phone and a address and date of birth so super key is the set of attributes that can uniquely identify each row so let's say a super key is student ID and store name can store an audience through name together-together uniquely identify this entire row yes hence it is a super key it is super the the biggest one though okay so it may contain some extra attributes as you can say as you can see sorry as you can see surah name is yannick extra attribute occurs student ID alone can uniquely identify the entire row but student named as an is an extra attribute but super key may contain extra attributes okay so this is what super key is okay a set of attributes that can uniquely identify each row now what is candidate key candidate key is minimal set of super key basically if student IDs renamed is our super key the minimal one which can uniquely identify which can uniquely identify a particular row so when should I need should name the minimal of it minimal set would be student ID I'll know soon ID can you need me and if I threw so far in this case I can eat cake and be student ID or even phone number in this case because phone number alone can also uniquely identify this entire row because every student will have different phone numbers so even phone numbers can greatly identify all student hence connect ends it is a connecting there can be more than one can get him right as you can see there are two candidate keys in this example so basically candidate keys are the candidates for being primary key and primary key will only be one okay so sudra a phone number on your keys and if I have to choose one primary key primary key would be the most appropriate candy key and in this case student ID will be our primary key so I hope I hope it is clear the difficult moving super key and candidate key

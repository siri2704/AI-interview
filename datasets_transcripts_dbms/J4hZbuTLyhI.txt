hello everyone and welcome back in this video we are going to see the characteristics of relations the first characteristic of a relation is ordering of tuples within a relation in the previous video we learned that a table is also called a relation and we know that a relation or a table is a set of tuples or rows now mathematically we know that the elements in a set do not follow any order and as mentioned in the previous video theoretically relational databases were based on set theory so therefore just like the elements of the set need not follow any order the tuples in a relation also need not have any particular order but when it comes to files all the records are physically stored on disk or in the memory and since it's physically stored it would be good to have an order among the records like the first record second record and so on this helps in searching and retrieving the records faster but otherwise when we display a relation as a table there is no particular order to be maintained here i have taken an example of a student relation with attributes roll number name and age and i have three tuples in this relation even if i interchange the tuples in this relation the meaning of the relation will not change like for example in the same relation if i interchange the first two rows the meaning of the relation will remain the same so therefore it is not necessary for the tuples to be ordered with no relation that is ordering of tuples within a relation is not necessary or is not important the next characteristic of relation is ordering of values within a tuple as per the definition of relation an n tuple is an ordered list of n values let me take an example if i have a table or a relation student with attributes roll number name and age and if i take the values of the first tuple or the first row it has to maintain a particular order that is the first value has to be a roll number of the student the second value has to be a student name and the third value has to be the age of the student i cannot interchange the values within a tuple so ordering of values in a tuple is important with this definition where an n-tuple is an ordered list of n values with an alternative definition of relation the ordering of values in a tuple is unnecessary or not important and let us see why as per this alternative definition of relation a tuple is defined as a set of attribute value pair so when we write a tuple in this form then ordering of attributes is not important like for example if i take the second tuple from this relation and write it in the form of attribute value pair then it would be written this way where small t represents a tuple so when a tuple is a set of attribute value pair then ordering is not necessary because the attribute name and its corresponding value is mentioned together even if i change the order of these pairs as given over here the meaning will not change but generally we go with the first definition itself that is an n tuple is an ordered list of n values we go with the first definition because of its simplicity therefore as per the first definition ordering of values within a tuple is necessary or is important the next characteristic of a relation is values and nulls in a tuple again we have already learned in the previous video that each value in a tuple has to be an atomic value that is it has to be a value that cannot be divided further since the values has to be atomic we cannot have composite or multi-valued attributes in rdbms and because of that it is called as flat relational model we have learned in the er model what composite and multi-valued attributes are so composite attributes are attributes that can be divided further like address this attribute can be divided further into city state pin code etc these composite attributes are not allowed in relational databases because its values are not atomic instead these composite attributes can be represented by their simple component attributes as given in this relation so here i divided this composite attribute into city state and pin code so each value in the tuple has to be atomic also multi-valued attributes are attributes having a set of values or having multiple values for one entity so in rdbms or in relational databases these multivalued attributes have to be represented by separate relations or separate tables we will learn about that in detail in the later chapters next we have already learned about null values in the er model we can have several meanings for null values that is null values can be used when the value is unknown or when the value exists but it is not available or when the value is not applicable to that particular tuple since we have already learned about null values in the year model i'm just doing a quick recap here here i'm taking an example of a student relation suppose if i have an attribute say home phone or a landline phone some students will not have a landline phone so for those students the attribute home phone or landline phone will not be applicable and hence the corresponding value will be null that is the meaning of not applicable here this student has none for the mobile number attribute that could mean that either he may have a mobile phone or he may not have but we do not know hence a null value so the meaning of null value in this case is unknown also the meaning of null value could be that the value exists but it is not available so this is all about values and nulls in a tuple hope you have understood them the last characteristic of a relation is interpretation of a relation the relation schema can be represented as a declaration or assertion for example this relation schema asserts or declares that each student entity has a role number name age and a mobile so here with this relation schema you're trying to declare something about a student and each tuple can be interpreted as a fact for example the first tuple in this relation student declares the fact that there is a student named harry whose role number is 1 age is 19 and so on we have learned about entities and relationships in our previous videos so some relations may represent facts about entities whereas other relations may represent facts about relationships so that is about interpretation of a relation with this we come to the end of this video hope you have understood all the characteristics of relations that we discussed in this video thank you [Music] you

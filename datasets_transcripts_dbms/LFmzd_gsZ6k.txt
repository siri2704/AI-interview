we will have a look at what if relational database management system right so I already informed that relational database management system is one of the dbms uh way that it will help you to make your data is like more easily accessible and there are lots of features we have for rdbms so first let's have a look at what is a relational database management system so basically relational database management system which is in short known as rdbms is used for database management system that we all know the concept is based on the relation model as introduced by EF code right now we will have a look at the real what is basically stands for and what are the properties we have for rdpms the relationship between the data files is relational in rdpms they connect the data and the different files by using common data numbers or maybe using key Concepts so we will have a look at after this what are the those key Concepts and how we are going to use that key Concepts right so let's have a look at what are the properties we have for Rd is so we have values or Atomic in rdbms each row is different and columns are also different each column can have a common name and the Integrity constants help to maintain the data consistency for multiple tables so these are the properties we have for rdbms and there are lots of other properties is also there in rdbms and that will basically help you to have a proper structured way to solve your or to store your data right now we will have a look at so what are the difference between database management system and the file system and why should you go for database management system right so dbms is a collection of data but user is not required to write the procedures to manage the databases so whenever you want to manage your database that time dbms has its own features which will actually help you to proceed proceed your data but in the case of file system it is basically a collection of data obviously but any management with the file system has to write the procedures so now we will have a look at the difference between in dbms versus file system and why should you integrate your database to dbms and what are the features and advantages we get when we use bbms right so let's have a look at the file system is basically a collection of data that we all know and any management with the file system has to write the procedures right whenever you are going to make your data stored in file system or you want to manage them you need to have a manual effort in the case of dbms this is also a collection of data but user is not required to write the procedures to manage the data so dbm is basically helps you to reduce the human effort and it is more of a automatic task right so this can be the main reason why should you go for dbms now let's have a look at the second reason file systems are not efficient for storing retrieving of data right so let's give let me give you an example that whenever you are going to store a data in an Excel right so we know like for the most of the cases we go for Excel so if you want to go for Excel and you have a huge number of data from that data if you want to retrieve your data or if you want to find a data from that uh like from Excel it is quite time consuming and quite uh difficult right and this is also takes a human effort whereas dbms is efficient to use as there are large of varieties of techniques to store and retrieve the data so this is why dbms is except accepted all over the world because of its flexibility and large varieties of technique then we will have a look at the file system the third reason the file system does not has crash recovery mechanism right example like while we are entering some data into the file if the system crashes then content of the dot that file will be lost right but when as the dbms so in the case of dbms if you have a crash recovery option right we already have a crash recovery option it which is Protect by user from the effects of system failure right so this is why and this is how dbm is helping us to protect our data every way and protecting the file using file system is very very difficult so already we have talked about that file system is not secure whereas dbms has its own security process to save the data and you have lots of option uh by which you can make your data more protected right now let's have a look at what is the difference between dbms and rdbms okay so we know there are lots of dbms we have for uh the part of one of the parties rdbms but why rdbms are using all over the world and why it is so popular so let's have a look at that so dbms stores data as file in the case of rdbm installs the data in a tabular form in dbm is data is stored in two-way one is hierarchical form and or a navigational from but in the case of rdbms the table have a classifier known as primary key so we will also have a look at what is primary key and then the data values are stored in a tabular format so these are the main two key points and the cache for rdbms so basically I will give you a little brief about primary key so primary key helps you to make your data less redundant right and your data most compact and in a structured way okay now let's come the con like concepts of normalization so normalizing a data is one of the most important part wherever you are going to store your data so we'll have a look at that as well so in the case of dbms the normalization is not needed for the database so normalization is a most important part whenever we are going for the storing our data we will have a look at that as well why normalization is required when you go for storing your data right and in the case of rdbms you need to follow all the normalizations rules to store your data okay now let's have a look at dbms does not have any security for data manipulation okay but in the case of rdbms it has the Integrity constraint for the purpose of acid but what is a seat so basically acid is basically if you want to break them so a for automicity c for consistency I for isolation and D for durability right so this property makes RDM is one of the most popular using data based management system right now let's have a look at the less second option so in dbms there are no relation between the table so if you want to make a relation between your table you cannot do that but in the case of rdbms there should be a relationship between the data values it will help you to retrieve your data to structure your data more efficiently right now have a look at dbms is used for small organization we can understand from the features itself only and always deals with small data it also supports single user but when we go for rdbms it is basically used for large data because why because when we have large data we can make relation between them and it also supports multiple users so the examples of dbms is basically XML files and file systems but for the rdbms we have MySQL SQL Server Oracle postery Etc all right so I hope you can understand the what's the difference between dbms and rdbms

hello everyone welcome back to another video on crack Concepts and in today's video we will be discussing entity relationship diagram ER diagram ER model is a framework used in database design it is used to represent the structure of a database it looks something like this it will help you in understanding the structure of the database so it has tables these are entities student course we will understand all these different terms one by one but I just wanted to show you all how an ER model looks like so er model is used to represent the structure of the database how the database will look what all tables do we have and how are they related to each other there are three major components of an ER model so those are entities attributes and relationships so as you can see over here ER model consists of entity attribute and relationship entity could be any real world object student emplo Etc so this would be your table name students employees attribute is Properties or characteristics so age address mobile number Etc so these you can consider these as the columns in the table so these are attributes entity is any real world object attribute is any characteristic of these entities relationship it defines how different entities are related to each other so if we have two entities let's say student and department so how are they related to each other how are these two tables related so that comes under relationship there are three types of relationships one to one one to many many to many in one to one relationship each entity in one table is related to only one entity in the other table so let's say these are our two tables one is employee and the other table is passport table passport number and passport details is in this table and all the employee data is in this table what is the relation between employee table and the passport table it is one to one because each employee can have only one passport one passport number in such cases we will have one to one relationship second type of relationship is one to many let's consider this as teacher table and this as student table one teacher can teach many many students but each student will have only one teacher for a particular course let's say teacher a is teaching two students but those students can have only one teacher for a particular course a student cannot have two three teachers for a single course for a single subject and here is our third type of relationship which is many to many multiple entities in one table can be associated with multiple entities in the other table so let's say student and courses different students can apply for multiple courses let's say student a has enrolled for two courses data analytics and AI student B has enrolled for two courses Ai and Mathematics so multiple students can enroll for multiple courses and and each course can have multiple students as well four types of attributes simple composite derived multivalued s attribute as the name suggests it is a simple attribute like name name of the employee name of the student second one is composite composite attribute is an attribute which is made out of other attributes for example address it could be made of three other attributes let's say postal code nearest location Street house number all of these different attributes would combine together to make one single attribute which is address so address would would be called as composite attribute derived attribute would be attribute which is derived from another attribute let's say age age can be derived from from the attribute date of birth from date of birth you can find out age so that would be considered as derived attribute multivalued attribute means an attribute which can have multiple M values let's say mobile a single employee or student can have multiple mobile numbers is very important these are different shapes and what they signify so a rectangle signifies entity lips signifies attribute Diamond would mean relationship a single line can be used to connect these different ENT entities and attributes these relationships double ellipse can be considered as multivalued attributes rectangle can be considered as weak entity weak entity means an entity which is dependent on another entity that would be considered as a weak entity this is a very simple example of an ER diagram so we have two entities over here in rectangle student and course and these are the attributes the student has three attributes ID name and age course has two attributes course ID and course name and these are connected via a line and there is a diamond in between which would signify a relationship in this case study a student studies a course and you can also we can also write n and n over here which would mean that there is a many to many relationship between student and course student can apply for multiple courses and course can have multiple students which is why we have a many to many relationship between student and course this is all about entity relationship diagram I hope this video was helpful and if it was please make sure to subscribe to the channel check out our dbms playlist and also rest of the playlist on the channel we have SQL playlist we have python Java a lot of different playlist on the channel do check it out and with that I will end this video thank you so much for

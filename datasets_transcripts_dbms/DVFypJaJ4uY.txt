hello everyone welcome to Tech yum update YouTube channel today we are going to see about some of the basics of Oracle database so uh before seeing about the in-depth concepts of Oracle and also the architecture everything we'll say about the basics of the database management system what is database management system DPMS is nothing but a software for creating and managing the databases what is the software software is nothing but a communication Channel we call it as a APA between the user and the backend system okay dbm must act as a software for creating and managing the databases dbms makes it possible to end users to create protect read update and delete data in databases it actually serves as an interface between database and users ensuring data is consistently organized and remain easily accessible dbms supports database Administration tasks such as performance monitoring tuning security backup and Recovery we'll see about these in a separate videos next we'll see about the components of dbms some of the components include storage engine storage engine is used to store the data as the name indicates so here it dbms must interface with file system and the operating system level to store the data next comes the metadata catalog what is metadata metadata the word indicates it's a data about the data so for example if table is a data actually so what are the information we are going to store in a table for example if it is an employee table we'll be storing the employee information metadata is nothing but the data about the data it is the data about the employee table it means like how much size that which table space the table is created and whether it is permanent table or temporary table whether that table is partitioned or not those information we'll call it as a metadata catalog and it is stored in that Oracle data dictionary actually next comes the database access language for for APA to communicate with the backend system we need a language to communicate for the channel so here we'll be using the SQL language or the pl SQL language to communicate with the database management system next comes optimization engine optimization engine is nothing but used to pass the database access language request and turn them into actionable comments for accessing and modifying the data so this optimization engine shows us the best path for the Oracle database and based on this path the data will be retrieved from the database and showed it to the user next comes the query processor after a query is optimized dbms must provide a means for running the query and returning the results so for this the processor is needed to return the result to the user this is part used it because of the query processor next comes the log manager this is the crucial component of dbms manages concurrent access to the same data logs or required to ensure multiple users aren't trying to modify the same data simultaneously next comes the log manager log manager is used to record all the logs of all the activities that we are performing in the database this used for database recovery at any point of time next comes the database utilities examples of database utilities include the backup and Recovery Integrity check load data and load data and repair database we'll see about some of the benefits of using the dbms some of the benefits include data abstraction and data Independence and dbmus is mainly used for its security purposes and we are using locking mechanism for concurrent access and the official Handler to balance the needs of multiple application using the same data ability to swiftly recover from crashes and errors logging and auditing of activity and simple access using standard AP these were the benefits of using the dbms actually and in the upcoming videos we'll see detail about the Oracle databases the performance unit and all other thing about in depth about the Oracle database thank you for watching this video

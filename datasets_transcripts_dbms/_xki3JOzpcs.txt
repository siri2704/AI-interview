now our topic is difference between SQL and nosql databases we have already uploaded a course dbms module one in which we have already discussed in detail the common types of databases here we will concentrate on only two types of databases SQL and nosql databases now the first difference on which we will be discussing is the data model SQL databases primarily use relational data model what is the relational data model relational data model is a model which makes use of tables to store data in the table there are rows and columns in which the data is stored now in the case of no SQL databases they use various data models such as documents key value common family graph Etc now the next point is schema SQL databases have a predefined schema which means that the structure of the database of the data in the database is fixed and well defined in advance this makes it easy to query the data and ensure that the data is consistent on the other hand in the case of no SQL databases these databases are known for their flexibility and schema less or schema flexible approach nosql databases are better suited Source scenarios where data structures are less predictable or frequently evolving frequently evolving means the nature of the data changes now another point is query language structured query language SQL databases use the structured query language that is SQL as there query language SQL is a powerful standardized language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases on the other hand in the case of nosql databases they use different query languages depending on the data model we will discuss about various types of data models in the coming courses for example key value databases usually do not use complex query languages or data retrieval these databases retrieve and store data quickly using keys another example is each document database may have its own query language mongodb being a specific document database uses its own query language mql now the fourth point is scalability SQL databases are typically designed for vertical scaling that is scaling up which means that the performance of the database can be improved by increasing server resources like CPU memory and storage or other resources you have seen decrease which grow in this way that is upward so this is known as vertical scaling Suppose there is a house there is a vacant plot and you have built a room on it which can accommodate say two persons with the passage of time the size of the family increases and you have two options before you either you take or build a separate house or you can construct another room on it on the same plot you can construct another room it is in the same way that in the case of SQL there is vertical scaling that is we do not add more servers to meet up the expectations that is if the organization feels that the volume of data is increasing at it needs to make use of more servers or upgrade the present server in this case in this case of SQL vertical scaling is used that is this server is upgraded its memory its storage capacity or CPU is increased and though scaling out that that is adding more resources can be possible in the case of SQL but adding more servers is complex and expensive for SQL databases so in the case of SQL it is preferred that scaling a vertical scaling that is scaling up technique is used that is we increase CPU RAM storage and other resources so that we can handle the increasing data volume whereas in the case of n o SQL databases they are designed for horizontal scalability horizontal means in this way that is increasing the number of servers so that the increase in that data may be properly rendered which means that the performance of the database can be improved by adding more nodes or servers to the database SQL databases can continue to function even if one or more nodes fail that is suppose if there are four servers working if even if one server fails other servers will continue to function and overall the functioning of the organization will not be affected you can Avail you can scale your nosql databases up or down as needed that is if you feel if the organization feels that the volume of data has which it has to deal with has decreased suppose the organization the business is not growing at a very fast speed and the organization organization thinks that it need not to have the facility of as much servers as it is utilizing as one day so it may decide to reduce the number of servers it is using adding more servers can accommodate increased traffic or data growth and you can remove nodes when demand decreases that is when the demand or or of these servers in respect of this service you want to provide decreases that is the your need for data storage decreases then automatically you can decrease the number of services this is possible in case of nosql databases next point is use cases SQL databases are best suited for structured data we give the examples of structured data these are customer records product inventory and financial transactions whereas in the case of no SQL databases they are best suited for semi-structured or unstructured data and the examples of the same are social media posts reviews hashtags audio video files another point is development speed SQL that the development speed of SQL is slower due to schema constraints what is the meaning of development speed development speed means the time and effort required to maintain and build a database system that is it takes a lot of time and effort to build a SQL database system in the case of SQL whereas in the case of n o SQL development speed is faster due to schema flexibility and dynamic data next point is acid compliance we have already discussed in detail about the acid properties in tbms which is atomicity consistency isolation foreign databases are traditionally designed to follow acid properties strictly no SQL databases vary in their degree of adherence to acid properties some no SQL databases especially new SQL databases provide strong acid grantees that is they strictly follow the acid properties in dbms d stands for durability While others prioritize performance and scalability over strict acid compliance now another point is atomicity SQL databases guarantee that transactions are Atomic that is the transactions either are fully completed or fully rolled back in case of failure the failure may be power failure internet failure or any other there are no partial transactions in the case of no SQL databases atomicity depends on the specific nosql database the atomicity of the transactions may be more relaxed next moment is consistency SQL databases ensure data consistency enforcing rules and constraints we will also discuss in detail how the relational model ensures data Integrity through constraints and rules on the other hand nosql databases the level of consistency enforcement varies among no SQL databases some nosql databases offer strong consistency while some other no SQL databases provide eventual consistency which allows for temporary consistencies that are resolved over time next point is isolation SQL databases provide isolation between concurrent transactions this means that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other and each transaction appears to run in isolation from others isolation levels in no SQL databases can differ some databases offer strong isolation while some other nosql databases offer weaker forms of isolation next point is durability SQL databases guarantee the durability of committee transactions committee transactions are those transactions which have been saved in the database once a transaction is committed its changes are permanently stored and Will Survive system failure durability grantees are typically maintained in no SQL databases once data is committed it is durably stored however in certain situations some no SQL databases allow users to reduce the level of durability in exchange for improved system performance next point is data structure SQL databases store data in tables which is made up of rows and columns each table in a row represents a single record and each column contains a single piece of data about that record you have already learned that in the case of relational model there are rows these are the columns and we may here take the example of implies in that case there may be column heading imply name employee ID then imply contact number and much more these are this is rho and this is the column this is what is written in this row is known as the record and what is written in the columns it is known as a single piece of data about that record on the other hand no SQL databases store data in different ways depending on the data model they use for example key value databases store data as pairs of keys and Associated values document desktop basis row data as documents and graph databases store data in the form of graph like structure no we will see the examples of SQL databases the examples of SQL databases are Oracle database MySQL Microsoft SQL Server in the case of no SQL databases the examples are mongodb Cassandra reduce Amazon dynamodb now we will conclude the difference between n between SQL and nosql databases the choice between SQL and no SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application that is data structure scalability needs query complexity or performance goals many organizations use both SQL and no SQL databases together why to handle the different types of data storage and retrieval requirements for example an organization might use a SQL databases to store customer data and the same organization may also use the other database that is no SQL database to store social media data we may take the example of Amazon it may take the it may use both types of dbms SQL to store the customer information or product debt catalogs and no SQL database to store social media data that is the audio video files reviews by the customers if the organizations use both type of databases then it allows the organizations to make to get the best of the two words to get the best of the two words means to get the benefits of both types of databases and what are those benefits the flexibility and scalability of nosql databases and the performance and acid grantees of SQL databases that is the organization can take the benefits of sections of both these types of databases if they use both of these databases thanks for watching if you like our course please bear

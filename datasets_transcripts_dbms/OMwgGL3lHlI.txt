hello everyone i welcome you all to this wonderful course on database management systems before we start the session let's see a quote by alan coven do not wait until conditions are perfect to begin beginning makes the conditions perfect with this wonderful quote let's begin this journey with the introduction before we step into the introduction to the subject i just wanted to give an analogy to understand the significance of having dbms in our day-to-day activities just assume i am owning a manufacturing company where i manufacture pens and pencils do you guys think that manufacturing alone enough without storing the data about the manufactured items i would say no just manufacturing a loan is not sufficient we need to maintain the complete database of all the manufactured items and not only this we are also required to maintain many more data why it is so let's take this pencil as an example once this pencil is manufactured the details such as the length of the pencil the color of the pencil the date of manufacturing of this pencil the price of the pencil the model of this pencil qr code barcode batch location and other details have to be stored in the database why do we need to store all this information in the database say here we are storing the length the color the date of manufacturing price model qr code barcode all the required data we are storing why we need to store all these data permanently because data is a precious thing and will last longer than the system themselves and also in today's world data is the new signs so from this what we are understanding is i am the manufacturing company owner and i am producing pens and pencils and i am storing all the information about the manufactured items in my database let's assume one of my customers has raised a complaint about one manufactured item it may be a pen or a pencil as the owner it's my ultimate responsibility to look into the customer complaint because customers are the kings of any business for example let's assume i am collecting the barcode or the qr code of the faulty pin or pencil once the qr code or the barcode of the faulty pen or pencil is collected using these data we can find out what has gone wrong with the manufactured item and this is possible only when we store all the information in our database do you think it is ridiculous that customer is complaining about a low cost item no certainly it is not a ridiculous thing because customers are not only customers they are the actual consumers of the product and they have all rights to express their satisfaction appreciation give feedbacks give suggestions and even complaints if a complaint is received about a particular item then it's my responsibility as the owner to also check the whole batch or the particular date of manufacturing for further analysis to know only one item is faulty or the whole batch is faulty why the manufacturers need to do this because they need to sustain in the market and grow well in the market and not only that to be involved in continuous improvement to file taxes regularly and they need to be transparent when they will be transparent when all the data about the manufactured item is stored permanently only then they will be accountable so i mean to say if we want to be transparent and accountable all data must be well documented to be precise all data must be well maintained in a database like this in this analogy the data that we maintain includes not only the manufactured items but also the employee or the hr details the accounts finance the research and development details the complaints and redressal details the logistics details sales and many more and storing all these data is strongly recommended and where the organization is going to store is it going to store in the files no it's going to store all the data in a database like this why do we need to store the data in the database like this and that's why we are here in this subject the database management system be it any industry or organization databases are inevitable trust me guys whether it is a manufacturing company or an hospital environment a school or a university banking environment airlines supermarket insurance and whatnot databases are inevitable so from this what we understood all the data must be stored in the database permanently about all the manufacture details in addition we need to maintain all the data possible to be transparent and accountable so far we have seen an analogy to understand the importance of having dpms in our day to day activities let's now see the target audience of this course to whom this course is actually intended to this course is actually intended to the ug students if you are an aspirant undergoing competitive exams like gate isro or any other competitive examinations then you are in the right place if you want to demystify the database technologies and jargons used in the database world welcome to this playlist and in this contemporary world we have the requirement for data analyst and business analyst for which database knowledge is very much essential we have just seen the target audience let's now see the syllabus of this course in this subject we are going to see 14 chapters chapter number one is introduction to the relational database management system simply rdbms in second chapter we will be focusing on the relational database in third chapter we will be focusing on database design and the entity relationship model simply called as er model in the fourth chapter we will be focusing on introduction to the structured query language sql which is one of the popular database languages and in chapter 4 we will be dealing about the basics of sql in chapter 5 we will be focusing on the advanced sql features like the procedures triggers functions etc in chapter 6 we will be focusing on the formal relational query languages the double relational calculus and the domain relational calculus we will also be focusing on the relational algebra in chapter 7 we will be focusing on the normalization and the various normal forms with the dependencies the functional dependency the full functional dependency partial dependency transitive dependency joint dependency multi-value dependency and many more with relevant examples and in chapter 8 we'll be focusing on storage and file structures because databases directly deals with the storage of data so we are required to know the basics behind the storage and the file structure in order to improve the performance of the database we need chapter number 9 which is indexing and hashing and chapter number 10 deals with query processing and query optimization we know databases are going to respond to the queries that we supply so we need to process the query and we need to optimize the query in order to achieve better performance and efficiency chapter number 11 deals with the transactions and concurrency control chapter number 12 we will be dealing about the database system architectures which includes the distributed database architecture the parallel databases etc and chapter number 13 we will be seeing the introduction to the data warehousing and data mining techniques and then we will be concluding the subject with the last chapter the 14th chapter xml and advanced databases we are done with the syllabus of dbms let's now see the scope you may be asking me what's the use of studying this subject this subject is very very important because in every organization which uses database there is a key responsible designation the database administrators simply called as dbs he is the one who has the complete privilege over the complete database if you want to become a database administrator then obviously we need the subject database management system and already mentioned we have data analyst and business analyst job opportunities as well and if you study dbms then this is going to be the basics for acquiring the job in the data analysis or business analysis market and not only that industries are nowadays looking for employees who are full stack developers they are not going to deal with only the front-end development activities i mean the user or the web interface development the developers are also expected to have the back-end knowledge where databases are the back-end as mentioned industries are expecting full stack developers and that's why it has become mandatory to learn database management system and finally if you want to become a database tester or software tester or penetration tester simply pen testers then databases are very much important i hope now you understood the significance of having dbms in our day-to-day activities so with the fingers crossed let's see about database management system elaborately with the formal definition in the next lecture i hope you guys enjoyed this presentation and thank you for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

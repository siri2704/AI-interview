Hello friends, Welcome to Gate Smashers the topic is Joins Joins is a very important topic of DBMS and joins is covered in relational algebra as well as in sequel algebra means the relational algebra what is it? It is mathematical expression means the sequel which we actually implement how do we implement? in structured query language but in relational algebra joins has its own syntax and in sequel has separate syntax obviously because sequel is an implementation language actually the concept is relational algebra where we denote joins with mathematical expressions but when we come to sequel the same mathematical expressions we write in the form of SQL commands so there is only one concept the joins whether we talk about relational algebra or about sequel joins is only one there is only one concept but the way of writing it, syntax is different relational algebra has different syntax sequel has different syntax so here if we talk first, joins What are joins? It is clear from the name itself when we have to join 2 or more tables to find any result means we have to find such a result which I am not getting from 1 table for that I have made one simple example here let's say there is one employee table employee table has 3 attributes employee name employee's No. employee's name and address now if you see carefully in employee table what information I can get detail of employee means suppose I have to find out employee's ID his name  is Varun or tell employee name whose ID is this or tell the address of employee means from this table what information can I get? only details of employee let's say I ask a simple question I have to find out employee's address whose name is Varun let's say we have to find the address of employee What is the address of employee whose name is Varun so for this I only need the help of employee table means I can find out the data from employee table so how do we write the query? there is a simple way of writing query Select, what we have to find? address, because finally I want to print the address from which table employee I don't need any other table so select address from employee but I don't have to check all the address I have to check only the address of one whose name is Varun so I will put where condition here where name name means E name E name = Varun so where there is E name is equal to Varun its address will be finally printed out so what will come in final? CHD that is Chandigarh so this output will come to me finally If I talk about department table what the department table is telling me department's No. department's Name and employee No. why I have written employee No. here? because I have to find out which employee is working in which department therefore I have kept employee  No. common here employee No. is in this table and also in this table it will act in this table as a foreign key it will act as a foreign key from where it will take reference from primary key means in employee table employee No. is primary key and from here it will take reference I have already explained the concept of foreign key that why do we use it what is the purpose? so concept of foreign key, concept of primary key I already believe that you know about this concept because join is an advance topic where you should be knowing about basic sequel you should know in advance about the concept of foreign key and primary key incase you don't know about these then you can check my videos it is about foreign key and it is also about concept of primary key and keys their link I will share with you in the description box so  i am making a basic assumption that you know about these things so here if I talk about department table so what answer I am getting from department table what thing I am getting? only details of the department means which employee is working in which department and what is the name of that department means if I say that i have to find the name of the department whose department No. is D3 so how will I find, same select name from department where department No. is equal to D3 means this is a simple concept that if you want details of employee then you find out from this table and if you want details of department then find out from this table so to solve these questions to solve basic questions you don't need join but if I change the question here let's say the question is I am just writing the question here when we will talk about joins, then the answer will be clear to you if I am writing the question find employee name or display employee name of employee whose working in HR so now look at the question carefully because when we will be knowing in which scenario I have to use joins then only we can explain it in best way and we can grab that concept in a best way if I do not know where joins are used in which scenario they are used so there is no concept of cramping the joints here This is a very good topic in its entirely if you follow joins one by one, follow my videos one by one you will easily know what is the concept of joins and this in UGC net exams, in gate exams and other competitive exams in your college and university exams plus in interviews specially if any company is asking questions from DBMS in sequel then it will definitely come on the concept of joins so here the question is find the name of employee who is working in the HR department who is working in HR department whenever you get this type of question first look carefully that HR department is in which table in department table and employee's name is in which table in employee table so to solve this question I need the help of employee table as well as help of department table wherever you need help of two or more tables what you have to use joins means only with the help of joins you can solve this questions although we can use sub queries the way of writing concept of sub queries and joins is different but the way of using them is same because in both of them joins and sub queries will give same answer but sub queries is somewhat complex in writing because you have to write the query multiple times so it is easier to write joins it is easier to write the queries of joins so therefore I am first discussing on the concept of joins and not on sub queries so you can easily find out this question with joins but joins but before that basically in which scenario do you use joins the two tables which are here employee and department joins can be applied only when if there is some thing common in between the two tables so do remember this assumption there must be some common common attribute there should be common attribute between the two tables where you are using joins so you see carefully is there something common in the tables, any common attribute yes employee No. if employee No. is not present in this table then you can't join this two tables there is no benefit of doing until there is nothing common in two tables why I will join them why I will join them so therefore this is the first need that in two tables there must be something common, at least one attribute  must be common and second in joins always remember what is join? it is cross product cross product plus some condition cross product plus some condition or we can say it plus select statement select statement which we also call condition statement because from select we write condition so what is join it is cross product plus selection about cross join, cross product I have already told here there is also a video on cross product but when we start joins there I will once again tell you about joins so here in this video I have to only tell what are joins in which scenario do we use joins and type of joins so join types the basic one which are used most cross join or we also call it cross product in actual it is cross product natural join this is the most important natural join which is very much important conditional join, equi join sell join is also very important and outer join in outer join also there are 3 further left outer right outer and full outer join so this is a basic video why we use joins where it is used and what are its types now we will one by one discuss about joins with example so if you liked my video then please like it share it and please subscribe my channel Thank you.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi everyone myself navat Ravi working as assistant professor in mlr Institute of Technology in cyber security and data science department in today's session we are going to discuss about conceptual design with ER model so the overview of this concept includes entity versus attribute entity versus relationship binary versus tary relationship and aggregation versus tary relationship so before going to know about this concept we need to be thorough about what is entity what is attribute what what are the types of relationships so that we all discuss in the previous sessions to consider a particular diagram it's purely based upon the application or the design whatever you are going to develop so here we used to add one more attribute one more entity duration and for that entity I have represented the attributes from Two and in the diagram in the above diagram here we have only two entities and the attributes are represented to the relationship itself as a descriptive attributes that is also correct correct but we if at all we have many more number of large volumes of data then we can we can prefer the second one that is what we call as entity versus attribute whether we should uh consider a particular concept as an entity or an attribute the second thing is entity versus relationship whether we should design a concept as an entity or a relationship let us consider uh this one with an example here in this diagram we have two entities customer borrows loan right customer borrows loan and customer have some attributes and Loan have some attributes and an alternative model see here customer the loan here which is considered as an entity in the second diagram it is considered as an relationship it is consider as an both are same both are not same but both can be considered it depends upon the application that you're going to develop so here the customer borrows loan from some different branches right so the same the same object what you are going to represent that can be considered as an entity and that can be considered as an relationship too that is the uh reason why we have represented here entity versus relationship it purely depends upon the database application that you're are going to develop so customer which Bor who borrows loan from different branches and here the loan contains loan number and amount loan number and amount here in the first diagram the loan is considered as an entity in the second diagram the same loan can be considered as an relationship with the attributes what are those attributes called as descriptive attributes right the next one binary versus stary relationship so what is binary relationship if at all a relation contains two two entities exactly then it is called as binary relationship ship and a relationship contains exactly three entities then it is called as tary relationship so here which one we use to consider right that is the uh concept here binary versus stary relationship so in these two what is binary relationship what is tary relationship a relationship that has only two entities one two that is what we called as binary binary relationship a relationship can have three entities employees duration departments it is called as tary relationship so we can consider any of these uh two models any of these two ER models here by while considering the first one employees Works in departments and the to know about the duration from which date to which date whether that employee works that will be considered here with the help of descriptive attributes and in this diagram the duration period of the employees will be maintained in separate entity set as a separate entity set with the attributes from two that is the basic difference between binary versus tary relationship so if at all we want the data clear cut in a clearcut manner and uh if at all we used to maintain some large volumes of data then we used to prefer tary relationship and the last one is aggregation versus is stary relationship in the last video we have discussed about what is aggregation right so here uh aggregation is nothing but as I said to relate two particular set of entities or uh to relate two entities right so what should we consider whether we should consider aggregation uh type of er model or else stary relationship let us discuss with these two examples same example here employees monitors projects sponsored by the Departments employee monitors project sponsored by the Departments so we we have here three particular entities employees projects departments and only single relationship that is what we called as monitors and sponsors right so coming to the aggregation this is what we called as aggregation and this is what we called as stary relationship why because as I said a relationship contains exactly three entities that is called as Turner relationship so here aggregation see employee monitors employee monitors projects sponsored by the Departments which is more clear than considering this turn relationship which can be aggregation is meant for a meaningful ER model rather than considering ternary binary unary relationships aggregation will be more meaningful so here employees The Entity employees monitors this is one big entity which contains which itself contains entities and relationships so employees monitors projects sponsored by the Departments and here each and every entity has its own set of attributes and the relationship may also contain the attributes which those attributes are called as descriptive attributes so till now we have discussed four different types of conceptual design with ER model so what are those things nothing but entity versus attribute entity versus attribute second one entity versus relationship entity versus attribute entity versus relationship binary versus tary relationship and the fourth one is aggregation this is the one aggregation versus tary relationship so whatever the ER model that you are going to uh opt that will be purely depends upon the model or else the project that you are developing entity versus attribute whether you should consider a particular concept as an entity or an attribute and the second one is entity versus relationship whether you are modeling a particular project and in that particular project the particular object can be considered as an entity or a relationship whether you are modeling a particular project you have to consider that object as an binary or else stary and the last one is aggregation versus tary relationship so this is all meant for conceptual design with ER model thank you

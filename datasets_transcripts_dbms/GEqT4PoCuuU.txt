hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I'll be covering conceptual design with the ER model in dbms guys I have uploaded complete dbms subject tutorials I'll provide a link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started conceptual design is the second phase in the database design process guys in database design process second step is conceptual design and whereas first phase is requirement Gathering after Gathering all requirements from the user in software company there is database designer the main duty of this database designer is to design ER diagrams so in conceptual design phase we will Design ER diagrams while creating ER diagrams in conceptual design phase this database designer has several choices like should a concept to be modeled as an entity or attribute should your concept to be modeled as an entity or relationship set should your concept to be modeled as a binary artery in a relationship or should your concept to be modeled as an aggregation or terrinery relationship this is entirely designer choice I will explain each of them at first I will explain attribute versus entity set for example there is an employee entity this employee entity contains three attributes their name ID and address for example I want to give single address like Hyderabad daily Goa so if you want to give only single address then you can select address as an attribute here I want to enter single address so I am selecting address as an attribute but I don't want to enter single address I want to enter complete address like City Hyderabad Street nagole and house number 28-864 I want to enter this complete address at that time what I will do is I will select address as an entity inside address entity I will create three attributes they are city state and house number guys entity is nothing but table name and whereas attribute is nothing but column names here at first I selected address as an attribute that is nothing but column name and whereas here I selected address as an entity that is nothing but table name just I am writing here employee has address I am establishing has relationship between employee and address either you can select address as an attribute or entity it is completely designer choice this is all about attribute versus entity next I will explain entity set versus relationship set for example there is employee entity this employee entity contains three attributes they are Name ID and salary and there is another entity that ended in Ms Department this department entity contains DNA and did attributes employee manages Department here I am establishing manager's relationship and here for manage relationship I am creating three attributes they are since since at what time he is managing manager's name and budget how much budget that particular manager is given in order to manage Department here I took managers as relationships it but all employees will not manage Department only managers will manage Department but here I written employee managed department but this is entirely wrong concept because employee will not manage Department only manager will manage department so what I will do is I will convert this manage relationship into manager's entity here from employee entity I am deriving managers entity and I am assigning all these attributes to this manager so just share it on your employee is a manager and I'm assigning all these attributes to this manager so manager manage department now it is perfect here manages his relationship and whereas your manager is entity this selection binary versus cedinary relationship if we establish relationship between two entities then we call those relationship as binary relationship but if we establish relationship between three entities then we call those relation as a memory relationship for example there are two entities one is supplier Center and next one is product entity as we know supplier buys product it first in order to sell product it for suppliers will buy products suppliers buys product I am establishing bias relationship between these suppliers and product suppliers has attributes like Name ID and product as attributes like pnm and PID and similarly customers also buys product so gesture return your customers buys product so I am establishing biased relationship between these customers and product instead of creating two binary relationships what I will do is I will create only one ordinary relationship by combining the suppliers and customers if there is relationship between three entities then we call it a stationary relationship and next one is aggregation versus stationary relationship this is ternary relationship suppliers buys product customers buys product both suppliers and customers buys product so what I will do is I will convert these two entities into single entity by establishing along with relationship so suppliers along with customers consider single entity so gesture returns your suppliers along with customers buys product yes suppliers along with customers is considered a single entity and I am establishing bias relationship this is all about conceptual design

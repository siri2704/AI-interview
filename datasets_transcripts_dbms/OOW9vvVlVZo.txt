hey there this is me anil welcome to education that i'm creating a series of database lectures today we are going to talk about database normalization this will help you to clarify your concept of database normalization and how to practically perform this along with what is the importance of primary key foreign key composite key so i will cover this in the lecture today if you have not seen earlier videos on this series i would recommend you to go and watch that and do practical sessions as well this will give you a lot of idea [Music] let's understand the importance of database normalization why it is required so in general since before i go and talk about some of the topics mentioned here when you have a book you can keep it anywhere on your table or anywhere in your room it's easier to find easy to navigate but just consider of a situation that you need to manage a library of several books you do not have choice to put it anywhere similarly with database you have to organize things to retrieve faster to manage effectively and that is where database normalization is very useful so let's have a look normalization when we talk about that is with different categories so first normal forms second normal form third normal form up to this point these are must and these are to be followed for a bit better database design whereas some of the upcoming normalization bcnf washington court normal form fourth normal form so this one is in between of third and fourth normal form whereas there is fifth normal form six normal form which is proposed but in lecture today i am going to talk about which you will need the most and that is more for practical purpose whereas some of these are more on the theoretical knowledge let me know if you want to learn them i will create another video for that but today we are going to talk about first normal form second normal form and third normal form let's understand the importance of normalization let's understand what is denormalization denormalization is you are just organizing the data in a manner where you are keeping multiple records by comma separated so that's a one example of denormalization if you look at this example you will notice that anal bhp first identity right and uh and viva bhai fee with the street two is a second identity and viva part p with the street three is a third identity but you will notice that movies rented sholey and villain these should be idly been different record but just wanted to like um that's where it is denormalized we are keeping this information as a comma separated and that's where we can keep any number of information by comma separating its it will less number of rows but it's very difficult to query or very difficult to manage so that's the problem with the normalization and that is where normalization was introduced and and i have violated another example with gang gangster and enable two movies are comma separated so what is first normal form first normal form says we have to create a table or organize a table in a manner that it should have unique records which means i'm just removing this comma separated value and rather than having three records i will have five records each record is a unique record against the information so it does not have any keys as such but the records are not comma separated and it should be unique so that's the first normal form let's talk about the second normal form so why we need second normal form as you will notice that this anal bhajpri with the street one and uh viva rgp with the street two and we were yp with street three these are three different identities and to uniquely identify we have to use this composite key we have to use physical address along with full names all the time so what is the solution we can create a primary key table and uh we can have anil by pay vip hp and the next one saved as this one so for which we have to create the primary key what is the primary key i will just explain and so just just think about it it's a number given number or any value which uniquely identifies the record is called the primary key so what we are doing here we have created three primary keys uh one primary key uh which has three value one two three and each uniquely identifies different persona here angle by three with the street one weber white phase three two we watch treat these so that's where we can manage this information and we can in a way segregating all person related information in one table whereas the other table will have the foreign key so you will notice i'll just zoom out you will notice that member id which means anil rented how many movies two movies chole and villain right so these are the foreign key so basically this to create a relationship between a child table and parent table in this case this will be called parent table and this will be called as child table so you will also hear something similarly master child or parent child a master slave so this is because of the parent primary key and foreign relationship before i move forward for third normal form let me give you some quick view what is primary key versus foreign key so just think about one example here if we have to store the information of aadhaar number ename job salary and department and we are creating a uniquely we are creating a key to identify so in general if you talk about every student in a class will be identified by role number any employee in the organization is identified by employee code so these are just the codes to identify a single person because sometimes with the same name same information there could be multiple people or multiple employees multiple students in the class multiple employees in the organization so that's the case to uniquely identify we can use employee code or roll number things like that similarly if you're in u.s you have ssn if you're in india you have aadhaar card you have passport number you have pan card these are the unique number which identifies who's the person we are talking about so primary key is a number allocated to individual employee for their unique identification then if we need to link any other information with that we can use the foreign key so in this example you will notice we have two table where this is the primary key for table this one right and uh our number is also uh uniquely identifier so if if we need if we do not have the primary key so maybe more than one key combined together it's called composite key we can use that as well to identify but in general we create the primary key now this table has the department number this is the child table right this is the child table child table of what of parent table department which means first you will create the department and then you will allocate employees in that on department number you will see it's a primary key of this table which have number allocated for different department now this primary key is linked through a foreign key in a different table which is employee table and in this employee table you have this foreign key connected which means if you are entering a new record in employee table where department does not exist database itself will throw an error and you should not be able to proceed similarly if you are not obeying the rule of primary key saving any record without providing the primary key which is unique database will also throw some error so that is primary key and foreign key now there could be a concept of what is unique very general question asked during the interview so difference between primary key and unique game the only difference between primary and unikey it can have one null value whereas primary key will always be not null so think about one table where a column is unique which means it will it can have not necessary it can have one null value but rest of the value will be unique because null itself will be a value which is unique so let's say that we have a table where null one two three these all are unique you will notice these all are unique we cannot have two nulls here this this is not the unique we cannot have two nulls but at least one null is allowed with unique key whereas in primary key even this null is not allowed so that is the difference between primary key and unikey hopefully you are able to understand now let's get back to this example where we are talking about second normal form and what we have done we broke down this structure into two tables you will notice one thing that this salutation is still dependent on full names here for example if i want to change the full name here it will require salutation to be changed as well so this is called a transitive dependency we want to avoid this as well so what we can do we can create one table the same table like we had earlier we will create another table this will just represent celebration so we could have three type of salutation mr mrs miz and we have given different ids to it whereas on salutation which is a linking between these two so you can say this is the primary key table or the master table for salutation and this becomes your child table because this foreign key linked to the master table of salutation right so that's how we are managing and that's where to break number of transitive dependency that's become the third normal form now you can also have movies rented this one i'm giving you this for your homework you can also have another table which will have movies as a primary key table right which means you will have one for surely one is a primary key for chole 2 as a primary key for villain three as a primary key for king gesture and this table will become your mapping table which will have foreign key from two different tables and to give a relationship which member rented what particular movie hopefully you are able to understand the concept i am not going to give the practical i would request you to do the practicals create all these tables and let me know if you face any challenges thanks for watching

a very good afternoon everyone so my name is nit and uh today I will be presenting on database Management systems and dbms so this presentation will help us understand how data is organized stored and managed efficiently using dbms so by the end you will see why databases are crucial in almost every Industries so let's begin on introduction so data is everywhere from online banking transactions to e-commerce purchases and social media interactions and business records everything is stored in databases but how do we efficiently store and retrieve and upon it how can we manage such massive amounts of data so let's get on an overview with it a database management system plays a key role in handling this information in today's sessions we'll explore it definition importance types architectures SQL fundamentals and also security measures understanding dbms is essential for anyone working with data so without data there is nothing in this world and when you have to work with data you should understand how dbms works so whether in software development or business or research it doesn't matter you have to understand dbms if you are working with data so getting on the overview so what's the definition of tbms a database management system is a software that allows users to create retri update and manage databases efficiently it acts as a bridge between users and the database it also ensures smoother interaction with data actually so why dbms is important why is it important actually without a proper system managing a data would be chotic just imagine if there is no dbms how would you allocate your data and how if you allocating and you storing something how can you find you can go you can't possibly go through every individual data and find your searching data so where it helps it can reduce data redundency where it avoids duplicate data storage and it also ensures data Integrity where is maintaining an accur and consistency upon that it is also providing security actually where it can prevent unauthorized access and supporting multiple users like enabling concurrent access without conflicts and Etc so after the importance real world application is very important so where is dbms used literally dbms is used everywhere in banking systems they use it for transactions processing and secure data storage okay and in e-commerce platforms they're using to manage product catalogs and customer details and orders whatever they are getting and the most important thing where they are using right now and what we are using in our daily life it's literally social media networks where they use it to store a profile datas interactions and multimedia and Etc and and there are many types in the database like different application requires different types of databases so let's look at the main types so the first type is a relational database these are the most common databases where is can store data and structure tables in rows with columns a table can always contain a row and column so they use SQL language where it's known as structured query language so what for what purpose they going to use it they're using it to manipulate the data for example um it can include MySQL and uh post G SQL and Oracle database actually so as we speak about SQL data language sorry SQL database management system there are also no SQL databases so what it's actually designed for or it is designed for handling unstructured or semi-structured data so no SQL databases can provide flexibility and uh it can also U provide scalability so they used in big data and realtime applications for example it can include mongodb and uh kazandra and uh reies so these are the nosql databases if you are going for a minimum list database you can always go for a no SQL database there are also other database models apart from the relational and noal databases there are also three kinds of database which are hierarchical database and network database and objectoriented database so hcal database is nothing but data is stored in a Tre like structure where uh as you know uh in data structure we have read about three structures so that's where the hierarchical databases use it so in network databases if you're having a complex relationships between your data elements you can always go for Network databases is always reliable for complex relationships and as the name says the object oriented databases stores data in object format where uh it is actually used in advanced applications and uh let's go into the architecture of dbms the we a database is structured determines its efficiency and performance so there are three main architectures so first architecture is all components res on a single machine so the setup is mainly used for development and testing environments where a developer has a direct access to the database without an any intermediate layer we I'm a database developer I should have my uh direct access to the database that's where first architecture comes in and the two architecture is like um the client server model actually where the client communicates directly with the database server it improves performance but as the performance improves it only has a limit scalability so to get over the first TI and second architecture the third Tire architecture goes with the most scalable approach it consists of so there are three layers in it user interface layer and that's where the front end and the users interact with and the second layer can be the application layer where the business Logics and process requests are handled over there and the final layer is a database layer so that's where the data is stored and manages efficiently so this architecture is using large scale Enterprise applications so for what purposes means it can be used for better performance security and scalability comparing to the previous two architectures so getting into the SQL fundamentals and uh SQL commands and overview can go on so SQL or structured query language is a standard language used for interacting relational databases so SQL is divided into different categories based on its functions and uh data definition language can be like and defines the structure of the database actually for there are three commands mainly which is create alter and drop so if you have to create a table you going to use a create table and table name and following through and if you have to modify the table structure you're going to use your alter command so once you have created and altered whatever you have done you're done with your table so you have to delete your table right now that's where you're going to use your drop command which totally delet your table so once we have defined the structure of the database we're going to manipulate it what's the use of the database if you can't manipulate your data so that's where data manipulation language comes in so it can manages the data within the tables actually so I have created my table and I have modified my table structure what I'm going to do I'm going to insert new records actually so that's where the insert commands comes in using insert and the values inside it I'm going to insert my values in my table so I have once I have inserted my elements what I'm going to do means for suppose instead of my name I have given my friend's name I'm going to use my update command to modify my existing record so if I have given an one more unwanted extra record what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my delete command to remove remove it from my record so that's where the data manipulation language comes in so mastering SQL is a crucial for database management and it's very efficient for data retrial actually so apart from what are the structures and what are the architectures what clients actually look for is the single thing and very crucial for database management system it's actually security so with data breaches On The Rise database security is a top priority there are many threats to database security databases are vulnerable to various threats including unauthorized access that's where hackers or insiders access sensitive data so imagine someone access your data and they have breached it and given it to your opponent companies and that's where millions of dollars will be lost there are also SQL injection attacks like exploiting vulnerabilities to manipulate your queries they can literally manipulate your queries if you have done the SQ injection attack so apart from that the data breaches leaks the expose of a confidential data imagine you storing your country's very crucial nuclear reactors codes and if someone have breached into it that's the end of us so that's where the threats of database security has done so what can I take to prevent my non-authorized access on database use authorization so there are also techniques such as usernames and it's the very most basic method I can give for authorization so there are also multiactor authorization MFA so it can add an extra security layer for it and apart from that if you are using biometric verifications it is the most enhanced version of security that you can you can give fingerprints or facial loation on voice recognition whatever you can so that's where the authentication method comes in so once it is done the access control takes the place where your security is the most crucial thing so to to further enhance security um database uses Access Control mechanisms such as role based access control and uh mandatory access control and discretionary Access Control where rbac the which is a role based access control it can grant permission based on our user roles so if your user role has a particular access control that's the rbac in action and also there can be mandatory access controls which can enforce strict security policies you can't actually bre breach your security policies in the database management system so and the last access control which is also direct Direction Access Control control it allows your data owners to set permissions if I'm here and I have a data I can set only my friend can visit my records so that's where Direction Access Control comes in a will secure database ensures data privacy integrity and compliance with industry regulations so that's a that's what we call a bu secure database in conclusion and to summarize uh database Management Systems it is essential for organizing storing and securing data efficiently so we explored its importance types architecture SQL fundamentals and security measures and uh understanding dbms is a valuable skill in today's data re World whether you are a software developer a business analyst or you can also be a database ad minator so mastering dbms will open up a new career opportunities so that's why we are going to go through the future and future data is everything so if you have to adapt you have to learn database management system it doesn't depend on your career it can be you can be a software developer or business anything but you have to master dbms to control or manipulate the data so that brings us to the end of the presentation thank you for your time and it be happy to take any questions now

so uh we'll start with the course now first before diving into SQL we need to know what is dbms right so dbms is nothing but database management system okay now what is the database management system it is nothing but you have your data and it needs to be managed by a system or a or a set of instructions or set of rules right that is what dbms is so if you see in this diagram which is very well explained so what we do have here is the relational databases the databases is what we have here so we have relational database we have hierarchy database we have flat files or we have the objects right so these are nothing but the databases that we have which can store data and data can be stored in any form when we say relational relational is nothing but where you have data stored in the tabular format so you have multiple tables and each table is joined to the other table using some relation so it may be a salary and an employee stable so both the tables are joined using the employee ID okay uh or you may have a hierarchy database where uh you will have um the so the highest table may be uh the college for example if you take a college system so the highest maybe the college then below that you can have uh the multiple um so multiple tables such as the employees the teachers the students right then we have flat files which is just for example an Excel file right a flat file or you have objects database right where your data is uh considered to be objects what are objects now so for example you have a car okay so a car can be of various models okay now automobile if you now consider automobile is something which anyone can use to go from one place to the other that is a generic class now what are the types of automobiles you can have you can have cars you can have trucks you can have buses and there are many other things right so each of them can be considered as an object okay I hope we are clear on what is the databases the types of databases we can have we can have many others many there are various types of databases right now in the market so these are few of them okay so this was where my this is where my data is stored right this is the place next we have the storage area okay this is the storage area dbms lies between the storage area and your front end right so you have the back end here and you have the front end here and this is where your dbm is like lies so what is this it acts as an interface between the database okay which is stored and the applications which you are using to access the database right you can't if you are here right if you are the end user it you are a user here or your application so you're the user you are using this application you can directly access this database you can because data is stored in a very raw format we can't do that it is stored in a very uh in a very mechanical form where you would need machine codes to access obviously we cannot so we have dbms who does this work for us it will know where the data is stored which we want and it will uh pull the data for us okay that is what dbms does so the the interfaces which this dbms can can cat cater to add this C the first is applications okay so for example you are using some SQL MySQL developer or SQL Developer okay or you are using um Microsoft SQL management studio right so those are the applications by which you can access your dbms or evil users who are directly you know accessing dbms so you are using some website uh for example Amazon right and it is accessing the database it's its own in its own database right so that is how you use as an end users or you can also one day VMS can be connected to another dbms so sometimes this is also is needed when you have multiple databases scattered across various places you will need multiple dbms to interact with each other to give the user the data needed right then this applications will come on top of the other dbms okay so this is how your data is stored okay and aho data is accessed using dbms I hope the dbms concept is clear by now so we move on to the next part okay next we'll see what is an ER diagram okay now if you see we spoke about the relational database right which is a relational database management system is a type of dbms with a row based table structure most commercial rdbms uses SQL okay now what is an ear diagram and why are we talking about rdbm is for an ER diagram okay now like I told you rdbms or a dbms okay relational database is nothing but rdbms okay no when we say rdbms if you see we have different tables here if you see we have different tables here and each table is connected to each other okay using a relation okay so for example if you consider this table to be employee and this table to be salary and employee table can be connected to the salary table either using the employee ID or using a department diary for example why I am saying that it can be a case that each department has a specific salary now anyone in the employee table who is working in that department will have that salary right so that is how tables are interconnected to each other okay so this is nothing but a dvms but each of the database is connected or each of the tables are connected to each other using a relation that's why we call this as a relational database management system okay and what is an ER no so now you know why it is called rdbms right we uh previously you know what was dvms then you understood what is rdbms and now we will see what is ER or entity relationship diagram now entity relationship diagram is nothing but well each of the entities on so tables are also called as entities right so each of the entities are connected to each other via relation this is the way I told you like how tables are connected to each other using relation same way entities which are actually nothing but tables they are connected to each other via relation okay so these are ER diagrams when you write multiple tables or multiple objects and you connect each of them with some relation and there can be multiple each table can be connected to multiple tables for example if you see this table this is connected to all these tables using some relations now there can be different kind of relations okay there can be one to one there can be that the four types of relations that can happen in between any tables one to one one to many many to one and many too many okay

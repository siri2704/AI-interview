Hello friends! Welcome to Gate Smashers In this video I am going to explain Constraints in SQL And constraints is an important portion of SQL And this is important in 4 ways First of all If we talk about your college or university level exam It is important for that Second it is important For competitive exams Like GATE, NET, KVS and competitive exam In which there is computer science portion It is important in it Third it is important For your placements Because maximum companies If they ask question on DBMS Then they keep at top priority SQL So SQL basics should be clear to you And 4th this is important For Oracle Certification Means if you want to do OCA certification Then in that SQL  You should know the basic And constraint is a very important portion in it So we will start constraints in SQL So what is the meaning of constraints in actual Constraint means Conditions We are putting restrictions On database Which means in database Before entering data Some condition, some restriction We want to apply After that We want user to add data corresponding to that condition only I am explaining it with a simple real life example As we take example Of gmail Almost everyone has gmail account If you don't have gmail you might be having yahoo mail
We have some mail account Now in mail account When we create username When we create mail id Then I have kept my name in mail id varunsingla@gmail.com When we put varunsingla@gmail.com Then we check Is this mail id Available or not It is not that you will get anything It is possible that this mail id Already someone might have taken So what you will do You will enter varunsingla and check for availability If no one has taken Then it will show you over there It is available If someone has already taken it Then what it will show you That change the name Then you make change in the name Something like your date of birth Or anything You will add something numeric Then what is this You have applied a condition That whenever a new mail if will be created That should be unique That means it should not be duplicate You cannot say That 2 people Have exactly same gmail, of one mail server account Yes it can be of yahoo mail and gmail But if we talk just about gmail Then 2 people Cannot have same gmail mail id Some difference, of dot, slash, some difference Will be there In the same way when we give password What does it show at the time of password That length of the password should be this Means 8 character, 10 character Length should be there Special character should be there Like @, # One numeric should be there Or alphabetical should be there There should be a capital alphabet What is this actually? These are the conditions These are the constraints So that when the use enters data Then the use enters data corresponding to that condition So in SQL also When we create a table When we create a database We want that user it is not that enters any data We will put condition Where we will put the condition? Remember we will put condition On columns Which means, on attributes we will put condition Because if on attributes we put condition Then in the attribute that data will only go Which will fulfill the condition Otherwise that data will not go So in SQL We will start First of all we have Unique constraint Unique With name only we can understand Unique means duplicate is not allowed So any attribute Let's say you have taken attribute mobile number Now you want That your mobile number In your table You have made a table In that table You have made mobile number as unique Now what is the meaning of making mobile number unique That whenever user will enter data in it Then what should be the mobile number It should be unique Means any values cannot exist duplicate In one column Only in that column The column that you are making unique In that all the values will be unique Duplicate is not allowed So this is the simple concept Of unique constraint After that comes Not null What is the meaning of not null What is the meaning of null Null means empty Means value is not available Or it is not applicable Null means Let's suppose over here I want to make it on mobile number We will take some other column Let's say over here I have taken a column Email id Now Email id Let's suppose I have not made not null Then what will happen If user Does not have email id Then he can leave this blank Which means He will not fill this And he will move on the next step But if I have made this not null Then user cannot leave this empty He has to fill something in this Because this null means It cannot be empty In this you will have to put some value Simple example is there When we some form So when we submit Then a red colour start is shown over there What is that It is a mandatory value Which means you will have to fill something in it You cannot leave it empty So that is not null constraint So if you make any column not null Then in that user will have to give value In null sometimes students get confused That null means zero No Zero is also a value Null means We don't have that value What is that value, it is empty That is called a null Not null means it cannot be empty You will have to put something After this third comes Combination of this both Combination of unique and not null Which we call Primary key So what is primary key Unique + not null Means that column In that data will be unique And in that null value is also not allowed Like over here if we talk In employee table Employee id Now employee id Each employee will have employee id And that will be unique And it is not that There is any employee in company Who does not have employee id It can never happen When recruitment will be done At the time of recruitment only You will get employee id And what will be this employee id It will be unique If we talk about student table So students registration number or roll number So each student will have registration number or roll number And it will also be unique So what is it? unique and not null And as it is primary key There is an important concept in database And I have already made full fledge video on it And its link is given in the description box Even in suggested video you will gets its link What is primary key How to we use it I have also explained the programing part in it So you definitely check that video once So that you will have full idea about it Then fourth comes Over here Check constraint What is the meaning of check constraint That before entering the value You have to check Check means let's suppose We have a column age And now in age I can enter any value Let's say I have kept age as int Now user is entering data in this Insert into tablename Values In age he has entered value -10 So is it possible that Age value is -10 No But user can enter He can enter any value Over here we will put check constraint In this way Check Age>18 Means over here we have put a constraint That the age is Should be more than 18 Now whenever user will enter data If user enters let's suppose 10 Then over there error will come 10 value will not go If user enters 20 Then yes, corresponding to check this is fine So this value will go What is the meaning of check If we want to fix something Which we call as domain What is the meaning of domain We want user should from this domain only Which means, from some of these value only User should enter some value Like address I have put check on address On Address let's suppose I am putting check That my address is That either should be delhi Or it should be chandigarh Or let's say it should be mumbai Other than this You don't want any other city as address Means you have fixed the domain That it should be from these 3 cities only So what you should do Put check constraint On address That your address Is either delhi, chandigarh or mumbai  Other then that if the user Enter any other address Than over there some error will be some Along with that only error will be shown That value should be from these 3 only So this is actually concept of check constraint Then 5th we have Over here foreign key concepts Foreign key Foreign key which is also used for referential integrity And foreign key and as I had told primary key I am doing star mark on both of them Because foreign key also Is very important topic of database Foreign key is referential integrity concept That if I have 2 tables So if one table is taking reference from another table Or even if one table is taking reference from itself Then that reference should be proper And I cannot explain it in this video The whole foreign key concept And on this already with example Whole foreign key I have explained In 2 videos And you will get the link in the description box Even you will get in suggested videos So you definitely check foreign key Because foreign is not that they will ask in 1 minute That what is foreign key Foreign key is a full fledge concept And you will get the full concept in that video Concept of foreign key Then last constraint we have Default Default constraint simply means With name only you can understand Default means let's suppose I have a column salary On salary, salary like int and I have made this default And I have given default value 10000 Which means whenever you will insert new value in table So if you are not giving any data to salary You are not inserting any data in salary Then by default what will it take? 10000 it will take If we talk with simple example Like suppose you are going to purchase any watch So by default standard time is 10:10 What is that 10:10 time It is a default time But when you will purchase the watch After that obviously you will set the time Which will be the present time But what is the meaning of default That we give some default value With which I will come to know That in case even if I don't enter data Than this will be the default value in this It will not be empty It will not be empty Some data will be added into this So this is the concept of constraint Unique, not null, primary key, check, foreign key  and default After applying this constraint It is not that you can insert any data in table It restricts you It restricts you that the data That will be inserted Based on these conditions only So any column You can give any value You can even make combination Like if one column only Want to give unique along with that You want to apply check Then that also you can apply And let's suppose If you want to make one as primary key If you want to make foreign key also Then you can apply that also So multiple combinations are possible But all are not possible Like unique and not null If you want to apply both Then what is better You apply primary key Because it is unique and not null both So this flexibility when you are doing coding At that time you will have to check But theoretically we talk Theoretically this is the concept Related to these constraints Thank you

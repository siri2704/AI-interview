hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I'll be covering complete view shopping in dbms I will explain what is view what is simple view what is complex View and also I will explain how to create view update View and delete View guys I have uploaded a complete dbms update tutorials I'll provide a link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started hit Festival explain what is View guys view is nothing but it is simply a virtual table for example it is considered there is college database inside College database there is student table this is showing table data now what I want to do is I want to create this two entable again with the same data so again I need to write code in order to create student table and in order to insert this data so it is time taking process in order to overcome this problem we can use view just by using selectric command you need to select all this data and you need to place the data in view that's view is nothing but it is simply a virtual table for example what I want to do is I want to create the same showing table again with the same data so just by writing single line of code you can create this table so right here create view guys view is nothing but it is simply a virtual Table after writing create view here you need to give view name for example I want to give your name as my view so right here create view of my view which is view name as Now by using select command you need to select data whatever the data that is present in session table I want to place this complete data in my view by using select command you need to select data so right here select star I want to select all these three columns so I written here star so storm in all these three columns from table name I want to select data from student table so right here student and it lasts use semicolon whenever you write this line of code and click enter it will create View that your name is my view here in this my view I selected complete data which is by any student table so this my view contains complete data which is by an instrument table guys this my view is also a table previously there is only one table that is true and table but this time there are two tables they are showing table and as well as my view table whenever you write show tables it will display complete tables which is present in database there are two tables in database so whenever I write this code and click enter it will display two tables they are showing table and next one is my view table I want to see data which is fine in my view table so you need to write code that is Select star from guys in order to see data which is present table you need to write selected star from table name and in order to see data which is written in view you need to write select star from view name I want to see data which is planned in my view table so just write your selected star from my view this my view contains complete data which is present student table so whenever I write your select start from my view it will display this complete table this is my output okay select start from strain main it will select complete data from all these three columns but this time I don't want to select complete data I want to select only data of the students whose section is a your size section is a and Raju section is a and nagendra section is a so I want to select only these three records and I want to create one separate view so I will create one separate view by selecting these three records so write code that is create View and here you need to give your name previously I given view name as my view this time I will give my view name as my view 1. so create view my view 1 as select guys I want to select all these three columns like names I rule number one and section A so right here star select to star from table name my table name is student so right here student and now you need to give condition you can give condition by using where where section equal to a in quotations whenever you write this line of code and click enter it will create view that view name is my view one this my view one contains only data of the students whose section is a your size section is a whenever you write your show tables it will display three tables as output they are student my view and my view one I want to see data which is present in my view one so you need to write code that is Select star from view name that is my view 1 and give semicolon whenever you write this code and click enter this is my output Starman complete columns so it will display complete Columns of the student whose section is a custom and complete three columns but this time I don't want compare three columns I just want to Only Name column and Rule Number column as output I need to skip this section column so I will create view by selecting only two columns they are name column and Rule Number column so I let code for this so right here create View and view name I want to give unim as my view to my view too as select Starman complete columns but I don't want to select complete columns I want to select only name column and Rule Number column so right here so right here select name comma rule number from table name table name is student so right here student whenever you write this code and click enter it will create view that viewername is my view too so whenever you write show tables it will display completely four tables they are showing table my view table my view one table and my view two table this is my output now I want to see data which is present in my view too in order to see data you need to write select star from my view to this is my output it will skip the section column and it will display only name column and Rule Number column so this is my output views are nothing but they are simply a virtual tables a view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database get same like tables views also contain rows and columns based on given condition view can contain all rows or it can also contain only specific rows it all depends on condition till now we created views will explain how to update views for example if you consider my view one this my view one contains complete data of the students whose section is a now I want to update this my view one previously my view One content complete data of the student whose section is a this time I want to update my view 1 by selecting complete data of the students whose section is B so right here by using replace command we can update view so right here replace view view name is my view one as select star from student where section equal to B take B in quotations whenever you write this line of code and click enter now this my V1 contains only section B data If You observe this table in this table only Shiva section is B so it will store Shiva rule number 2 and section B whenever you write select star from iview 1 it will display output that is name Shiva rule number two and section B this is my output by using replace command we can update views guys for example if you consist student table in the student table I change your name PSI to name ABC whatever the changes that you made to this main table automatically these changes are reflected to all these views because we created these three views by using the student table so if you change any data instrument table automatically these changes are updated in all these views so now my view my view 1 and my view too so in all these three views it will update names sorry to name ABC the deleting view is same like deleting table in order to delete table you need to write draft table table name in order to delete view you need to hit drop view of your name I created three views now I want to delete this reviews so right here drop view my view drop view my V1 drop view my view 3. this is how we delete views guys if you create view by selecting only single table then we call it as simple view in this example I created view by selecting only single table that is to end table so if you create view by selecting single table then we call it as simple View if you create view by selecting multiple tables then we call it as complex view I'll give example for example it is considered there are two tables one table is showing table and next table is Branch table now I want to select the name column from this to end table and I want to select a b name column from this Branch table by selecting these two columns I want to create one separate View a red code for this so it first write create view I want to give your name as Mu so create view in view as select guys in order to create view from multiple tables definitely there must be one common column If You observe student table instrument table for Sid column there is one two three similarly in Branch table for bid column there is one two three so in order to create view from multiple table there must be some matching data I want to select name column from student table so right here selector shouldn't which is table name dot column name I want to select name column next I want to select B name column from Branch table so comma branch which is table name dot column name I want to select B name column so right here Branch dot b name I selected two columns one is name column from student table comma B name column from Branch table I selected two columns from two tables so from student comma branch and here you need to give condition where student dot Sid is equal to branch.bad student dot Sid is equal to Branch dot bid and give semicolon here there is match one one so it will select PSI AML and here there is two two there is match so it will select Shiva CSC and there is Match 3 3 it will select Ganesh GS I created view that view name is Mu this is Mu data for example instrument table there is nagendra Phi and Raju one a given condition that is showing dot Sid is equal to branch.bid If You observe this nagendra for nagendra there is Phi in this column Phi is not present so it will not select This Record there is one and here for AML there is one so it will select Raju AML so it will select Raju AML here I created view by selecting multiple tables they are shoe and table and Branch table so we call it as complex view complex view is nothing but creating views from multiple tables this is all about views

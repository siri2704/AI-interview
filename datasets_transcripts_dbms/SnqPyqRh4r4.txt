hey everyone welcome to another video in the mongodb series in today's video we'll understand what exactly mongodb is and what are its key features but before we begin if you haven't subscribed to our channel already make sure to hit the subscribe button and the bell icon to never miss an update now i'm sure you must have heard about databases but mongodb is a popularly used not only sql database now without further delay let's begin and understand what exactly mongodb is so here's what's in store for you first we'll understand what mongodb is then we'll understand why exactly mongodb is used then we understand the characteristics of mongodb after that we'll understand the working of mongodb and how it functions we'll also look at some of the commonly used applications of mongodb and finally we look at the top companies that readily deploy mongodb so what exactly is mongodb it is a document oriented nosql database it was initially released in august 27 2009. mongodb replaces the concept of rows of conventional relational data models with something called as documents it offers developers the flexibility to work with evolving data models since it's document based mongodb allows embedded documents arrays and represents complex hierarchical relationships using a single record it is also schema free which means that the keys defined in the document are not fixed as a result massive data migrations can be ruled out but you must be wondering when there's something like sql why is nosql or mongodb used there are a few reasons why mongodb is widely used first up is flexibility mongodb's notion of documents that can contain sub-documents nested in complex hierarchies is really expressive and flexible flexible query model a user can selectively index some part of a document or a query based on attribute values regular expressions or ranges next up is native aggregation native aggregation allows its users to extract and transform data from mongodb and either load them in a new format or export it from mongodb to other data sources it makes it extremely compatible lastly as mentioned earlier the schema free model now applications get the power and responsibility to interpret different properties in different ways now that you know what mongodb is and why exactly it's used let's have a look at the characteristics of mongodb firstly it's a general purpose database now mongodb can serve heterogeneous loads and multiple purposes within an application again it has a flexible schema design document-oriented approaches with non-defined attributes that can be modified on the fly is a key contrast between mongodb and any other relational database next up is scalability and load balancing it's built to scale both vertically but most importantly horizontally using sharding and architect can share load between different instances and achieve both read and write scalability when it comes to load balancing this happens automatically and transparently to the user by the shard balancer again we have aggregation framework now mongodb offers an extract transform and load framework that eliminates the need for complex data pipelines native replication now data will get replicated across a replica set without complicated setup security features both authentication and authorization are taken into account in mongodb next up is json now json is widely used across the web for front end and api communication and as such it's easier when the database is also compatible with the same protocol lastly we have mapreduce now again mapreduce is an excellent tool to build data pipelines and mongodb uses mapreduce readily now let's quickly have a look at the working of mongodb data is stored in documents with the help of key value pairs now the data is stored in the bs1 format at the back end mongodb converts json data into a binary format known as bson mongodb also makes provision for nested data now all of these documents are stored in a collection these collections hold multiple documents and since mongodb is schema-less the documents in one collection need not be similar now again these collections are stored in the entire mongodb database as mentioned earlier mongodb makes provision for nested data this makes fetching of data extremely efficient when compared to other databases now you must be wondering where exactly mongodb can be applied or used so let me help you with that several areas of technologies use mongodb as their dbms currently some of them are internet of things mobile applications real-time analysis personalization catalog management and content management now all said and done let's look at some of the companies that use mongodb currently companies like toyota sap astrazeneca adobe verizon cisco barclays and google among others readily deploy mongodb as their database management system so with that we come to the end of the session on what is mongodb now this was just an overview of what exactly the database management system does however if you want to learn mongodb in depth then watch out for more videos from us thank you so much for being here keep learning and

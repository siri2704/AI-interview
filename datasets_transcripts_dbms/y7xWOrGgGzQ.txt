hi in this video we will talk about dbms so what is dbms dbms means database management system so as part of this video we will talk about data so what when you talk about the data we need to talk about what is database what is database management and what is database management system so we'll talk about all these things in this video so let's go to The Next Step so here I have something so I'm saying something I'm not saying data I'm not saying information so I have something so what is that something I have here 100 Krishna email gmail.com and a big number okay so this is also a number this is also a number these are all strings or you say sequence of characters whatever you want okay so what is this 100 so when you when you look at into this 100 what is this 100 is this a age of a person or any product price $1 or 100 rupees what is this 100 so Krishna means what is this is the name of any person we don't know so what is this email this email is related to your personal email ID or your professional ID we don't know so what is this big number what kind of number it is so when you look into this we cannot say that what is this so potentially it should become a data okay it's a data but how it will become a data so now you see some meaningful thing again so 100 is an ID Krishna is a name email is official email and this number big number is credit card number so still what is this information or what is this thing these things okay so these are all related to an employee okay so this one employee ID is 100 name is Krishna this employee name is Krishna this employee official email is email gmail.com this employee credit card number is from this number so now you can see a meaningful information means what is this 100 this 100 is a particular employee ID which employee krishna's ID what is this email this is krishna's email and what is this email is Krishna is an employee so it is an official email so now you can able to get some meaningful data okay now this 100 is a data now what kind of data this is ID of employee this Krishna is also a data what kind of data that is name of an employee what is this email official email of particular employee something like that so in this is employee is an entity here employee is an entity here ID is this particular entity's attribute and this 100 is exact value okay so employee is an entity this entity has different attributes what are those ID name official email credit card number and each attribute has its value ID is 100 name is Krishna official email is email gmail.com and the credit card number is big number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91 011 21 something like that okay so then what is entity what is attribute what is value and what exactly data is now okay the data is now I'm saying this 100 is data Krishna is data this email is data right so now the data is value of an attribute of an entity that represent real world fact okay so this this is the data this data is value of this attribute of this employee entity okay data is value of an attribute of an entity that represents real world fact okay so then what do you mean by entity so there is a typo it is not entity it is entity okay so what do you mean by entity so in the context of a database an entity is a distinct object concept or a thing that is represented in the database and can be distinguished from other objects okay so in the database context it is a distinct object and that can be distinguished from other objects it is typically a noun or noun phrase that represents a real world object or a set of related objects okay so by taking one example we'll see for example in a database for a university an entity could be a student so if you're talking about talking about a university database so in that a possible entity could be a student a course a professor a department a building here entity means it might be a student a course a professor a department or a building so each entity represented by a set of attributes or properties that describe the characteristics of that uh are qualities of that entity okay so each entity will have some characteristics those are called attributes so for instance a student entity might have attributes so if you have a student is an entity it definitely have some attributes okay what are those attributes might be his name his student ID his address his date of birth these are all attributes of a particular entity that is student here okay so then what is attribute in a database an attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity such as a column in a table okay column in a table okay table consist of columns and rows right a column represents an if a table is an entity that column is an attribute okay so that we'll see in our next videos it describes a specific aspect or feature of the entity being represented it describes a specific aspect of feature of the entity being represented for example in a database for a store an entity could be a product in in our previous example we have seen entity is University here I'm taking a store as a database so if it if that is an entity if that is a database The Entity is a product here okay so and the attri attributes of that entity could be include this product name this product price this product description and who manufactured that product and stock keeping unit number so these are all different attributes of that entity in a database okay so this is called attribute attribute means characteristics of a entity now what is the value in a database a value is the actual data you see that value is the actual sorry value is the actual data that is what we have seen in the previous slide rate data is value of an attribute of an entity that represents real world fact okay here value is the actual data that is stored in a specific attribute of an entity cor right so when you see 100 I don't know what is 100 know it is a value of this ID attribute of an employee entity then it became a meaningful real world data okay so stored in a specific attribute of entity it represents a specific instance or piece of information that is associated with a particular entity and attribute for example if the entity is a customer and now I'm taking entity as a customer customer is an entity here and the attributes is customer's name and the value of that attribute for a particular customer could be John Smith right this is the value customer is an entity customer name is an attribute of this entity and the value of that name is I'm Tak taking an example of John Smith okay so this is the value actual data similarly if the attribute is the customer age that is one of the attributes and then the value of the attribute of a particular customer could be example 35 this 35 age of this customer so now this 35 is a meaningful data okay so this is all about value so you have some data here okay phone number Name ID name official email official email credit card number something like that okay so this also phone number so here let's take an example you are working in a there is an there is an organization it has some employees that organization asking employees can you provide this information your ID your name your official email your phone number okay so if they're asking this this data so can you expect everybody will give the information the same format and same uh what you say like sequence so there is no possibility okay there's there's a less probability for that so if you have 100 employe one employee will give his name first ID second mail third and phone number last so there might be a shuffling so one person will give name email phone number then at last ID so if that is the case then it is difficult to analyze the data and store the data so then you need a organized data so for that you'll use some database here employee so here you mention that I need information in this form first I want ID then name then official email then phone number if you get the information in this format it is easy to organize it easy to analyze something like that whatever you want to do okay so this is organized data this is unorganized they can give any any order if they Prov provide in any order it is difficult to analyze the data okay so then this is called database employes a database so database means well organized data so database refers to a collection of related data that is organized in a structured format and stored in a computer system so related data so here the all these these attributes mean ID name official email phone number are related to this employee I'm not providing something else which is not related to employee okay so database means database refers to a collection of related data that is organized in a structured format and stored in a computer system so if you store something like this what is the advantage just now we are discussing right we need to analyze or something like that so data consistency and integrity data sharing and accessibility efficient data storage and retrieval data security data backup and Recovery data analysis and Reporting so if you have a organized data you can perform all these things okay you can perform all these things so that is the advantage of database database means well organized data if you have well organized data you can retrieve the data you can store the data efficiently uh just an example okay go to the database management okay so database management refers to the process of organizing storing retrieving updating and maintaining data in database okay with the help of database management you will organize the data you can store the data you can retrieve the data you can update the stored data and you can maintain the data in a database so for that there should be a system database management system system means set of rules to follow so ensure data validation sharing of data concurrency control sharing of resources ensuring data consistency so if you have set of rules you can provide the proper information so ensure data validation uh if you take an example of that id id should be a number I cannot store in the ID from h n d r e d something like that 100 okay so 101 something like that I can store okay that's how you can do validation means it should accept only integer values not the character or characters or strings so that kind of uh rules you can uh put on that particular database and you can follow those then you'll have a you can store proper information inside that okay so now what is database sorry now that what is database management system now so a database management system is a software application that manages and organizes data stored in a database it provides tools for creating updating querying and maintaining a database a database management system is used to ensure data integrity and security as well as to optimize the storage and retrieval of data so with the help of database management system it's a kind of tool with the help of the tool you can perform all these things what we discussed till now what is that creating updating querying maintaining all these things so the database is where the actual data is stored database means it's a store you can store somewhere your data that is called database the dbms acts as an intermediary between the database and the application providing tools for interacting with the data okay the dbms acts as an intermet between the your database and the application providing tools for interacting with the data okay so you have some data stored somewhere and your application needs very specific information so very specific means uh if you go back to this simple table so I want I want name of the name of a particular person whose ID is 100 I'm putting some condition I don't want all the information I want only a person whose ID is 100 then how you can retrieve the data this is database you organized data well organized you stored somewhere but how to retrieve the particular information so with the help of dbms tools you can perform those kind of operations okay so what are the examples of dbms there are a number of tools are available in the market but I just uh listed here only few which are very famous MySQL Microsoft SQL Server sqlite mongodb Oracle database post SQL something like that okay so as part of this video series we'll use MySQL and we'll create the database we'll retrieve the data all these things we'll see with the help of myosu okay so this is all about dbms okay thank you for watching this video please like the

[Music] another namaskaram welcome back to bombsy bonnie so eval t video we will discuss the first constraint which is domain constraints okay domain constraints because it's a kind of uh tricky topic okay monkey a schema should always be fixed okay ante it should not be changing should not be changing okay until basically schema and basically it is a set of attributes let's say okay classroom classroom table or classroom relation okay now what we can have okay serial number under you okay name then what do we have roll number marks phone number whatever okay you put in basic point indian [Music] 25 24 23 20 okay phone number you should know some number for some phone number someone number some phone number before moving forward an academy all star in a batch electrical branch 2023 11th february starting in the so you can check it out in the phone number contact yes now they'll give you all details again all star batch gate 20 23k but this time for easy bilingual batch again 11th february again as you can see there's a number on the screen necessary sitting on if you want to test your implementation skills do check it out and this time there's a big scholarship pool as well 12th and 13th if you want to find the analysis and academic tool i mean the correct solutions expedited cut off and all you can watch it there okay iconic subscription there will be one to one live mentorship and i mean if you are basically having any doubt you can have one to one connect and practice individual small attributes like first name middle name and last name okay so what will happen there has to be what different number of attributes so name another m because system okay we'll completely remove it and then three different attributes break just okay so it will be first name middle name and last name separately all the attributes should be atomic atomic under nd they should not be i mean breakable phone number is not directly attributed i mean not directly atomic so let's take phone number one second so phone number and attribute just remember let's take some phone number for example plus nine one one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one four it is not atomic but indiana assumption is that everybody is from the same country 911 got it so that is what is the domain constraint okay so yeah i hope it was helpful and understood so we'll discuss the next constraint which is key constraint in the next video thank you very much [Applause] let

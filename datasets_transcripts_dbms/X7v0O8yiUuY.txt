[Applause] [Music] thank you hello Mighty Tech users I hope you all are doing fine you all must have heard about the words database and database management system today's video is to give you an idea about data database and database Management Systems before moving on to what is database I would like to tell you a little bit about data so what is data the word data is originated from the word datum that means single piece of information it is plural of the word datum in simple words data can be facts related to any object in consideration for example your name age height weight Etc are some data related to you computer data is information processed or stored by a computer this information may be in the form of text documents images audio clips software programs or other types of data computer data may be processed by the computer's CPU and is stored in files and folders on the computer's hard disk a picture image file PDF Etc can also be considered data at its most rudimentary level computer data is a bunch of ones and zeros known as binary data because all computer data is in binary format it can be created processed saved and stored digitally this allows data to be transferred from one computer to another using the network connection or various media devices it also does not deteriorate over time or lose quality after being used multiple times so now you know that what is data now we will move on to what is database a database is a systematic collection of data they support electronic storage and manipulation of data databases make data management easy you can organize data into tables rows columns and index it to make it easier to find relevant information database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users the main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing retrieving and managing data there are many Dynamic websites on the worldwide web nowadays which are handled through databases for example a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel it is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database let us discuss another database example an online telephone directory uses a database to store data of people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider uses a database to manage billing client related issues handle fault data Etc let us also consider Facebook it needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisements and a lot more we can provide a countless number of examples for the usage of databases there are many databases available like MySQL cybase Oracle mongodb and formix postgresql SQL Server Etc modern databases are managed by the database management system or dbms we will discuss more about databases and the database Management Systems in upcoming videos If you want to get a summary of data science in Big Data then we have dedicated two entire videos for both you can check them out by clicking

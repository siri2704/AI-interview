welcome to my video series of database management system in this video you will be learning about er model or er diagram this is my fourth video on er model in the first video i have created a detailed video on what is an er model why we need the ear model and what are the different shapes by using which we can get the ear diagram in second video i have talked about in detail what is an entity and what are the different types of entity in the third video i have given the detailed description and i have given the explanation about the what is an attribute and the types of attribute now in this video i will be talking about this is a lecture 4 on er model in this video i will be talking about the relationship in er diagram so relationship is a one of the component of er diagram what was the two more the first was entity next is attribute and this is the last component of er diagram that is relationship so in this video you will be learning about what is a relationship types of relationship with an example so i request you please stay tuned till the end of this video please subscribe to my channel like and share this video thank you [Music] in this video of my er model the lecture 4 i will be teaching you what is an er model with example the components of er model what are the different components the components entity attribute and relationship this video is purely based on the last component of er diagram that is relationship component so i will be telling you more in detail about what is in relationship and types of relationship with example so let's start let's see what is an er model or what is an er diagram both are same er model er model stands for entity relationship model entity relationship model entity is an real world object relationship how the real world objects are having a relationship among themselves in a database so this model is used to define the data elements and their relationship for a specific system for example i have a company of some production i have some production company so the in that production company i will be having different departments on the different data elements so how these data elements will be communicating among themselves will be specified in our database model the er model defines the conceptual view or design or blueprint of a database conceptual view or design or blueprint it means that before creation of a database before creation of a database will be having how the database look like how the database look like how the different elements of a database will be communicating so detail in detail that the er model will define everything how our data elements will be having a relationship so it is a high level data model er model is a high level data model used to model logical view of the system from data perspective from data perspective what is a data perspective how the data should be visible how the data should be visible how the data should be communicating how the data will be communicating with other data so it's a high level data model purely based upon data perspective having below components what are these components entities one component entity type is one component and entity set so in detail i will be telling about what is an entity what is an entity type what are entity sets so in er modeling database structure is portraited as a diagram called entity relationship diagram whenever we are going to create a model conceptual view it's nothing but a diagram so that diagram is going to portray the basic structure how our database look like however database look like an entity relationship model that is er model describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram which is known as relationship diagram that is er diagram er modeling helps you to analyze data requirement systematically to produce well designed database so without er modeling we cannot create a database it will help us to analyze the data requirement systematically to analyze the data data requirement systematically and based upon our analysis we can produce well designed database as per the requirement so let's see this example of er diagram let's consider i have a table student table so physical table i have a student table wherein i have stu columns or the field name such as student role number student name and its phone number let's consider i have another table college where i have the fields such as college code college address and phone number now how these two tables are in relation as we know students will enroll into the college will enroll into the college for to learn some course so we can say student studies in college we can say student studies in college so studies will be the relationship between student table and college table so this is an table representation let's consider the same thing with our er model representation diagrammatical representation student table so here student table will be called as student entity in relationship model that is er model so student is an entity having the attributes student role number student name and student phone number so all these are attributes of our student entity and i have a college entity the attributes of college entity is college court college address and college phone number all these are its college entity attributes so this is my student entity and college entity in the above you can see student table and college table so in er diagram will be having entities so student entity and college entity so student entity having its own attributes college entity is having its own attributes now what is our relationship the relationship is student is going to study in college student studies in the college so studies will be the relationship between student and college so this is a basic example of our er diagram let's see the components of er model so what are the different components so in er model we we have seen entity attributes and relations so these three are our major components these three are our major components of er model so what are these components entity attribute and relationship so every entity will be having attributes what is an attribute it's a characteristics of an entity characteristics of an entity so i have three components of er model that is entity attribute and relationship so let's see this entity so entity is of two types strong entity and weak entity strong entity and weak entity attribute so attribute will be of four types first key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute and derived attribute next coming to relationships i will be having uni unitary relationship binary relationship and enri relationship with respect to this relationship i will be having the cardinality constraints such as one to one one too many many too many many to one so all these are my cardinality constraints with respect to my relationships such as unreal binary and henry let's see the last component of er diagram or the er model that is relationship what's the relationship the association among different entities is called as a relationship is called as an relationship in our er model so we'll be having different entities in an entity set how these entities will be having an association among themselves will be defined as an relationship will be defined as an relationship so we will be having an relationship set up so what is in relationship set we will be having similar kind of similar kind of entities in an relationship set for example if i have a education institute in an education institute i will be having a faculties students and courses all these are three different type of entities of having the same subject concept that is education so if i have a relationship among this all it will be called as a relationship set they are of similar type next we have the degree of relationship next we have the degree of relationship the number of participating entities in a relationship defines the degree of relationship such as unreal binary and entry so unity means only one entity will be there in relation next binary two entities will be there in a relation n remains more than two that is three or four entity sets or entities will be there in a relationship next we have the mapping cardinalities mapping cardinalities cardinality means how many times a one particular entity can be in association with other entity for example one entity can participate or have a relationship with another entity one time or two time or many times for example a student can enroll into multiple courses so it means one too many right next a student can opt for a single university so student is in one entity university is one entity so one two one so like this cardinality is going to define how many number of times an entity is going to be in association with some other entities so relationship so relationship is of three types unreal pantry and entry unity means degree is one binary means degree is two entry means depends upon the how many types of how many different entities are they unreal means only one entity will be in relation boundary means two entities and that means more than two so next we have the cardinalities in cardinalities we'll be having one to one one too many many to one many too many so this is called as my cardinality constraints in each relationship in each relationship so let's see the first relationship unit relationship then there is only one entity set participating in a relation then that relationship is called as human relationship is called as unreal relationship for example one person marries to one person okay one person is going to married to another person so one two one so one person marries to another person so this is person marriage to person so it's a usual relationship it's a younger relationship next we have banner relationship when there are two entities sets participating in a relation the relationship is called as binary relationship boundary relationship for example student enrolled in a course student enrolled in a course so student is in one entity courses and one entity so these two are two different entity types or set so student is going to enroll for one each course so one student will be enrolling for a course so it means enroll is an relationship which is of binary two different entities are there in a relationship so one is student entity another is course entity so this type of relationship is called as binary relationship having two entities in a relationship of enroll next we have android relationship when there are n entities it means more than two entities participating in a relation the relationship is called enri relationship where we will be having more than two entities as you can see i have entity one entity two entity three entity four so all these four entities are in some relation so this type of relationship is called as android relationship wherein we will be having more than two entity sets are in relation next we have the cardinality constraints what's in cardinality constraint cardinality constraint is going to define how many times one entity can participate in an relationship can participate in a relationship so first type we have is one two one cardinality first we have is one to one cardinality when each entity when each entity in each entity set can take part only once in the relationship the cardinality is one to one cardinality the cardinality will be one-to-one cardinality let's assume if female can marry to a male a female can marry to a male right so the relationship will be one to one one female or one male can marry right so here i have a relationship between two different entities that is male and female so male marries to female a female marriage to male right so this is a one to one cardinality relationship this is one to one cardinality relationship so it means both of them both these entities can participate in the relationship only once in this relationship only once so this type of cardinality is called as one two one cardinal next cardinality we have is many to one cardinality in this one particular entity can participate in a relationship multiple times whereas other entity will be taking part only once only once in a relationship so i will be explaining you with an example here for example i have a student entity set and a course entity set let's consider this course is provided from the university is provided from the university so and students we have so one individual student can participate into one single course so like this i will be having multiple students i will be having student s1 s2 s3 s4 so it means many students many students will be enrolling for a single course that is mba so this type of enrollment or the association the association or the relationship is enrolled so many students can enroll for single course this type of cardinality is called as many to one cardinality so n number of students will be enrolling for single course a number of different students will be enrolling for different course this type of cardinality is called as many to one cardinality next we have many too many cardinality within wherein for whatever the number of entities we have all the entities or number of entities will be participating or will be having an association in relationship multiple times multiple times i will be explaining you this with an example i have a student entity and a course entity for example i am having my own private institute wherein i will be having different courses wherein i will be having different courses right private institute i am having varying different courses i will be having so the number of students will be more alright so i am taking different students from s1 to s4 so likewise i will be having different courses such as c c java c sharp web technologies different courses i will be having so students will be enrolling for different courses so it means that a one particular institute one particular student can enroll for two or more than two courses or or two student can enroll for same course vice versa right so there is no restriction of enrollment of students from codes or course to student so n number of times student can enroll to different courses same courses on different courses or combination of courses so this type of cardinality is called as many-to-many cardinality relationship this type of cardinality relationship is called as many-to-many cardinality relationship let's see the quick recap of this session what's an er model air model defines a conceptual view or a design or a blue plane of a given database so before creation of a database we have to go for the any model the model which we are talking here is er model so er model is a conceptual view or a blueprint of a database how our database will look like so in this we will be having three components entity attributes and relationship so what's an entity an entity is a real world thing or object can easily identify like person place or a concept what's an attribute attributes are nothing but the characteristics of these entities every person will have a name age gender like this every place will be located somewhere having its own attribute in the concept also we will be having a different attributes so words and attributes attributes are the descriptive properties which are owned by each entity of an entity set so each entity will be having its own attribute next we have the relationship next we have the relationship the association among entities is called relationship is called relationship so in quick recap let's see the components of er diagram the components of ear diagram are three entity attributes and relationships coming to entity entities are of two types strong entity and weak entity strong entity and weak entity strong entity will be having and no key attribute in that that is primary key whereas weak entity will not have primary key in it as well as weak entity always depends on strong entity whenever it is there in an schema or a entity set next we have attributes in attributes we have key attribute composite attribute multivalued attribute derived attribute what's the key attributes key attributes is nothing but a primary key attribute next composite attributes is a combination of some other attributes such as address address is a combination of street door number locality district state country like this so address will be a composite attribute multivalued attribute is nothing but a phone number a person can have multiple phone numbers so multi-validated derived attribute is an age on the basis of date of birth we can derive the each so age is an derived attribute next we have the relationship in relationship we have three types unreal binary and entry unity means only one entity set will be in n relationship binary means two entity set will be there in a relationship and entry means more than two so these are nothing but a degree of relationship as well so to have this we will be having a cardinality constraints cardinality constraint will define how many number of times one entity set can take part into an relationship with some other entity set so cardinality will be having one to one cardinality one to many cardinality many to one cardinality and many to many cardinalities so these are nothing but our cardinality constraints so in coming video i will be discussing more in detail about different concepts of database management system thanks for watching this video thank you please subscribe to my channel like and share my video thank you

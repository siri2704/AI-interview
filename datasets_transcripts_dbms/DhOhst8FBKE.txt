hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channnel I am R Kumari and I'm back with another video of the dbms series so in this video we would be knowing about relationships then the degree then what are the types of relationship like weak relationship strong relationship then cardinality in relationship and much more things so without any further delay let's get started so what is relationship in ER model in the very start I explained now ER model basically stands for entity relationship model and from the word it is very clear entity relationship so basically relationships among the entities is displayed in ER model now what is the relationship among entities so consider that there is a entity called as person okay so now person may work in some company okay so there are two entities first one is person and second one is company now the relationship among person and the company that is work is called as relationship so basically association between two entities or connection between two entities is called as relationship so relationship in ER model is the connection between two entities tables based on the related data so person is the first entity so entity we generally display it using a rectangle now there is a relationship so relationship would display using uh Diamond that is works and then there is one more entity that is company so basically person works for company these two are entities and this is the relationship between two entities okay now let's see at the term what is the types of relationship so basically like uh types of attributes and types of entity in types of entity we got to know more about strong entity and weak entity in the same way here also strong relationship and weak relationship exist so let's see that what is strong relationship and what is weak relationship so first we'll start with the strong relationship now what is a strong relationship a strong relationship exist when two entities are highly dependent on each other and one entity cannot exist without the other so basically a strong relationship is established between two person when they are inseparable right so in simpler terms that when two people are inseparable they have a strong relationship and when they can be separated somehow they have a relation but they can be separated is called as weak relationship so in this case strong relationship is when an entity is highly dependent on on another entity and cannot exist without another entity that is called a strong relationship now here I have taken an example of customer and order so okay so basically there is a customer and there is a order now uh every customer places some order right so every order is placed by a customer now in customer there would be some attributes such as customer ID customer name customer address and much more right and Order Also may have some uh attributes such as order uh description order ID and much more okay so what happens is ke for every customer there is a order right so for every customer for every customer ID there is a order which exist in this particular table now what will happen when I delete this customer table so there would be some customer IDs present but these customer IDs does not exist because the table does not exist so in the very starting of the video I explained about primary key foreign key relationship so basically in this customer table the attribute CID is acting as a primary key and in this order table CID is also present and it is acting as a foreign key which is taking a reference from the primary key of another table that is the customer table so they have a relationship established between them now what if I I delete this customer table so all the customer details would be gone all the customer IDs would be gone now here from this customer ID this table is taking reference from this particular table but since this customer ID is deleted or this customer table which is having a customer ID is deleted it won't be able to take a reference so they both are dependent on each other so basically the one which is having a primary key is called as parent and the one which is having a foreign key which is taking a reference from its parent is called as child so basically here the child has a foreign key here the parent has a a primary key the child is having a foreign key which depends on the primary key of parent so if the parent is deleted the primary key of parent is deleted then the child won't be able to take any reference from the parent and it will uh result in the referential Integrity uh rules breaking I made a video on the same that how the rules are breaken in referential integrity and how we can achieve that referential Integrity is also there so referential Integrity rule would be broken so in this way a relationship couldn't be established so this is called a strong relationship strong relationship means something which is inseparable so when two entities depend on each other for their existence is called a strong relationship Whenever there is anything which happens to one table it affects the other table now the second is the weak relationship again I told ke strong relationship is something where things are inseparable it it couldn't be separated but in Weak relationship we can and try to separate them it won't affect much okay so a weak relationship on another hand exist when two entities are related but one entity can exist without the other so whenever there is a use case when one entity can exist without the another entity that is a weak relationship let's understand from an example so here I have taken two entities the first entity is order the second entity is order item now order is having a order ID is primary key order item is having a order ID as foreign key which is taking reference from the order table now order item also have a order item id which is a primary key in this order item so basically consider that this is a order item table and this is the order table now order table has order ID order name order description and order item is having order item id oh IID so just make it o IID order item id order ID which is basically taking a reference from this table which is called as foreign key in this table and consider order item name okay so now this particular order item ID is acting as a primary key here so basically order ID is a primary key in the order table which is a parent table an order item ID has order item id as the primary key sorry for confusing with the words so order ID order ID is a primary key in order table and order item ID is the primary key in order item table so basically this is also having a primary key this is also having a primary key now there could be chances now you place a order and Order item details and everything is attached to that particular order but order item is something which can exist independently as well like there might be some products in uh backlog or there might be some products which is not yet bought by you so there are order items so basically order item is something which can exist independently even if there is no order table so a weak relationship is a relationship where the two entities are related but one entity can exist without the other so basically order it item can exist without order but yeah at the time of making order whenever a customer places the order the order item are attached to that particular order but before placing of that order the order item can exist independently so this is weak relationship strong relationship when things are binded can can't be uh separated uh weak relationship things can be separated but they somehow have a relationship between them now what is degree in dbms so a degree in dbms refers to the number of attributes or columns that a relation or table has so basically the number of attributes your entity is having is called as degree it's degree so consider that there is a customer table now customer may have some attributes customer ID customer name customer uh adhar details so the degree is three so basically the number of attributes or the number of columns in a relation or in a table is called as degree now here is the type of degree so degree is one the name we told it as is a unary degree and a relationship with a single attribute is called as uh having a unary degree or degree 1 now degree 2 is called as binary degree and a relationship with two attributes is called as binary degree now uh degree with three is called as tary degree and a relationship with three attributes is called as tary degree a degree of n is n array degree and a relationship with more than three attributes is n degree where n is greater than three null value so in dbms a null value can occur for various reasons not needed information Sometimes some details are asked but they don't apply to everyone for instance asking for a spouse name for someone who isn't married so basically what is null value in dbms so uh you might have seen many places or whenever we create some tables we give that this can be null or this can't be null so uh some of the attributes we give that this can be null or this is optional so consider that student is uh filling Adar card details or pan card details it's not possible that each and every student would be having a pan card so we can't make that particular column a mandatory or we can't make that particular column not null because null values can exist in the same way there is some not needed information so basically consider that you are being asked your spouse name but you aren married you are a single person so you won't fill any data so that particular data would be filled with null value now here are the instances that why null value basically is used or what could be the simple use cases why the null value exist so the uh first use case is not needed information so whenever there is a not needed information we can use the null value now second is get the don't know the answer every now or then we are asked a question but we don't know an answer yet so you may have dealed this in day-to-day life that you are asked a question and and you simply blank out because you don't know the answer so in that particular case also null value can exist so there are some hypothetical questions which are being asked ke do you think uh bird can fly walk cry eat at the same time so again it's a very lame example but again there are some questions about which you don't know the answer so you can put it as null so basically uh null value can come in that place as well so the third thing is for God to fill in like when you are filling out a form and you accidentally misp putting in some important information so what happens now whenever we are filling a form there are some uh Fields marked with asteris that these particular fields are required field but there are some fields which are not marked with that so what values would be filled for that particular field so their null value can exist so sometimes you are being asked that uh uh what previous inm ships you did but you didn't did any internship so in that case you uh make that value or make that feeli null like you leave that so null is automatically put into that so uh this was all about uh relationships in database degrees in database and then what is the importance of null value how the occurrence of null value takes place and much more things we will be discussing about cardinality and then types of relationship one to one one to many many to one and many to many in next video so this was all about this video If you like this video please hit the like button if you're someone who is new to my channel and looking

Dear student, welcome to Gate Smashers In this video I'm going to explain RAID That is redundant array of independent Disk or redundant array of inexpensive disk So guys here I'll discuss about different RAID levels with real life examples So this video from competitive exams point of view, for college and university and for interviews is very important So guys so like the video and subscribe the channel if you havn't done and if you have done so do subscribe from other other device Subscriber are very important lets start first of all here we are writing Redundant array redundant means redundant means copy it means duplicacy means multiple copies of 1 thing so here reduntdancy duplicacy that is of that is of disk and why we're using disk we're using disk for storing the data so we are storing data in disk that disk is independent lets say if I've 5 disk and array mean that we don't have 1-2 disk but we've multiple disk so this disk first this is independent it means it is not like that if 1 is closed then rest will also get automatically closed, there is no dependency between them and second why it is called inexpensive because if we talk about memory hierchary it is said that register are very much expensive then cash then RAM So somewhere this memory are more costly but we talk about disk So disk at this time, its cost is less and even gradually it is getting decrease when you've purchased your laptop so you also have seen that first there is 256 and then there 512 GB then 1 TB and now a days if you buy a normal laptop theres is by default 1TB is coming it may be like you can take 2 TB in future also So it mean that we're using indepentent and inexpensive disk we're using for storing the data but why we're doing what is need of this, this is the first question that arise So guys whenever we think of company or organsition point of view so we need 2 things first is performance performance in case of read and write means you from data you want to read  data, want to read data from disk and write means want to change data in disk some transaction has changed something you want Read and Write to be fast so you want performance Second you want security avialability that data should be avaialalbe 24*7 and its real life example I'll give to you you have heard fews days ago that facebook, whatapp and insta was down for 6-7 hours and you might have heard this also and because of that Mark zuckerberg income how much loss does he faced he faced 7 billion loss 7 billion dollar loss from 3rd place he has shifted to 5th place only becasue of 6-7 hours services were down and what is there in that services what we do in whatsapp sharing data only what is there in facebook our profile and friends profile that is also data and if we talk about instagram in that also there is only photos and videos, that is also data only so it is dealing with data only and only because of this small down so because of that there is 7 billion of loss so guys thats why companies want there data should be 24*7 available and if is not available it would be great loss for company so that loss can be in term of money also and it can be in term of cerdibility also means trust of them I'll give one more example of this if you've heard about telegram So telegram in only those 6-7 hours 60-70 millions accounts has been added when facebook and all were down that 6-7 hours 60-70 new accounts has been created So see one compant faced a good benefit and another one has faced loss and only because of avaialbity and performance so lets start, so you understood storty that why we are using and what is its purpose So we'll talk anout different levels So in Raid we've diffrenet levels that how we are keeping the data So first level in this is RAID 0 What we do in it data stripping means we are breaking data, breaking data in pieces and keep in different disk like you can see in diagram that in RAID 0, original data that I've lets say it is A B,C,D means you can put data in this way what I did, I broke A in A1 and A2 B into B1 and B2 means you can do mutiple pieces also but if you see in  simple diagram So I break A1 into A1 and A2 then on A3 and A4 and A5 and A6 I mean to say that breaking data in pieces and keeping that data in different disk so what is the use of this its benefit is performance RAID 0 gives us performance because if you want to read, you want to read data of A so parallelly you can read the data from both as it is independent disk parallelly you can read data from this So your performance will be fat same if you want write(B) you want change something in A7 and in A8 so both write will be parallelly so this give high performance and throughput RAID 0 So remember this point then so it can be asked from you that next level is RAID 1 What is purpose of RAID 1, it is called mirroring as RAID 0 is called data stripping here it is called mirroring here we are not breaking data same data copy is shifting to another disk means I've a data A,B,C I've made a mirror of that, mirror means like there is mirror image copy of that data is kept on another disk also So you will ask sir it will cost a lot cost is there but again inexpensive disk means we're choosing that disk or memory whose price is not that much high we are not using ssd, cash, RAM we 're using that disk whose performance is also good and price is also not that much high So we're keeping multiple copies so you got its simple advantage it is not pointing out on performance here it talks about availability data security lets say if one disk failed still I can access that data because in other disk that work is going this is 2 simple example companies keep 3-4 mirrors and distribute in whole globe if there is problem in one geographical area So it can fetch data from different geographical area but idea must have clear from here So mirroring work is to secure data in a way in case of failure we can access data from another and in case if this is coming in your mind that if both disk fails So guys there is no solution of this, you can give 10 mirrors then also you can say and what if 10 mirror fails so that is a worst case but still we are reducing the probability if failure occurred whether I'll able to access my data or not so we are increasing its probability that yes I can still access my data so we're improving that thing so this is combination means here you can see RAID 1+0 at same places 1+0 can also be written so we don't call it 10 it is not 10 but is 1+0 1+0 means we've mix 1 and 0 So 0+1 can also be written on 1+0 also but what we did in 1+0 that data is here mirrored also and along with this it is striped also see A1 and  A2 means we break the data also, original data was A it is broken in 2 parts A1 and A2 and kept a copy of that also and its further part also made A3 and A4 and kept a copy of that, means stripping is also done like data is broken and mirroring also thatâ€™s why we say nested raid because both combination and it is advantageous very useful and real life application whether you talk about email server or web server there it is mostly used because this raid 0 it give high performance so it is using  that also and Raid  1 data security so it is using this also so it ls the combination of both then next if we talk about RAID 3 RAID 2 is also there but has become absolute in that we break data in bit level that is not used here Now we'll come to RAID 3 in this we break data in block level I've data A I've divided that in bloc blocks means broken data in pieces in pieces and capture data in different disk A1 here and A2 here and A3 here A4 here A5 here and A6 here Breaking original data into 6 pieces and kept it like this So in last you might be seeing that what it is A this is parity bit, means taking parity of data and stored in a different disk all data what we need to dot that along with storing original data its parity is also stored, why we do this parity storing means if one of the disk is failed if one of the disk is failed Still I can recover the data from parity I'll give ls simple example lets say data is 1 and this is 2 and this is data 3 just for an example, I'll tell you with a simple example so if anyone ask you can easily answer that So method of finding parity is adding all of three So 1+2+3 will be it will be 6 so parity 6 we've stored here so like this we have find out its Parity now lets say in future A1 fails A1 disk fails so now how I'll recover the data with the help of parity Parity is 6 and I know how parity was found 1+2+3 so what I'll do I've to find this one take rest of the parity its sum is 5 So will subtract from parity so it will be 5 So see its data is 1 this I'm telling in  a form of example that if 1 disk is failed Still I can recover the data from the parity only 1 disk but if 2 disk fail then we can't do anything then we can't do anything then we can't find with parity as there will be confusion then multiple options can come, so here So here you got the advantage that we broke block level data in blocks made blocks of original and made one parity but what is the problem here problem is that all parity is there in 1 parity data is in hard disk kept parity in different disk problem from this is that in case in case if there if problem came in parity So all the parities will not able to get use second bottle neck can come if anyone read or write, lets say here also write and here also and here also whenever you write or change so you need to change in parity also Parity will change always lets say if I've here instead of 2 I've done 20 then new parity I've to calculate so whenever you'll write then you've to take parity from here So this disk will be used a lot because of this it can came in bottle neck state it will be very usable that it can create problem in accessibility So this problem can come and this problem is solved by next one RAID 4 says what we're doing in RAID 4 same concept but in this we've saved parity in such way in actual there was not much difference in RAID 3 and 4 but this problem is solved by RAID 5 what RAID 5 did All these parities are distributed Parities are distributed Parity in not in 1 disk Now that parities are distributed all disk now there is data and parity both so what will happen because of this because of this no disk will be over utilized all disk will be equally utilized, right operation will be performed well by this as compare to RAID 3 and 4 finally there is RAID 6, this is last,in raid 6 there is little difference in this we are calculating 2 parities instead of 1 we are calculating 2 parities A and A this data A1,A2 and A3 calculated 2 parities of this calculating 2 parties means as in earlier one if 1 disk fails I can recover from 1 parity but if 2 disk fail then it is not possible but here advantage is that if 2 disk also fails still I can recover the data from the parity because I've 2 parities So there are 2 equations so from 2 equations I can find out the value, like we normally do that in one equation x, y value is this and in second it is this so obviously we find out them I mean to say That in RAID six advantage is that from 2 parities if 2 disk fails then that you can easily recover So from all these parameter whatever question comes you can easily explain Thank you

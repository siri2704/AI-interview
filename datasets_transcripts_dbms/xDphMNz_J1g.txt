hey everyone so let's break down the difference between SQL and nosql so SQL stands for structured query language and it is used for structured data so think of it like an organized spreadsheet with rows and columns and it is designed for relational databases but no SQL is used for unstructured data it is super flexible and can handle different types of data formats like documents and graphs it can handle huge volumes of data

Hello and welcome to this first video on Database 
Management System or DBMS. What is DBMS? In DBMS   introduction, let me say that a DBMS is a software 
system that provides a centralized storage and   management of data. A DBMS can be accessed and 
changed by multiple users in an organization.   Examples of DBMS are Microsoft SQL 
Server, Oracle database and MySQL.   Before creating a database in the DBMS, first 
we need to do conceptual database design.   For that, entity relationship model in DBMS 
is a common technique. The Entity relationship   model shows entities that represent objects 
or concepts, for example "Book" or "Purchase"   and the entity relationship model also 
shows relationships between those entities,   for example "Author writes Book". This 
is an entity relationship diagram or ERD   in Wikipedia's weak entity article. Now 
entities are shown in ERD as rectangles.   Here Order, OrderItem, Customer 
and Product are entities.   Now a rectangle or an entity has 
attributes that are shown as ovals,   for example the Order entity has attributes: 
OrderNumber, OrderDate, OrderPaymentInfo and   OrderShippingAddress. OrderNumber attribute 
is underlined because it is the primary key.   Now relationships are shown in ERD as diamond 
shapes, for example Customer entity has a   relationship OrderAuthor with Order. 1 and M 
mean that one Customer entity may be related   to multiple Order entities. A weak entity 
is shown in ERD as a double-lined rectangle.   A weak entity, for example OrderItem cannot 
exist on its own and needs an owner entity   which is the Order entity in this ERD. Here the 
relationship is shown as a double-lined diamond.   1 and M basically mean that one Order entity can 
be related to multiple OrderItem weak entities.   In introduction to DBMS, you should know about the 
relational model because the DBMS depends on it.   The relational model is a mathematical model 
that represents data in the form of relations   or tables. Now each table 
has rows here and columns. Each row represents an individual entity and 
each column represents a single attribute,   for example this row represents the individual 
Customer whose name is "Abe" and this is Abe's   address and this is Abe's CustomerID. This column 
CustomerID represents the CustomerID attribute of   the Customer relation and in every cell it will 
be the individual attribute of that entity. Another relation is the CustomerPhoneNumbers 
relation, which has all these rows and it has   two columns CustomerID and PhoneNumber. Now 
there is a relationship between CustomerID   of CustomerPhoneNumbers relation and the 
CustomerID of the Customer's relation.   So, this is called a foreign key relationship 
. This basically means that the CustomerID   of the CustomerPhoneNumbers is related to 
the CustomerID of the Customer's relation.   Next in this DBMS tutorial is disk storage, which 
refers to the physical storage of data on disks.   One option in DBMS is disk striping or RAID 0.   In disk striping or RAID 0, the data is divided 
into blocks and stored on multiple disks   and in disk striping, the data is 
read in parallel from multiple disks,   improving the performance. But the problem is 
that data will be lost if one of the disk fails.   In disk mirroring or RAID 1, data is 
stored simultaneously on multiple disks.   So this is mirror 1 and this is mirror 2. Because 
the data is mirrored or duplicated across multiple   disks, even if one of the disk fails, the data 
can still be retrieved from another mirrored disk.   In disk duplexing or RAID 0+1, the data is both 
striped as well as mirrored. So, it provides   improved performance and data mirroring. So 
disk duplexing is the best approach among these.   Next in DBMS explanation, hashing and indexing 
are two separate techniques that increase   database performance and fetch data faster. In 
hashing, there is conversion of actual data into   a fixed length value called hash for quick data 
retrieval. The hash was called hash key earlier.   This hash value is used to locate data in a table,   for example the DBMS can convert every Customer 
name to it's hash value and store it in the   same table. So, when you search for a Customer 
name, say "Steve", it will generate the hash and   search only the hashes. So, it can go to that 
particular Customer name faster. The thing to   note is that when searching hashes, the DBMS 
has to do arithmetic comparison with each hash   so it can do it faster than comparing strings. 
In indexing, a separate data structure called an   index is created by the DBMS. Unlike hashes, the 
DBMS indexes are stored separately from the table.   In this video, I explained what is database 
management system using my DBMS notes.   I will upload more DBMS tutorials for beginners 
like this video for example, in the next video   I will explain about schema, DBMS structure 
etc. so please view this complete database   management system full course in the database 
management system in English playlist. Thank you 🙏

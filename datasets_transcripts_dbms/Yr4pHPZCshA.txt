Hello friends! Welcome to Gate Smashers The topic is aggregate functions in SQL Before starting the video, I want to request my viewers That please subscribe my channel And please press the bell button So that you can get latest notifications So today we are going to talk about Aggregate functions in SQL Basically there are 5 aggregate functions Max, Min, Count, Avg and Sum Max means, if you want to find the maximum value Minimum value Count means, total number of values In a table Average and sum Although this topic is a very simple topic Means, You can use it in a simple query With a simple query only, all these functions That actually what work they do That we can find out But, over here what is the concept Than many times in complex queries These aggregate functions are required When we write group by or nested queries Or when we use correlated queries Over there, we need to use these functions So that's why If you will have basic over view clear That what do these functions do And how do they work Then you can comfortably use them in all the queries So we will start with aggregate function First one is Max Max means to find the maximum value And over here I have taken a table Emp In which Eid, Ename, Dept and Salary So over here there are some values in salary Like Eid 1 10000 20000, 30000, 30000, 50000 and Null Null means value is not available Null means it is not 0 Null means the value is empty It is not available with us Which we can also say not defined or not available I will do proper discussion about Null in the further video But, over here you assume Null that the value is not available Means it is empty I don't have that value available So, If we talk about Max If get the query, like If a simple query is asked Find the Eid or we will write just a simple query Find the maximum salary from emp table If this table name is emp Then in this emp table Print the maximum salary So how we will print the maximum salary For that we can use Aggregate function So how will you do Select max(salary), in bracket we write the column name We use the attribute name with the function Max(salary) from Emp, very simple Select max(salary) from emp So what is the maximum from these salaries? 50000 So what answer will I get in the output? 50000 Simple, from the whole data he printed the maximum value of salary If over here I have maximum salary 50000 two times If 50000 was multiple times Then it will print multiple times That the value is actually 50000 Maximum salary is 50000 In this way you can also calculate the minimum value also Minimum value means We have to use the Min Min function so select minimum value Minimum value means what is the minimum value from all these? 10000 So what will come in the output? Answer 10000 Now you might be thinking That, null is also over here Null means Anything Null means Anything, it does not means it is 0 It can be 0, it can be 1 lakh also It can be 5 lakh Means this value is not available with me No one has given me this value So at this place, I can fill any value So irrespective of Null What answer will select Min give? 10000 Means, after leaving the Null, all the values that are there From all that, which is the minimum That will be printed in the output So 10000 will be the answer Then, we use count We can use count as There is a simple method, select count(*) If I do count(*), then what is the meaning of count(*) That how many rows are there in a table In a table, how many rows are there It finds total number of rows , it will print the total number of tuples count So how many rows are there in total table? 1,2,3,4,5,6 so output will be 6 But, if I put * then the output will come, that how many rows are there in a table If over here Instead of * I change it Let's say, select count(salary) Select count(salary) So if you see carefully in salary 10,20,30,30,50, null When you will do select count(salary) Then in output 6 will not come, in output you will get 5 Because, It will not count Null Null means, empty, the value that is empty Then why we should consider it into count? So that's why 1,2,3,4,5 so output will be 5 You can use one more over here Distinct We can use a keyword distinct What is the meaning of distinct keyword Distinct keyword means That I want to find unique values Unique values So if I find unique values, that from salary How many unique values are there? What is there count? so how much is the count of unique? 10,20,30,30 see this So 30 is written 2 times So this is considered 1 time So 1,2,3,4 So what will be the output? 4 Because, distinct, what is the meaning of distinct? Unique values Where ever there will be duplicacy That will not print the duplicates multiple times It will print the duplicate value just 1 time So one time 10000 2 for 20 1 for 30 Means 1,2,3,4 We will not count null because, when we will count in salary Then Null will not be counted So what will come in the output? 4 So select distinct count(salary) from emp Output will be 4 So this is how we use count, max, min Then we can calculate the sum Then we can calculate the sum Select, one method is simple Select sum(salary) Select sum(salary) From table What is the meaning of select sum(salary)? We will add the total of these values 10+20+30+30+50 So output will be  it will be 1,40,000 so output will be 1,40,000 If we are doing just sum(salary) But if I do select distinct sum(salary) Select distinct sum(salary) What is the meaning of distinct sum(salary) It will just take distinct values Where ever there are duplicate values It will consider it just 1 time So how we will calculate? 10+20= 30000 It will count this 1 time 30+30=60 And 60+50=1,10,000 So what will be the output? 1,10,000 Because it will not count 30 2 times It will count 30 just 1 time This is the advantage of using distinct Then average Average is also very simple If we do average Average of salary Many times question comes That find the average salary of a Employee in a Emp table If I want to find out average salary in this table Then how do we find average salary? If we see formula of average Then, how will the average salary be calculated? Sum(salary)/count(salary) Simple What is the formula of average(salary) Sum(salary)/count(salary) What is the sum of all the salaries Sum of all the salaries is 1,40,000 And what is the count? How much is the count of the salary?  1,2,3,4,5 Because, it will not take null into count And we have not used distinct So  rows will come in the output So when 1,40,000 is divided by 5 That will be the answer of average salary But, if over here I use distinct  Distinct, select distinct Avg(salary) So what is the meaning of select distinct Avg(salary) That I will have to use distinct in Sum and in count also I have to use distinct This is the important point So sum(salary), we had already calculated distinct In case of distinct output was 1,10,000 So 1,10,000 will be the output Because, sum of salary distinct 10+20=30 This will be considered 1 time 30+30=60 And 50000 is 1,10,000 And distinct count(salary) Means we are counting salary but distinct So 1,2,3 as 30000 is 2 times It will be considered only 1 time 1,2,3,4 We don't have to consider null So 1,10,000/4 so this will be the output of select distinct avg(salary) from emp Although, all these 5 aggregate functions that we have It is very easy to use them We can use it in a query easily But, when we will do nested queries In nested queries or correlated queries These aggregate functions are used many times So actually when you will know that What is the advantage of these aggregate functions Then you can easily use them in different queries At present in this video I am just telling the basic That what are aggregate functions And how we write the query in the SQL Then when we will discuss about nested queries Over there, from this complete table We will discuss the queries in deep So this is all about the aggregate functions In SQL Thank you

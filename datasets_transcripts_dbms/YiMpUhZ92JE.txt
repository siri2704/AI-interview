[Music] hey guys welcome back to techno tech tv in this tutorial we will discuss enhanced er model in detail so let's start is the complexity of data increased in the late 1980s it became more and more difficult to use the traditional er model for database modeling hence some more improvements or enhancement were made to the existing er model to make it able to handle the complex applications better hence as a part of the enhanced er model along with the other improvements three new concepts were added to the existing er model they were generalization specialization aggregation so let's understand what they are and why were they added to the existing er model generalization is a bottom-up approach in which two lower level entities combine to form a higher level entity so in generalization the higher level entity can also combine with other lower level entities to make further higher level entity it's more like a super class and subclass system but the only difference is the approach which is a bottom-up hence entities are combined to form a more generalized entity in other words sub classes are combined to form a super class for example saving and current account types entities can be generalized and an entity with the name account can be created which covers both next is a specialization [Music] is opposite to generalization it is a top bottom approach in which one higher level entity can be broken down into two lower level entities for example employee entity is an employee management system can be specialized into developer tester etc in this case common attributes like employee name salary employee id become part of a higher level entity that is employed and specialized entity attribute like tester type become part of specialized entity that is a tester next is aggregation year diagram is not capable of representing relationship between an entity and our relationship which may be required in some scenarios so in those cases our relationship with its corresponding entities is aggregated into a higher level entity so basically aggregation is a process when relation between two entities is treated as a single entity so in this diagram the relation between coaching center and course together is acting as an entity which is in a relationship with another entity visitor now in real world if a visitor or a student visits a coaching center he and she will never inquire about the center only or just about the course rather he and she will ask or enquire about both so this is all about enhanced er model hope you learned something new today do share this video with your friends or to spread the knowledge and stay tuned for more videos [Music]

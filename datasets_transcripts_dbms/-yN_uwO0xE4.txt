so now let's discuss the different Keys present in dbms in more detail so the first key we have is the Super Key a Super Key is a set of one or more attributes that taken together can uniquely identify a record in a table in other words a Super Key is a combination of columns that ensures the uniqueness of each record in a table a Super Key ensures that each combination of values in the specified columns is unique across all records in the table super Keys allow for the identification of individual records within a table they provide a means to uniquely reference and retrieve specific data from the database for example let's say we have an employee table that contains the information of the employee now in this table we can make the ID phone email and combination of other attributes as the super key but in this table we cannot make the name as the super key because the name cannot guarantee the uniqueness because more than one employee can have the same name therefore a Super Key can be a column like ID or email number or a combination of columns like name and phone number

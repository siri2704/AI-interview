hello guys welcome to my YouTube channel in this channel I am going to tell about many computer science topic from basic to Advanced today I am going to continue dbms from where I had left today I am going to continue some types of databases there are four types of database user application programmers sophisticated user specialized user nav user are coming to the first application program there are the computer professional who writes application program to interact with the database application programmers uses different types of tools to develop the user interface like rapid application development tool now coming to the second one that is sophisticated user they interact with the system without writing the code they form the request by using a query language now coming to the third one that is specialized user they are the sophisticated user who writes specialized database application that do not fit into the traditional system their rights applications such as computer edit design system knowledge based expert system A system that store complex data type like Graphics data audio data Etc now coming to the last one that is name user they are the unsophisticated user who interact with the system by using one of the permanent application program that have been written previously now coming to the chapter 2 of the dbms that is year diagram what is er diet ER diagram or entity relationship diagram is a conceptual model that gives the graphical representation of The Logical structure of the database it shows all the constraints and relationships that exist among the different components an ER diagram is mainly composed of the following three components that are entity sets attributes and relationships now coming to the entity relationship model what is entity an entity is an object in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects now coming to the types of entity there are two types of entity physical entity conceptual entity now coming to the first physical entity these entities are the object with physical existence example person car student Etc now coming to the conceptual entity these entities are the object having conceptual existence but not physical existence example job course Etc now coming to entity set and attribute what is entity set the entity set is the collection of entities of the same type example set of all students of the college set of all employees of the organization what is attribute every entity is associated with same characteristics and these characteristics are called as at least example the attribute of entity student or name roll number marks Etc now coming to the types of attributes there are six types of attribute first simple attribute second composite attribute third single valued attribute for multi-valued attribute fifth derived attribute 62. now coming to the difference between simple attribute and composite attitude simple attitude simple attribute are those attribute which cannot be divided into sub parts example age of a person composite attribute composite attributes are those attributes which can be divided into sub parts example the name of the person can be divided into first name middle name and last name the difference between single valued attribute and multi-valued attribute single valued attribute and attribute having only a single value for a particular entity is called a single valued attribute for example age of a person now coming to multi-valued attribute an attribute having more than one possible value for a one particular entity is called as multi-valued example phone number now coming to the difference between derived attribute and stored attribute derivative an attribute that can be derived from other known attribute is called as derived attribute example age of an employee can be derived by using the date of birth and system current stored attribute an attribute that cannot be derived from other known attribute is called as stored attribute example date of birth of an employee now coming to relationship what is relationship a relationship is the association among several entities it connects different entities through meaningful relation now coming to relationship set a relationship set is the set of relationship of the same time now coming to the degree of relationship degree of relationship the number of entity participate in a relationship is called as degree of a relationship if two entities participate in a relationship then it is called as binary relationship if 300D participate in a relationship then it is called as ternary relationship now coming to the mapping cardinality what is my mapping cardinality it specifies the number of entities of an entity set associated with another entity said through the relationship now coming to the types of mapping cardinality there are four types of mapping cardinality first one to one relationship second one to many relationship third minute to one relationship food many to many relations thank you that's all um for today from my side if you like my video then like share and subscribe to my channel

hello everyone in the previous video we have seen what are the advantages and disadvantages of dbms now in this video this will be a small topic that is who are the users of dbms who is exactly using the dbms now there are three users of the dbms we can categorize the users in three broad categories that is first one is the application programmers second one is the database administrators and the third one is the end users or you can say that clients application programmers second one is the database administrators and the third one is the end user so application programmers are the one who writes programs or queries in various programming language in various query language to interact with the database so application programmers are the one who writes programs in various programming language to interact with database so they will use different kinds of query languages depend on the database that they are accessing now the next one is the database administrators or database admin are the one who is responsible for managing the entire dbms system and they will be called as a database admin the portion will be called as a database admin who is responsible for managing entire dbms now the last one is the end users end users I think it is clear to everyone these end users are the people who interact with the database management system why are some interfaces they conduct various operations on database like retrieving updating deletion Etc so these are end users or you can say that the clients or users who interact with database via any user interface okay so if any application is there so the user who is interacting with the database will be called as the end users and the application will be called as a user interface and the programmers who are writing the like programs to fetch the data for the end users will be called as the application programmers and the database management system that is managed by the database admin so these are three users of the dbms so I hope these three users is clear to everyone in the next video we will see what is the difference between a dbms and the file system management

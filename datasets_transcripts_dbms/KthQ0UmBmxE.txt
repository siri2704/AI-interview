hi welcome back in this lecture let's quickly take a look into what is orm well orm stands for object relational mapping well object relational mapping is a programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database tables well here application domain model meaning basically java class with some fields and getter setter methods for example here student java class has a field like id first name last name and email on the other hand student's relational database table has columns like id first name last name and email well orm basically map the fields from the student java class with the columns from the students database table for example the id from the student class is directly mapped with the id column from the students table similarly first name last name email from the student java class is directly mapped with first name last name email columns in a student's you know table so that we can directly you know create object of the student class and we can directly store in a student's database table all right so basically we don't have to write a sql statement to insert the records in the students table we can use orem mapping to directly map the objects to the less than database table well in order to understand more about vrm let's take one more example over here here we have application domain model that is address class it has a fields like id street city state country and zip on the other hand we have addresses relational database table it has you know columns like id city country state street and zip code all right so we can use a orm to directly map the fields from the address you know class with the columns of addresses table all right so that whenever we you know persist address class object then all the fields from the object will be directly mapped with the columns of the database table so in java basically we create object of the class using new keyword here right for example look at here we have created object of the address class and we have you know filled a value in a address class object okay and whenever we persist this object into a database table then orm will basically you know map the fields from this object into the fields of database table all right so look at here whenever we persist this address object then that will be saved as a row in a database table so basically we are not going to use a sql statement to insert a values in the database table with the help of orm we can directly store object into relational database table as a row and we can also retrieve a entire row in an object using orm mapping so orm is basically a programming technique that we can use to directly map the application domain model objects to the relational database tables now the question is in java who is responsible to provide object relational mapping well java provides a standard api that is jpa all right we can use jpa to provide object relational mapping in java alright we will see next lecture what is jpa all right i will see you in next lecture

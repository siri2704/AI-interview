hi everyone welcome back to my YouTube channel I am reti and I'm back with another lecture in the dbms series so in the last couple of lectures we got to know more on the SQL part in this particular video we would be learning about intention and extension in databases so without any further Ado let's get started so what is intention intention defines what kind of data can be stored basically the data type and the relationships between them so whenever we discuss about what kind of data that can be stored in a table and what kind of relationships stable can have in between them that is called as intention now this is basically the blueprint or the definition of the database structure so basically in the definition of database we mostly tell that what kind of tables would be there what would be the data which would be present in the tables basically the data type the constraints the table would be having so it basically tells us about the database structure now it doesn't change frequently and its permanent definition of the database structure so it doesn't change frequently because considered but if we have a huge database of employee now in this employee database we might be having a employee details table employee details table and one about employee previous work history table so employe work history table now in these certain tables there is like very less addition of new columns or you can say new set of attributes which are being introduced so there is not a kind of permanent change which happens with very frequently so that is why it is told that it is a permanent definition because the changes are not very frequent yeah maybe there could be a possibility of adding one more or two more new attributes or column but that doesn't occurs very frequently it's very rare so that is why it is called as the permanent definition of database structure now it includes the very first thing table definition so what table definition is basically the name of tables they are columns and the data type allowed in each column so in a database you can have multiple tables what is database database is basically collection of data and tables is basically an intersection of attributes and Tes or you can say rows and columns so here there could be multiple table T1 and T2 so what is this particular table name along with what are are the data types of the data which is being stored then what are the constraints which are provided to this particular data that all things we discuss in intention now the second thing is constraints so constraints are basically the rules that governs the data such as primary key foreign key and data validation rules so constraints basically allows that if this particular data is being stored does it follow this particular rule of a primary key constraint does it it the column shouldn't hold any duplicate values because it is having a primary key constraint if it is having a notnull constraint it shouldn't take any null values so that type of validation rules are performed now the third one is relationship between the tables so there could be a relationship between the table like foreign key primary key relationship where in one table is having a shared column with another table uh there is one foreign key which is present in one table and there is one primary key which is being referenced by that foreign key in another table so there is also a relationship which is established between two tables of databases now here is an example so here we have taken an example of a customer table so this is the table name these are the table attributes or you can say column table columns these are the data types of the attributes or the table column so you can say data types so this proves our first point that it includes the table definition that is name of table their column and data types allowed now the second thing which you can see here is a constraint which is a primary key constraint there is a rule on this ID column that ID should always hold unique as well as notal values it can't hold any duplicated values because of this primary key constraint so it also proves our second point that is it includes constraint now the third one is relationship between tables since here we are discussing only about one table we don't know that if there are more tables in the database which is existing so for now I haven't given any foreign key or primary key relationship but consider that if there are two tables there could be a possibility that a primary key in first table can be acting as a foreign key in second table establishing a foreign key primary key relationship between the tables so in this way a relationship is also defined so intention basically consist of table table name the constraint it has the data type it has the column name it has basically the structure of the database or the structure of the tables which is present inside our database it is the intention in database so let's see what is extension in database the extension is the actual data that is stored in database at a given instance in time so whenever we see the actual data which is stored in database at a given time that is called as extension basically the data which is stored in tle or rows at a given instance of time when there are more tles added the data can change so consider that at a time T1 I am looking at my employee table in this employee table I can see there is ID name and department and there are entry of three people Rahul absara and abhimanu now company hire new individual so whenever they will hire new individual the tle or the row would be filled with new values now if I see my table at time T2 I can see that there are four entries in my table now so a entry for Aditya is newly added at time T2 so at time T1 I was seeing then there were only three people consider after 5 days if I am seeing I can see that there are four people now in that particular employee table consider that after 10 days if I'm seeing the table I can see that there are five entries in the table so Raj is also added newly so at particular instance of time the data which is present in the database is called as extension in database so extension in database is not permanent because there would be more number of employees who would be added there would be some employees who would be also leaving the company so the extension doesn't remains permanent but intention is kind of permanent because in that we basically Define the table structure or the table definition so extension is basically the actual data which is stored at a given instance and time intention is the table structure or you can say table blueprint so this was all about this video I

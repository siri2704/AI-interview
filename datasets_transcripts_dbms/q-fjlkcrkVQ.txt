through the following question here the relation is our a b c d e f g h i and j these are the functional dependencies which are given a B determines C B D determines EF ad determines g h8 remains I and H determines J now the question is like this what is the highest normal form the above relation is in and is it in 2nf if it is not in too inept and coordination tutorial ok so you can see every relational database is by default in one area so we have particular the above relation is in 2nf one for that purposes first of all identify what are the candidate keys for this rotation so how you do that candidate key go to the right hand side of each production and see what are the attributes which are not they here C is presented is present F is present G's present H is present ice wizard and J is present there are three attributes which are not present that is a B and D so first of all to find the carnet get a strike abd closure let us take a bidding ocean if you take a BD closure then abd can identify itself now from the first production a B can determine C plus certain from the second production PD can determine EF because PD we can determine here and because of ad because of AD we can join gh because of a you began determind i because of h we can do my G therefore you can say a BD can determine everything that what a BD is a tiny red key so there are no other candidate keys which are possible for this relation okay now to say that relation is in 2nf we have to check whether it is fully functional dependent of the candidate key or not right so better whether that relation is the relation is fully functionally dependent to fully functionally dependent on candidate key or not or candidate key or not okay so is it fully function depending on for that purpose let us see is that any part of candidate key which is driving other attributes right so you can see from the first production AP is a part of candidate key which is driving the other attributes as well as B D is a part of Kentucky and as you can see a B is a subset of a B D and B D is a subset of a B D right even a D is also a subset of every D a D is also a subset of a B D even this a is also a subset of a B D right because all these are the subsets of apts hence a part of candidate II can drive at random okay so we have to break down this relation to make this relation come into to NF or so - for breaking down we have to see what other attributes which will be the number of relations in which we are going to break it down okay so to see the number of relations let us do one thing so here they are saying that a B is a subset of a BD so that means if I take a be closure if I take a be closer then what are the attributes which we can identify it just with the help of a B a B can determine a B from the first production a we can determine C and with the help of K we can determine pi with the help of a we can determine I okay secondly if we take next production is BD so if you take BD closure then BD can determine beauty itself with the help of BD I can determine EF and third production is 80 so if I take ad crucial PT Cruiser then with the help of ad I can determine a D and G and edge and with the help of I can determine J so these are the things we can determine from this so I'm not taking this production right now because you can clearly see this a is a subset of this so even if I'm going to know I'll try to do it that I will not be able to do this solution properly so I'm just going to solve a BPD and 80 so just you just get to know why I am NOT taking it so you can see with the help of a B I can determine a DCI help of media I can determine PDF with the help of AD I can determine ad GHI right that means I can break this relation into this situation which is the first version will be R 1 which will be having a be CI second relation will be R 2 which are the groups which are be D here third relation will be R 3 we should be having a and the G H I energy these are the attributes further from this relation if you have to see one of the functional dependencies which are that exactly cable on this so the only function dependences which are applicable on this they are a be determined C and a determine spine their application on applicable of this right so next what are the functional dependencies which are applicable on is it is d D determines EF we dint reminds me of is there anything else what are the functional dependencies which are applicable of this they are a determines I H determines J there's something else right and 80 determines G H so these are the functional dependencies which are applicable on this relation now for the first relation where we have broken down those relation this is this relation to enough or not is it in 2nf or not is it in 2nf or not is it into n or not so we have to check that so for the first relation what are the candidate keys you can see or the C and I are in the right hand side so a and B are not included so if we take a be closure that means be able to get b c and i but a part of this candidate key that is only a can determine i that for there is a partial functional dependency which is occurring in this relation so if because of this partial functional dependency we have to break this relation so we have to see what are the things which will be broken so if I take a closure from here then it will be a I so we are going to break this relation to prove further relations assuming those relations are r4 and r5 are filling the containing a PC and okay right so you can further identify but are the functional dependencies which are a particular on our food so for our four you can see a b2 demise see the functional dependency which is applicable but our file you can see a difference is a function dependency which are particular and nothing else is applicable next is see here there is no functional dependency here there is no partial function fancy next integration are two PT determines B F let this only one function dependency which is applicable on this and it can clearly see there is no partial function dependency which is occurring okay now next is r3 in case of r3 you can see we broken down arch into this relation for the solution first of all identify you know candidate keys which are possible for candidate key go to the right hand side and see what other attributes which are not everyone a and D are the attributes which are not agreeable right everything else is the believer so if I take KD closure you can see I'm going to identify a d g h i MJ and part of this that is only a you can identify i therefore we have to break the solution so if I take a closure when a closure is a and PI a closure is a and I and a migrating anything else okay so that means I can break the solution to to play chutes that means the first ratio will be containing R 6 which is a key G H and the second relation will be R 7 which will be a and I right so these are two nations which are possible okay and is there any other candidate fear no so even you can clearly see in and the candidate key we are not having H so this is composed into two relations now further you can see what is the functional dependencies we shall have to get on this you can see the functional dependencies which are applicable on this one is a determines G H and H 2 minus J is not applicable which determines J is not J is also enough so atomize J's applicable further here a determines I is applicable now is it into enough you can see this relation is into enough and this relation is also a tool now you have to tell which are is this complete because we are going to break this complete relation into the it is completely to the nation our food which is containing a b c our 5 which is containing a i we are going to break it into our 2 which is containing p d e and f next is our 6 which is k d g h NJ and extends our 7 which is containing a and i so these are the breakage of this particular relation tell me whether this decomposition is lossless or not lossless or not yes these decompositions are lost to us because we broken the relation on the basis of further gap on the basis of keys only whether this decomposition is functional dependency preserving or not we can clearly see we are only still playing with original set of function dependences we are not added we have not added any function dependency unless we as soon as we have not removed any from 23 LC right so we can clearly see this is this but the competition is FD preserving right so in case of okay so this is called us to enough [Music]

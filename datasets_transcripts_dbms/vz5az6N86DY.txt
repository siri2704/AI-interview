[Music] hello everyone welcome back in this presentation let's focus on the introduction to ER model part one let's start with the topics of the day what are the topics we are going to cover in this presentation at first we are going to understand the basics of the ER model then we will focus on the basic components of the AR model then we will focus on entity entity sets attributes and relationship sets while waiting let's step into the topic of the day the ER model what is this ER model actually the ER model stands for the entity relationship model shortly we are going to talk about what is an entity and how relationship among entities can be formed and why do we need this model anyway for now we are going to understand why do we need ER model and what are the importance of having an ER model in this presentation if you are aware of blueprints we have a lot of advantages of having blueprints in the real world say for example it create a shared understanding of the bigger picture it also helps us in understanding how different parts work or different components work it also enables better communication and outcomes it helps in identifying and explaining the priorities it helps us in in staying focused by zooming in and zooming out for a specific component this ER model is also like a blueprint now let's understand why do we need ER model because this ER model facilitates database design by allowing specifications of an Enterprise schema we know very well that the organizations or Enterprises are going to obviously have databases before constructing the database we obviously need to understand the exact requirement also we need to allow the specifications that are going to be involved in the design so exactly ER model helps us in facilitating the database design how by allowing the specifications of an Enterprise schema this is like before constructing the building the engineers I mean the civil engineers will have a perfect design plan or an approved design plan so that the design plan will help them to exactly implement the construction of the building in a very perfect way as expected if the design is good the implementation will be good at the same time just like that we can't go and implement the building construction so we will plan we will Design isn't it ER model is like that say for example how many relations or tables are required what are the relationship among the tables how many columns are there in the tables or how many attributes are there in the table which is a primary key attribute all these things are actually dealt by the ER model because this is developed in the design phase I hope now you can recollect why did we see the first topic or the first lecture in this chapter just correlate this with the first lecture of this chapter the design phase I hope now you will be able to understand in the design phase only we are going to construct this ER diagram or we are going to deal with the ER model so obviously the ER model represents the overall logical structure of a database and that's why I told you this ER model represents the overall logical structure so when we look at the ER model itself we will be able to understand the complete database design so definitely this is not exactly going to be understandable by the computers but this is a highlevel data model where this helps the database designer or the database administrator to understand the overall logical structure of the database once the structure is created it will be definitely easy for the database administrator or the database designer to implement that in the database hence we can say this ER model develops a conceptual design for the database obviously because this is a conceptual design only I told you this is actually in the database design phase isn't it so this ER model develops a conceptual design for the databases and obviously we know this is representing the overall logical structure of a database so this is portrayed as diagrams I mean the ER model are generally portrayed as diagrams to be precise ER diagrams a picture is worth a th000 Words which conveys its meaning or Essence more effectively than a mere verbal description ER model is portrayed as diagrams we are going to deal elaborately about the ER diagrams in the coming lectures for now we have just dealt about the ER model and the basics of the ER model let's now step into the basic components of the ER model this is an example ER model but this is not depicted to have a complete design of the ER model this is just a part of the ER diagram anyway my intention is just to let you know that an ER diagram the part of the ER diagram will look like this now let's focus on the basic components actually the ER model has three basic components number one The Entity sets number two the attributes and number three relationship sets let's focus on entity sets before understanding entity sets we need to understand what is an entity so the next thing that we are going to understand is what is an entity after understanding an entity let's move on to entity sets so we are now here in understanding what is an entity what is an entity actually this entity is is a thing or object in the real world if you have some knowledge about the objectoriented programming an object is a real world entity isn't it an entity is also like that it is a real world entity or a real world thing or a real world object so when I say this is an object or a thing that is in the real world obviously entity is distinguishable from all other objects because they are the real world entities say for example I'm a different guy my friend is a different guy my brother is a different guy but if we want to represent everyone in one word we can say person so each one of us is a person where each one of us is distinguishable from all other persons so that is what I mean to say entities are real world thing or real world object anyway don't worry about this now when we see an example we will be able to understand things elaborately let's see an example an example is each person in an University is an entity so if we are taking a university as an example database then in the University database each person is an entity so this is a generic way of saying what is an entity each person in an University is an entity so obviously each person will be distinguishable from all other person in the University isn't it an instructor may be a different person a student may be a different person staff may be a different entity so what I mean to say here is each person in an University is an entity and how each person is identified it has a set of properties and the values for some set of properties that may uniquely identify an entity as I told you each person should be uniquely identified only then each person can be distinguishable from all other objects isn't it so when we talk about entity this entity has a set of properties and the values for those set of properties say for example if name is a property and the value for that name will be different for me I have my own name for my brother he has his own name for my friend he has his own name I hope things are clear to you now in this chapter we are going to demystify everything about the ER model and the ER diagram so I told you a generic example isn't it each person in a university is an entity now let's see an instance for example a person may have a person ID property whose value uniquely identifies that person if you take a relation in that relation if you take entity which is actually person I told you each person isn't it which is an entity now in that case the person ID property will uniquely Define each person from other person I mean it uniquely identify each person from other people and that's why these entities are distinguishable from all other object object because these entities has a set of properties and values so that we can uniquely identify an entity I hope you understood the insights about what is an entity now let's see what is an entity sets this is the first component in the basic components of the ER model there are three basic components The Entity sets the relationship sets and the attributes we are now in the entity sets let's focus on this entity sets and entity set is a set of entities we have already seen about entity but what we are seeing now is an entity set is a set of entities of the same type so that share the same Properties or attributes if you take me as an example my name and age for example if I'm taking my name and age if I considering my brother's name and age again you see how many columns are here two columns I am retrieving name age similarly my brothers name and age but I'm considering a set where these two values are there because they have the same type if you see my name is also of the same type as my brother's name my age is also having the same type as my brother's age remember I'm not talking about the value my name is different my brother's name is different my age is different my brother's age may be different but we are talking about the same type or attribute name attribute age attribute so an entity set is a set of entities of the same type because they share the same Properties or attributes let's see a formal example now the example is the set of all people who are instructors at a given University can be defined as the entity set instructor say if we are saying instructor as an entity set what does it mean this instructor entity set means this is the set of all people who are instructors where at a given University because in that university only we will be able to exactly have the set of people who are instructors in that University anyway the next lecture is part two where we are going to deal more about entity sets relationship sets and the basics of attributes for now just understand an entity set is a set of entities of the same type example the set of all people who are instructors at a given University and one thing we need to note here is this entity set does not need to be disjoined I mean to say The Entity sets do not need to be disjointed it means in a university we will be obviously having instructors and student if we take instructors and students are different entity sets and we can still have a person entity where that person may be an instructor or maybe a student isn't it that is what it is meant here that The Entity set does not need to be disjoined we are done with the first basic component which is the entity set let's now move on to the next one attributes if you take person as an entity what are the attributes that person will have or the properties that person will have for example name age salary these are some attributes that defines a person isn't it because entities a real world thing or objects so it has to be described by a set of properties which we call as an attribute let's see that now each entity has a value for each of its attribute I told you if you take me as an example my name is different my brother's name is different so name is the attribute where that has a value my name will be the value for my name attribute for me but that's not the same for my brother my brother name will be there in my brother's name attribute name and that's why I told you each entity has a value for each of its attribute let's see an instance or an example for instance a particular instructor entity may have what I'm am talking about the instructor entity right so instructor is belonging to the university if you take instructor as a relation what are the attributes or columns that instructor entity should have it should have multiple attributes but mainly I'm focusing on few attributes just to explain you what it is it should have an attribute ID it means the instructor ID which should be unique for each instructors so that we can easily identify which instructor we are referring to it should also have name it should also have Department name and salary I'm focusing on these four attributes for the entity instructor so this instructor entity will have ID as the attribute name Department name and salary as the attributes and each instructor will have some value for example one 12121 is the value for the ID attribute for the instructor sujit so the value is going to be sujit for the name attribute the department is finance so sujit is working for finance department and that is why this value Finance is there in the department name and $90,000 or 90,000 Euro or 90,000 whatever it is this is the value for the salary attribute so these four attributes are under the instructor entity and each instructor will have their own set of values so what I mean to say each entity has a value for each of its attributes the attributes are ID name Department name and salary and these are the values which are unique for each person remember multiple instructors may have the same name or they may be working for the same department or they may be drawing the same salary but there should be at least one attribute that uniquely defines each instructor isn't it which is this attribute ID I hope things are clear to you now let's now focus on the last component in the basic components of the ER model which is the relationship sets I hope now you can understand what is an entity an entity is a real world object or a real world thing and these entities are described by attributes isn't it how one entity is related to other entity that is what relationship and relationship sets is all about let's see that now let's take two entities instructor entity and student entity what I mean to say here is for the University database if we are taking instructor as one entity and student as another entity student will have certain attributes like student name student ID student Department etc for instructor instructor ID instructor name instructor Department instructor salary Etc how instructor entity and student entities are related that is what we are talking about in the relationship sets it is actually an association among several entities how instructor and student are related that is what relationship sets are all about example advises instructor and student are related with advises relationship so instructor advises student other examples include borrows what does it mean let's take banking system as an example customer Loan account so customer borrows loan for example so customer is one entity loan is another entity so customer can be related with loan using borrows relationship teachers instructor class or section instructor teaches that particular class isn't it so these are the relationship sets I hope now you can understand what is a relationship set this is actually an association among several entities so what I mean to say is a relationship set is a set of relationships of same type because whenever we say it is a set relationship set or entity set it is a set of relationship of same type this is important let's see the next point so this relationship set is actually a subset of E 1 E2 up to e n such that this E1 belongs to Capital E1 this E2 belongs to Capital E2 and en n belongs to capital N is a relationship set what do we mean by this if you take R is actually a relationship set and this is a subset where this lowercase E1 is a relationship that is belonging to the entity set E1 so lower case E2 is the relationship belonging to entity set Capital E2 so this is how a relationship is actually established I know things will be unclear at this stage no worries I will elaborate about this point in the next presentation so obviously an entity set is the part of an entity that plays in a relationship the entity's role for example instructor advises student so instructor is taking the part of the advisor relationship right so the part of an entity instructor plays in a relationship is the entity's role so instructor is playing advises relationship or the advises role with the student entity so that's why I mentioned the relationship means it is the part of an entity plays in a relationship is actually the entity's role the entity's role may be advises or borrows or teachers or anything I hope things are clear to you now we are done with the relationship sit as well let me now show you the basic components can you see here so if you take this is an entity this entity is described by attributes such as ID name and salary I told you each entity will be having a unique ID isn't it each person will be having a unique value so this is a primary key attribute here and this is the student entity that is described by ID name and credits and how instructor is related with student with the association advises instructor advises student and that's why I told you these three entity sets attributes and relationship sets are the three basic components of er model so what we have covered in this presentation the ER model the basic components The Entity entity sets attributes and relationship sets I hope the session is informative and thank you for watching [Applause] [Music]

foreign have you ever tried finding a specific document in a messy room it is frustrating right the same goes for SQL databases to put it simply normalization helps in organizing data in your database specifically it makes reading from tables easier also you can say that it reduces redundancy and also improves data Integrity let's take an example let's say you have a customer database with duplicate entries for a customer named John Smith two entries have the name John Smith for two different products but it is the same customer not only does this take storage space but also can lead to data inconsistencies and also Errors By normalizing the database that separates customers and their order items into Separate Tables we can reduce redundancy this also makes it easier to manage and query the database

[Music] 3nf says that there should be no transitive dependency for example what is transitive dependency once one value can determine a value based on another value now that's transitive okay that means that we can have confusion somewhere and we can have redundancy somewhere now let's look at the scenario here if a functional if a function determines b and b function determines c therefore a function in terms of c right so let's look at that here in this table destination table has transitive dependency vehicle number determines the fleet number so if 12 ax the plate number 12ax automatic lamp diamonds the flip number one two one three to four cb diamond 504 13 wire white damage 333 while 25 a b determines four five one you can see that so that means that these two even though this guy plate number has relies on or depends on vehicle fleet number at this key but it doesn't depend on these other guys as this key so we can have them pulled out because which means there's always going to be a redundancy here anytime there's one to one there's going to be 12 x now let's go back to the major table and you see where such things are happening all right now let's take a look at this sorry you see this one two one twelve ax one two one twelve x one two one twelve x one two one twelve x see that this repetition going on and we don't want this repetition to continue in our table because that will mean lots of repetition any time um the reception is the kasha the salesperson who wants to go ahead and enter values for the fleet number he must also end up values for the blink number okay why we do we have to allow such repetition why don't we just go ahead and give him an opportunity to enter just one to one and 12 x once then any time he needs such values all he has to do is to look up at the vehicle table and get the value of the fleet number and automatically that will bring up any other information needed about the vehicle okay so we need to split that table so if the vehicle plate number determines from to and price okay so we have here that the vigor plate number determines the fluid number the plate number determines the flip number and the fluid number determines the from two and price all right in this very impression here free number from we also have an issue here where the fluid number determines from price okay and that even if you look at this it now creates some problems because definitely it doesn't belong there so what we need to do is to split the destination table so we split the table into destinations and vehicle tables okay split into destinations and vehicle numbers um tables now destination vehicle table look like this remember we had one two um three these three we will split it and we have destinations so we have from two price speed you can see abuja to lagos ten thousand and project caliber fifteen thousand objective you two thousand five hundred this leaves everything about destination here and there's no more transitive dependency here all right then we have vehicles also having their own issue where we have one two one twelve x five four three two three so we have four unique vehicles here and the vehicles are very well um on their own now you can find out this table had four columns there were repetitions here abuja caliber but now that is not done here because we are only talking about destinations okay so if we combine these two we have a one-to-many relationship here which um sorry a many-to-many relationship and most times we try to avoid many too many complications okay that's one of the rules in database development so we have had this destination table where we said that from and two at the primary key of this table right now these two are the primary key of this table and this is the primary key of this table okay so these two from and to are combined to form a composite key combined key please if you like what i've been doing all along you can go on to support this channel by liking subscribing sharing the content

in this video let us learn to draw an er diagram for library management system so the first step is we need to choose the entities entity is nothing but an object with physical existence or conceptual existence so entity must be an object so in library books will be there so book it is physically present we are able to touch so it is physically present and it is an object therefore book is an entity next member member is the person who is going to the library to get books to take books so therefore member is a person and it is physically present so therefore member is an entity next publisher the one who is making the copies of the books for many audiences so therefore publisher is also a person that person is physically existing so therefore publisher is also an entity we must write the entity name inside a rectangular box so the first rectangular box and i am going to write member second rectangular box i am going to write book third rectangular box i am going to write publisher next attributes attribute is characteristics of entity now member is the entity so members characteristics is the attribute so i should write the attributes inside oval shape so member id so if you're going inside the library to take a book you must be a member of that library an id will be given to you the id will be unique for every person who belongs to that library like whoever has joined in the committee of that library will have unique member id so therefore it is a primary key so i should underline that next name of that member next if the member is a student register number of that student next which department that student belongs to so all these will be the attributes this register number is the register number which is provided in the college next which department computer science i t e c or whatever department next attributes of book book will have a title so name of the book next author of the book next the prize of that book next book or book will also have id which is unique for every book so therefore it is a primary key so i should underline next attributes of publisher name of that person address of that person next publish id also publisher id which is unique for every publisher i should join these entities using a diamond box which is the relationship through lines i should draw and join so this diamond is known as the relationship so inside this diamond i'm going to write borrows and inside this diamond i'm going to write published by so after becoming the member of that library now for example if i have become the member of some library i'll go to that library i'll borrow some book which is needed for me and that book if it is wanted by many members then many copies should be made so that will be made only by the publisher so that book will be published by the publisher so now for example you take some book that is needed by 10 people then 10 copies should be there only then i can provide it to 10 members so publisher should make 10 copies of that book so the member will go to the library and borrow some book that book will be published only by the publisher if you like this video please like subscribe and share it with your friends thank you

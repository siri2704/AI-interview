in this video let us learn to draw an ER diagram for banking system so the first step is we need to identify the entities entity is nothing but an object with physical or conceptual existence and we have to write the entity name inside a rectangular box so the first entity can be a customer so I have to write this customer inside a rectangular box because customer is an entity because customer is physically existing because customer is a person so that's the reason customer is called as an entity next account is called as an entity account if you take it is conceptually existing it is present we cannot physically touch it but it is existing conceptually therefore account is also an entity that's the reason why I have written it inside a rectangular box next if you take loan this is also conceptually existing so it is an entity next if you take branch this is also conceptually existing therefore it is an entity next if you take employee employees a person so physically it will physically a person is present therefore employee is also an entity so totally five entities are there customer Branch account loan and employee the second step is we have to write the corresponding attribute for every single entity now if you take for customer what are all the attributes of customer we should write them in oval shape inside the oval shape so attributes will be written inside the oval shape attribute is nothing but characteristics of entity so characteristics of customer I have to write characteristics of account characteristics of loan like that I have to write for all the entities so if you take customer customer will have a name next customer will have an address next customer will have an ID which must be underlined because customer ID is a primary key for every single customer the ID will be unique if there are two customers Raju and Rani if raju's ID is three the same ID 3 Rani will not be having or any other customer also will not be having next let us write the attributes of account entity what is the balance in the account next account number this account number must be underlined because it is a primary key this account number it will be unique for all accounts it is not going to match with any other account it's going to be unique next if you take loan the attributes of loan can be low number this must be underlined because it is a primary key every loan will be having a unique number next the amount of you have asked for 20 000 loan then that will be the amount next is employee employee will be having attributes like employee name address of the employee then salary of the employee then employee ID it must be underlined because every single employee will be having a unique ID next if you take branch Branch name Branch address next Branch ID it must be underlined because it is a primary key every Branch will be having a unique ID so after writing the corresponding attributes I have to connect all the entities we can connect two entities by using relationship which is nothing but a diamond box I can draw the diamond box in the middle and connect two entities by drawing lines so I can connect them like this so customer has account customer has account then customer belongs to the branch to certain Branch the customer will belong to next customer borrows loans next branch has employees so this is the flow customer will have an account so you're writing customer has account next the customer will belong to a certain branch so we have written belongs to inside this relationship next branch has employee so employees will be working in every branch so the branch has employees next the customer will borrow loan from the bank so there is a relationship between these two entities next so this is the flow customer is having an account then customer will belong to a certain branch in that Branch employees will be present and the customer can also borrow loans from the bank so this is the flow for banking system if you like this video please like subscribe and share it with your friends thank you

monstrance earlier we have discussed about the graph based protocols and we have developed we have discussed two examples for your better understanding now I'm going to discuss about the times time there's protocols what is the drawback of the graph based protocol our earlier will offering this protocol C's but you should know the order of execution per year whereas intentional go to base protocol you should not know the order of execution of the operations in the transaction only thing is that you should know mix plan section again refers to each transaction and lexical that is so the tension invisible bactra-vox in the simple principle says the the holiday among the transactions if you have it should you do you wasn't no each transaction should be to the first which transactions will be executed first second will come to know based on the tensions the ordering among the transactions in the schedule is determined in advance based on the timestamps so what is the meaning for this one is there each transaction we will understand based on the time stamp we can identify what is the order to understand in a proper way and we give a small example you have it should be a smooth which is having a two transaction transaction even a transaction [Music] [Music] so the so so this is the using this okay [Music] [Music] and then you're always good discipline section so you come to know the city lies within us because I'm such a bunch of pigs go to ten times it should be okay now we will discuss about changed and all the Rings which we have seen that any civilised because this is a non central dip now if you are finding the equinoctial dude always it should be according to the timestamp firstly one transaction should be good then three to transaction should be exude this only about this is not I know because now every t2 transaction is intended so it should not exceed t2 first then Thema always it should execute transaction 1 del transaction that is what the order is whatever we will see now you can ask me sir if any operation is saying transaction t2 transaction t1 then what should I do because in conflicts when we draw the polygraph we will find an equation do this one out equal trigger this one if we find this one is red okay if we find this one then what should we do we have to resist the transaction exactly transaction and then we have to roll back now let me discuss with a little sample let me take this a jump loaning for a better understanding okay now we read read it is not a conflict operation it when it is a conflict operation so what it says Riley V 2 because it is a transaction to only write on me when you seeing the transaction one whether they say no or not it is not that way because transaction one has entered into the system first so you should execute all its operation then t2 but this is save the transaction t2 transaction what meaning is that it is saying that first transaction t2 should execute the transaction tema say it is violating the time stamp Oliver okay then what should they do what we should do is that why this problem this problem came because of this rate operation because this right operation is there so this ligand is ready to have a conflict so the hard racing transaction t2 transaction 1 then what should I do we should not execute this right operation and we should do the work back I think everyone know what is meant by roll back roll that means is that all the operations will be rolled back once it is rolled back now if it is executed now see please listen carefully again we because of this operation it is seeing the transaction T and transaction t2 and the transaction t1 which is not allowed because all the strands actually need to execute first all the operations in the transaction 1 it should be excluded then the operations in transaction 2 should be exhibited so because of this one in promise created so we should not include this operation and we should hold roll it back once it is rolled back then this one now we will excellent reason why I am saying is that this reason once we load back then what will happen whose types that will come first because first it was mine then it has been now again I am giving some understand because transaction one is exude firstly I am giving a number which is the transaction t2 timestamp so now it was rolled back so the game is coming back now what will be the honoree what is the tension of this one obviously the tension of the transaction one should be more than the transaction pro because you have rolled back mundane you mean we were started executing so obviously transaction t2 has entered first so that we new transaction t1 attends not live now what we have also we can see the construction t2 and transaction 1 so this is not permitted if you want to find the equivalent we have to I hope you have understood one example for a timestamp intentional base I hope you would have understood a little bit for better understanding and your few more [Music]

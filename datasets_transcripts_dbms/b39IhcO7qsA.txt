students coming to the next topic uh that is the bcnf boyy cord normal form in the previous video I explained about the 3nf uh so now let us see what is this uh bcnf actually it is also referred as this Bo normal form bcnf is also referred as 3.59 F because it is some Advanced version of advanced version of 3nf so that's why we call it as a 3.5 normal form so the another name for this bcnf is 3.5 normal form so what are the conditions to follow for bcnf so the first it should be it is in third normal form and next uh whereas in 3nf the first it should be in 2nf after that there is no transitive dependency in 3nf but here in bcnf it is in first it should be in 3 andf next for every for every functionally dependency that is X determines y means Y is functionally dependent on X here x should be super key of a table so this is the main uh point you have to be remember that so whereas in 3nf there is no Transit dependency uh and whereas in bcnf for every functional dependency that is X determines y means y depends upon X this x should be super key of a table so you have to be checked whether the uh key attribute is a Super Key or not okay so let me take an example for this uh boys BNF so this is a student table student course and the teacher who teaches that course okay so let me take this table so here in this table the fields for this or uh let me take the fields suppose the pinky pinky is doing the course dbms and the teacher is Priya and next lucky so Lu is also dealing with the course studying the course dbms and the related teacher is but here for Lucky the another teacher that is a Madu uh deu COA and who teaches uh Banu next Banu she also learning the course COA the same teacher uh so sorry here the teacher should be the same teacher let take Bano and J dbm M so here only two courses are there uh and the teachers are different teachers are teaching the different cour I mean the same courses this course are teaching different teachers so here so much of rant data is there a multiple data is there so uh in this the key attributes or let me take this keys in this table is let's take student and course both of the keys student and course both are the keys and the functionally dependency is the student course determines the teacher because teacher is a non-key attribute the non-key attribute is fully functionally depend on the key attributes so the functional dependency here is teacher is a non attribute and depends upon the student and codes so what is the problem here so the problem here is teacher is not a Super Key okay here the teacher is not super key but determines the C okay so teacher is not a Super Key but determines the course so now let's convert this table into bcnf so let us see after decomposition uh decomposing uh what is the bcn of tables let take divided the table into two tables student and the course is one table and here a course teacher is another table so here a students are pinky lucky deu uh Banu and JV so these are the student names and the related courses for those students is pink is doing dbms luy is also dbms uh ca ca and dbms so this uh this is one table now coming to the another table so here the courses are only the two courses are there but in this two courses only uh for one for these two courses uh here a CO is teaching both Co subjects are teaching uh only the Banu so you just eliminate the rendant data and take only one value okay here the dbms is teaching in two for two kids uh for two children uh Madu is teaching so just take only one and eliminate the another just eliminate the rant data dbms is teaching uh for one Priya and uh for other students for two students Madu is teaching and COA for two students Banu is teaching so now this table is in uh bcnf how can I say this table is in bcnf because here it is in 3nf why it is in this is no Transit dependency there is no transitive dependency here a determines b b determines here no transitive dependency only two attributes uh will be there here okay and here for every functional dependency this x determines y so X is a Super Key here so this this is a Super Key and this is a Super Key in this table so now this table is in bcnf okay so this is about BNL thank you

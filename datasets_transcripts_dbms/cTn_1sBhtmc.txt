hi everyone welcome to my channel In this I'm going to focus more on SQL interview Please fresh up your SQL concepts and assess yourself Here I'm providing you some basic questions at which you are going to gain confidence Let us see one by one What is SQL here SQL stands for structured query language The main responsibilities include data definition language data manipulation language data control language data query language This is some example I have provided you where you are going to get more confidence So in the next upcoming lecture I'll focus more examples on DDL commands and uh here each one is having their own significance So it is mainly used for database communication You are going to retrieve data and you are going to add data There are so many things you are going to apply the same And the next one difference between where and having Where means it is going to filter the conditions where having means it is going to operate at the group level So first one is related to row level and second one is related to the group level So where is completely used to filter before grouping in having it is going to filter after aggregation Next understanding join types So there are so many joints Why we have to use join you are going to join different rows When you whenever you are having more than one table you have to join it in effective way For this reason you have to use inner join left join right join outer join So for this multiple tables are there and you are going to join it accordingly So please brush up these concepts This type of questions they may ask you during interview So what is inner joint what is left joint what is right joint uh please uh look at my shots and don't skip any video In the upcoming videos I'm going to provide you plenty of examples Please to have patience each and every time I'm going to provide you some examples That is the main reason of this sample interaction point where you are going to get more confident Next is SQL constraints There are so many constraints you are going to satisfy data integrity and accuracy and you are going to validate data based on insertion or modification For this you have to maintain primary key Unique uniqueness should be there Whenever you are applying primary key it will check the uniqueness Foreign key seems not null Unique it is mainly used to achieve not null Next delete versus trunate versus drop Very very very important Delete is mainly used to remove specific only Whereas truncate means table will be there but rows will be deleted Rem will be removed Whereas drop means table is not in use at all Okay This is the main difference Next SQL indexing Why we have to use indexing to know the position of data to act on that to look at the particular position you have to apply indexing This will increase your speed and you are going to retrieve data accordingly Next union versus union all The main purpose of union is to remove only duplicates whereas union all means this include duplicates So that is the main difference Here I have provided some scenario with realtime application which is more faster Okay this is the clearcut picture Next SQL window functions What are the main window functions why we have to use the window functions to calculate table rows you have to manipulate it accordingly For this you have to use road number rank Additionally you have to use dense rank The main purpose of this is to apply ranking purpose For ranking purpose you have to use window function Okay Uh this is the main clearcut picture of the previous one Now normalization Why we have to use normalization whenever you are having duplicate values you are going to remove it in a effective way For this you have to use normalization To measure the uniqueness of that you have need to apply normalization If you see my shots I already picked up an example 1 NF 2N 3 NF four NF PCN Okay And uh this is this is going to divide into plenty of normalizations Number of attributes are there You are going to remove the redundancy 1 NF 2 NF 3 NF Okay I hope this uh presentation works you well which you are going to get awareness in the upcoming videos

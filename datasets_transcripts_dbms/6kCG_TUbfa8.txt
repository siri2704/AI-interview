welcome to my YouTube channel for relationship model subscri relationship model right so an entity relationship model model OKAY describe the structure of a datab with the help of diam which is known as entity relationship diagram so so di okay so an ER model is a design or blueprint of a database that can later be implemented as a database okay blue three main components attributes relationship okay so compute Rel one to one one to many many to one many to many so one by one right so okay so entity uh an entity can be Place person object object event or a concept which stores the data in the database so entity and a unique key okay each sorry every entity is made up of some attributes which represent that EMP student patient object machine product concept ex rectang okay rectangle okay so strong sing rectang rectang so first strong entity an entity represent as rectangle in ER diagram for example in following ER diagram we have entity bank which can be uniquely identifi of allend okay so we an that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and relies relies on the relationship with other entity is called weak entity depend okay independent so uniquely identified identify okay right we entity is represented by double rectangle okay example a bank account can be uniquely identified without knowing the bank to which so cannot be uniquely identified bank account sorry sorry Bank to which account belongs to so bank account is a weak entity okay right so Bank strong entity bank account weak entity right next attributes next topic [Music] attrib attribute describe the properties of an entity okay so an attributes is represent as o in ER diagram so there are five five types ofct simple attribute okaybut okay so first student student first sing okay so attribute that combines of other attributes is known as composite attribute okay for example in student entity student address is compos such as code State country Street City compos combination of other attributes attribute so mulue attribute attribute can hold multiple values for example student pH number okay mulue attributes okay mulue as known multivalue attributes okay so it represent Double Double L okay for example a person have more than one phone numbers so phone number attribute is multiv attribute right next attribute okay so derived attribute is one whose value is dynamic and the derived from another attribute okay it represent by Dash in an ER diagram for example person age is derived attribute as it changes over the time and can be derived from other attribute examp join experience so doted lines okay doted example okay sobute can uniquely identify the en from okay for example student RO number can be uniquely identify a student from a set okay some of other attributes however the text of key attribute is underlined soine underline so key attribute okay right dered mul attribute dou okay so double attributes doted L sorry doted okay Rel Rel it shows the Rel entity the four types of relationship are one to one one to many many to one many to many right so first one to one one entity from one entity from entity set can be associated with at most one entity of entity set for example from one from entity set can be associated with more than one entity of entity set for example itro student point of so many to one right so student has class right next many to many many to many okay so one entity can be associated with more than one entity in vice versa okay so the again model we strong entity single line weak entity double line rectangle okay simple attributes simple attribute single line O Okay so ellip single line ellipse composite combination of okay combination of attributes composite mul attribute dou line dou line ellip der sing line withl relationship okay sorry one many to many right so right okay so modeling for college database a college has many departments each department offer number of courses Department many lectures can work in a department lectures can work only in one Department Department s science dep department for each department there is a department lecture can be headed by only one Department lecture can be headed by each take number ofes can take only one leure student can enr in any number ofes each can any number of students steps to create first identifying entities identifying first identifying entities relationship relen first first relationship okay course by only one lectur okay so a course one course is T by only one lecture one okay so next one department has many lectures but one lecture Belongs to Only One depart one to many next one Department office any number of courses but one particular course can offer by only one Department okay so one to okay right next one department has only one head okay next one course can enroll by many student stent and one student can enroll many course so next attributes for example Department Department D name place okay so next course ID course name duration fees okay so next first name last name address phone number right so student student student RO number first name last name address phone number right okay soes relationship key attributes for example Department Department Ute ID Ute lectur Department Department off okay soent student this student can enroll number of courses a courses can be enrolled by the number of students right so many to many next by many to one okay so department has many lectures many lectures has only one Department okay department head only one one Department thank you Andy

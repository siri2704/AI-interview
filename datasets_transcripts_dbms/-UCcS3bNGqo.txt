cap theorem is made of three elements consistency availability and partition tolerance and according to an American Computer scientist Eric Brewer any distributed data store can provide only two of the three given guarantees let's quickly understand what each of these terms mean consistency is when every single read gets the most recent right or an error availability is when every single read gets a non-error response but it cannot guarantee that it would be the most recent right partition in tolerance means that the system will still continue to process data even if the network partition causes communication errors between subsystems that means if even a network failure occurs the system will still continue to process data to put it simply no distributed system is safe from Network failures and that leaves you with two options consistency or availability now you choose what you want depending on the application for example no SQL based applications choose availability over consistency

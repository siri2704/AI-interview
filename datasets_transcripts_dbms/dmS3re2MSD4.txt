in this video let us learn to draw the ER diagram for the topic electricity bill management system so the first step for drawing the ER diagram is we need to find the entities entity is nothing but an object with physical or conceptual existence and that entity should be written inside a rectangular box so electricity when you look at the word electricity definitely electricity bill is an entity electricity bill is an entity so I'm writing it inside a rectangular box electricity bill is physically existing because you look into the meter and you write so it is physically existing therefore electricity bill is an entity next entity is meter reader this is an entity so I'm writing it inside a rectangular box meter reader is an entity because meter reader is a person a person only will come to our house and will take the reading from the meter so therefore meter reader is an entity next customer so you you know customer is a person therefore customer is an entity next is payment payment is an entity because payment is happening conceptually we are not able to see if you're doing online payment we not able to see that okay but some transactions are happening and the money is been paid for the electricity so therefore payment is conceptually existing therefore it is an entity next reip receip is physically existing because we are able to touch the re therefore this is an entity so these are the five entities we are going to see in this electricity bill management system the second step is we are supposed to write the attributes for every single entity at attribute is nothing but characteristics of each entity separately and that must be written inside oval shape so for electricity bill if you take reading date is one of the attributes and I must write it inside oval shape reading date so on which date the meter reader has read the reading and has noted down so that date is important next due date due date for the payment of the electricity bill next status of the payment whether this customer has paid the electricity bill or is yet to pay and has it exceeded the due date or still the due date is there so for checking all these parameters these are the important attributes next one is ID this is a primary key so I'm underlining it ID is very important it is unique for every single customer's electricity bill so every customer will be getting different bills unique bills so therefore it is unique and it's a primary key so I'm underlining it next amount to be paid so how much amount I have to pay for this month this is one of the important attributes so these are the attributes of electricity bill next attributes of customer name of the customer is an attribute next phone number of the customer is an attribute I'm writing phone number inside double because it is multivalue attribute customer can have more than one phone number now for example if customer is having two phone numbers it is multiv value right two values so multi values next one is ID so what is the customer ID customer ID is unique for every single customer that is why it is a primary key so I'm underlining it next age of the customer next attribute is address of the customer so these are the attributes of the customer entity next payment whether it is through n banking or whether it is through cash or whether it is through paytm or whether it is through GP so these are the various modes in which you can pay some will use net banking some will directly give the cash some will use PTM gpay some will use credit cards so it depends it depends on each individual customer so these are the attributes of payment next recip if you take type of reip is important whether it is a software receip or a hard copy soft copy of the receip is given or hard copy of the receip is given that is important to know next the description on the reip so after paying the electricity bill it is a proof reip is nothing but a proof for us to show that we have paid we have made the electricity bill payment so to show that it is used so we have paid for the electricity the proof for that is the reip next meter reader attributes name of the person who is going to take readings from the meter job ID which is a primary key for that meter reader because that person has joined in that job and he will be having his own ID card where a unique ID will be given to him or her so that is a primary key so I have underlined job ID next phone number of the meter reader again I'm writing this inside double ovs because it is multivalue attribute meter reader can have more more than one phone number so therefore it is multivalue attribute next one can be address of the meter reader next mail ID of the meter reader this again I'm writing inside double oels because meter reader can have more than one email ID therefore it is multivalue attribute so these are the attri attributes of meter reader so we have completed the first two steps the first step was finding the entities and writing inside the rectangular box the Second Step was writing the corresponding attributes for every single entity inside a oval shape the last step is we need to connect two entities by a relationship you just need to draw a line and put a diamond box like this and draw like this and connect the two entities Diamond box is known as relationship so electricity is that electricity bill is read by so inside this o uh inside this diamond box I'm writing read by so electricity bill is read by the meter reader next customer and payment I'm connecting and I'm writing D so customer does the payment next rece re and payment I'm connecting receip for the payment done receip is given for the payment that has been done so the flow goes like this electricity bill that is read by the meter reader who comes to our house that's the customer does the payment for the electricity bill next reip is given for the payment which has been done by the customer so in this flow the ER diagram goes so I hope you all have understood thank you so much much if you like this video please like share and subscribe with your friends

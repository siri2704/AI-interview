hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I will be covering what is relational calculus and then I will explain what is Triple relational calculation domain relational calculus guys I have uploaded a complete abms subject tutorials I will provide a link in description you can watch from there if you are watching this video for the first time don't forget to like share and subscribe to my channel let's get started it first have election what is relational calculus relational calculus is a query language used in dbms to specify what data we want to retrieve from a relational databases gases relational calculus is nothing but it is a query language query is nothing but question for example we will question to our relational database like selector name of the student whose rule number is 21. it is nothing but a question so relational calculus is a query Language by using this query language We can question to our database like what data you want to retrieve from a table this relational calculus is a non-presual query language that Focus only on what to do and not how to do it for example if you consider relational algebra relation algebra is a partial query language procedural query language mean it will focus both on what to do and as well as how to do it but whereas relational calculus is a non-presidential query language that means it Focus only on what to do and cannot specify how to do it I'll give an example this simple example for example there is Trend table now I want to select complete record of strength whose rule number is 21. so for that purpose I need to write this relational algebra operation that is Select the sigma stands for select select rule number equal to 21 from student table so whenever you perform this operation I'll get output it will display complete record option whose rule number is 21 so I'll get output names I rule number 21 here what I want to do is I want to select complete record option whose rule number is 21 and how can we do it we can do it by using selection operator the sigma symbol this is relational algebra operation so in relational algebra operation we specify what to do and as well as how to do it how to do it is nothing but will give procedure in order to find a book query so we call relational algebra as procedural query language and whereas in relational calculus we'll focus only on what to do and we will not focus on how to do so we call this relational calculus as non-provicial query language that means we will not give any brochure to solve a book query so it is a non-presidential query language that Focus only on what to do and not how to do it it will not describe about how query will work or how data will be fetched just it will explain what to do that's it there are two forms of relational calculus they are Tuple relational calculus and domain relational calculus infection what is Tuple relational calculus gas Tuple is nothing but rho or we also call Tuple as record Tuple relational calculus is a non-presual query language that is used to retrieve data from relational databases if you want to retrieve data from tables then you can use triple relational calculus it is used for selecting tuples in a relation if certain condition is true these conditions are based on values present in rows of database table guys I will give an example so that you can clearly understand what is this triple relational calculus this is syntax of triple relational calculus weight T stands for Tuple right here bar and right here condition of t weight T stands for Tuple and condition of T is nothing but here we need to give condition in order to select tuples and we need to represent this in curly braces for example there is stable Shrine stable condenses information now I want to select complete recourse of students whose age is greater than 20. guys here a message is 21. Suresh age is 21 rajash is 23. now we need to select this entire three recursors output guys just remember that this Tuple relational calculus will select enter Tube Plus output integrable is nothing but it will select enter record as output so it will display name agent as well as grade of these three students Ramesh Suresh and Rajesh now I will write relational calculus query for this this is relational calculus query so open curly braces insert curly braces at first serenis s is nothing but we are selecting complete tuples so just a written here is gas tuples are nothing but rows bar from which table we are selecting from swing stable we are selecting complete tables so just a retain your students of s various students is stable name and here we need to give condition I don't want to select complete tuples I want to select only tuples whose age is greater than 20 so gesture return H dot h greater than 20. so it will select complete tuples of students whose age is greater than 20 this is my output this is known as triple relational calculus if you want to select complete record that is if you want to select complete your post from table based on certain condition then you can use triple relational calculus triple variables are class one to two types they are three variables and next one is bounded variables variables which do not contains for all and there exist in condition is known as free variables and Tuple variables with for all and their existing condition is known as bounded variables and next I will explain what is German relational calculus whereas triple mean rows or records and whereas domain columns I don't want to select complete record just I want to select name column so for that purpose you can use domain relational calculus domain relational calculus is same like Tuple relational calculus here we will select columns from a table based on condition it is also a non-presential query language that means it Focus only on what to do and not how to do it in domain relational calculus we'll apply conditional columns not on tuples this is index inside Carly places you need to select columns and you need to give condition for columns so C1 C2 C3 so on CNR columns and whereas F of C1 C2 C3 so once in its condition the same example I don't want to select complete record just I want to select name column just I want to select name Columns of students whose age is greater than 20 barrier a stands for Tuple so instead of writing is you need to write your name.is name dot is that mean I want to select only name column this is your man relational calculus query and this is my output for example I want to select only grade column so just in place of writing name just write your grade

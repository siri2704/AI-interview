good morning everyone this is rishali in our last sessions we discussed about ddl commands with practical demonstrations i have mentioned that particular video and database management system playlist link in below description box now in this session we will learn about dml commands with practical demonstrations so let's see so first sql commands as we discussed earlier what exactly sql commands sql commands they want to perform the communication between the different tables and these different tables have stored into the particular database so basically they perform the communication between the tables and between the database there are total four types of sql commands like ddl dml dcl and tcl we already discussed ddl commands like create alter drop and truncate in previous session here we discuss about dml commands like select insert update and delete so let's see one by one commands so first exa what exactly dml commands dml stands for data manipulation language manipulation this word stands for to perform different operations on the data right so by using dml commands we need to perform different operations like access store modify update delete this operations on the particular table that's why dml commands it work on the particular data and this data have present in particular table like ddl command work on the structure of table dml command is work on the particular data that present in table there are total four dml commands like select insert update and delete so let's see first the first command is insert command insert command generally used to insert the data into the row of the table so this is the syntax of that particular uh insert command like insert into table name you have to mention the column names values this keyword is used with insert and put the values of that particular columns and another syntax is no need to mention the column names while creating table you already mentioned the column names right so insert into table name values and put the values there so let's see this with practical demonstrations so here i'm using my sql workbench so for performing insert update delete operation you need to first create the table so how to create cr cr eit create table so our table name is student student suppose 12 okay now our column name so our first column is id which is integer type data is there and not null constraints is there not null means no duplicate values are present in id column right next is first name okay or we can take the name only name and name data type is varchar that is integer type of data and the size of this name characters is 20 and next one is marks so marks marks is integer type of data and their size is 2 right and next one is city is also character type of data that is worker and their size is 20 right now next here here student id is a primary key so you have to mention the primary key that is primary key this keyword and mention your column name that is id right so we already discussed keys in dbms in our previous session okay so just watch that particular video so this is a test syntax of create table so just select all this query and press ctrl shift enter see here your table have created so create command just show the structure of the table how to display by using select command see here select star star means all rows from particular table student student 12 semicolon so just select all this query ctrl shift enter see here this is the structure of table id name marks and city now you need to put up the values into the particular table how to put up see here first insert into student table that is student table s t u d n t okay this is your student table table name insert into table name values okay so as per your columns that have mentioned in create command so first is id so mention the ids one the name suppose the name is in inverted comma that is character type def data so mention the name neha okay next is marks suppose marks is 20 that is integer types of data and city city is also character type of data so ct is pune okay next you need to mention again more than one records in the particular table okay so again mention comma and mention the data like uh next id is 2 suppose a student name is rahul comma and student marks is suppose 40. and suppose ct is mumbai okay and mention the semicolon so in this way you need to add multiple records into your table so just select this query and press ctrl shift enter see here two records have added into the table so this below a particular description box shows the action whatever the particular actions are performed now again execute this query select star from student 12 control shift enter see here this table have created id name mark city and two records have added so this is a work of insert command right now next the next dml command is update command update command generally used to update or modify the value in particular column suppose you want to update the value of particular column so at that time update command have used so what is the syntax see here a bit table name set set keyword is always used with update command okay so update table name set you have to mention the column name and their values again column name and their values okay as per your requirement and mention the where condition where condition always used with the update command okay so let's see how to use this command with practically now as per our table we need to update the particular student id 2 okay this is the 2 student id and their name is rahul and their marks is 40. suppose if you need to change the marks of that particular name of that particular student suppose we need to change rahul to a particular name that is amol okay in this way so how to change by using update command see here update table uh wait a minute the syntax is update table name okay so update and our table name is student 12 okay and always use set keyword with update set so you need to change uh rahul this name with amul okay where student id equal to 2 so where is the condition that mention the student id equal to 2 so uh our column name is name name equal to that is amol okay so you need to change the name amul but which student student 2 that's why i mentioned here where where is the condition okay where student sorry where our column name is id id equal to 2 and mention the semicolon here okay see update student 12 update table name set name equal to a mole this is a update or this is a modification okay with condition where id equal to 2 so just execute this command ctrl shift enter see here one rows affected now you need to change their updation and modification again execute this command select star from student control shift enter see here first there is a name rahul now there is a name is amul so in this way update command have used or you can change marks of the student you can change city of that particular student by using update command means you can update or modify the data in particular table now the next dml command is select command so as we say select command is used to retrial the data from database or we can say display the particular table okay for that purpose select commands have used so by you can use select command from multiple ways select star from student this particular command is used to star means complete rows it can display complete table okay suppose if you want to display particular columns in table so you have to mention select the column names from table okay and next way suppose if you want to display data of roll number two so at that time you can use this select command select star from student you need to use where condition where roll number equal to two in this way okay so let's see with practical demonstrations see when you execute this command select star from student so at that time this table have created right means it display all the tables all the rows from the tables now if you want to display only two columns like name and marks so how to display see here select star so at the place of the star you need to mention the column name select name the next one is marks from student 12 your particular table name right yeah now just execute this query wait a minute so just execute this query ctrl shift enter see here it display only two columns name and marks right now again execute this query select star from student so it can display a complete table right now again next use is suppose if you want to display the particular student id to data okay only two data so select star from student 12 this is your table name where student id where id our column name is id okay id equal to two means whatever the particular student which na id is two only this data have display okay only this data will display ctrl shift enter see here student id 2 only the particular student details have display so that's why this select command have used now the next one is delete so delete command generally used to remove one or more rows from the table if you want to delete the rows in table at the time delete command have used so for the condition is syntax is delete from table name where condition so where this particular condition always used with the delete command uh just see here suppose if you want to uh just first see your table select star from student file okay execute this command so this is your table right suppose if you want to delete the particular uh row where name is neha okay if you want to remove this first row in particular uh table so how to delete see here delete delete from your table name student well okay where where is generally used for condition purpose where the name equal to neha right means if you want to delete a record which name is neha so just execute this query ctrl shift enter see here wait a minute just a second okay suppose if you want to mention here id let's see here suppose if you want to delete the student which id is 2 because we declare as a primary key for id just execute this command yes see here this rows have affected now just show your complete table here see here the particular student id is 2 this particular row have deleted and remaining data is as it is so this is a work of delete command so in this way dml commands have work thank you keep learning

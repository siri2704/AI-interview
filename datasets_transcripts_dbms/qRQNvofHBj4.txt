hello students welcome to SV technology additional features of er mode as a part of the extended ER model along with the improvements two concepts were added to existing ER model those are generalization specialization aggregation key constraints participation constraints weak and strong entities class hierarchical Etc coming to the generalization it is a process of extracting common common properties from a setup entities and create a generalized entity from it it is a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities can be combined to form a high level entity if they have same attribute in common that is surpluses are combined to make super class it is used to emphasize the similarities among lower level entity set and to hide differences in the schema here I have given an example for generalization representation here we have car bus truck like three vehicles are here these three are different entities I am making together and saying as vehicle consider we have three sub entities car bus and truck then these three entities can be generalized into one high level entity or super plus named as weight this is bottom up approach specialization specialization is opposite of generalization in specialization an entity is broke down into sub entities based on their behavior and characteristics specialization is the drop down approach where higher level entity is locked down into two or more lower level entities specialization is used to identify the subset of an entity set that sets some different characteristics specialization can be repeatedly applied to refine the schema of a design here I have given same example for specialization also here breaking is an entity which is high level entity divided into three sub entities named as car bus and truck based on their characteristics and attributes so this is top down approach aggregation is used when we need to express a relationship among relationship aggregation is an abstraction through which relationships are treated as higher level entities station is a process when a relationship between two entities is considered as a single entity again this single entity has a relationship with the entity here I have given a diagrammatic representation of aggregation here A and B are two entities having relationship R so total this relationship R1 is having relationship with C that is R2 so this is relationship among the relationships called aggregation here we can take another example patient and doctor has the relationship with the feeling okay like this we can represent aggregation representation class hierarchies class hierarchies can be viewed in one of two ways that is suppose if we take people student can be a graduate undergraduate part-time or football team here if we take employees academic or non-academic or permanent or contract like this we can categorize the people in me specialized into students and employees specialization is top down approach which we have learned before topic specialization is the process of high referenda subset of super class entity set that shares some special attributes student and employees can be generalized into people generalization is bottom of approach as we learned in before slides generalization is the process of identifying common characteristics collection of entity sets and creating a new set that processes these characteristics so totally class hierarchy is what based on the generalization and specialization Concepts next built and strong entities so we know that an entity which depends on other entity to have survival is known as weekend treatment strong entity is not dependent on any other T is the in the schema a strong entity will always have a primary click weak entity will use the primary key to Define which entity strong entities are represented by a single rectangle the relationship of two strong entities is represented by a single Diamond various strong entities when combined together create a strong entities set here weak entity is depends on strong entity to ensure its existence unlike a strong entity a weak entity does not have any primary key it instead has a partial discriminator key a weak entity is represented by double rectangle the relation between one strong entity and one weak entity is represented by a Double Diamond or rhombus this relationship is also known as identifying relationship participation constraints in a relationship part expression constraint specifies the existence of an entity when it is related to another entity in a relationship type it is also called minimum cardinality constraint this constant specifies the number of instances of an entity that can participate in a relationship type there are two types of participation punishments totals participation and partial participation coming to the total participation each entity in the entity set is involved in at least one relationship in a relationship cell that is the number of relationship in every entity is involved is greater than zero if we take employee is an entity and department is an entity an employee works for Department this relationship is total participation means every employee should be part of any one of Department means all the M plus is going to participate in all the Departments means total employees are going to participate in work that is total participation next one person participation each entity in entity set may or may not occur at least one relationship in a relationship set for example consider two entities employee and department and they are related to each other via manages relationship an employee must manage a department he or she could be the head of the department but not every employee in the company manages the department so participation of employee in the managers relationship type is partial the only a particular set of employees will be manage the department but not all here the only one employee can manage the department so here all the employees are not participating in manages relationship so it is called as partial participation means in employees total if we consider 10 employees are there only one employee is going to participate in manages so it is called personal participation key constraints keys are the entity set that is used to identify an entity within its entities set uniquely an entity set can have multiple keys but out of which one key will be the primary key a primary key can contain a unique and null value in the relational tab so this is all about additional features

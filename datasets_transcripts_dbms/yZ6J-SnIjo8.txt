[Music] good afternoon students today we will discuss about the file management so till now we have discussed about the transaction management normalization all these things so now we will start about the five management file management mainly talks about how we are physically storing the data okay so whereas we see that database is a connection of files because if we see that we have a database which is a direction of their wills and table suction effect records and the record is a collection of fields okay so here we will talk how we are storing it now how we are storing it is we have a database management system which will take care about how to retrieve the data and in operating system whenever we are retrieving a fight supposing them we are they will retrieve in your video from the operating system whereas if we have video we will retrieve a jumper your video whereas in a database if we are reprovingly we will retrieve a one of the curve or a few records and if the term you not to reduce the impact table sometimes so that's why database management system will take the help of the operating system but it will not depend on or take the help of the operating system so database management system will have the specific codes how to fetch the data effectively so as I said every database is a collection of files and each file is a collection of records and record is a sequence of fields so I would refer this okay which is a collection of files and the files is the caption of some records and the records is fees so everything without the regards you have a specific blocks in cache will be we have lines and we have in the second degree we have the paces the virtual management says virtual memory concept so here we have the blocks so how we are storing their records and how to effectively store the records all these things we will study in the five minutes meant a concept so we will discuss about the how these blocks are stored and how the records are stored in the memory okay so now we will discuss about the strategy for storing the records in a block because it blow up the consists of Carlos records okay so as I said let me a file is a collection of wake up so we have a fine which will be stored in me now if I have a run file which will be divided into blocks block 1 block 3 so on now in each block we will have set off because this may be record 1 they talk to like that we have a set of Records so we will discuss about how this is effectively story so we have two strategies for storing the consonant block one is Spanish magazine one is the span and strategy for storing records in a row and second one is an expand statuses so we have push that is for storing records in a block one is Spanish strategy and another one is unspun strategy so now in this video we will discuss a what is a standard strategy and whatever wonders of Spanish fantasy and what are the design context of fantasy similarly we will discuss about what is a transparent strategy what are the wonders of it and what are the disadvantages so first we'll discuss about the Spanish strategy how their thoughts will be stored in a block okay so in the spanish strategy okay before discussing upon the spanish strategy let me discuss what is a blocking fact because the spanish and what is it blocking factor blocking sucker will tell us how many are average number of average number of retards in block because we are saying that block is collection of records in a block we have set off the cards so blocking factor will tell me however is number of Records in a block okay for my records I always they can keep him in block will be identified with the help of blocking factor now come to the Spanish that is your store in the records in your block now as I said we have a because now let's take the time we have a block okay which capacity is fight will be young let's understand infinity then I have 5 20 MB of it block 1 block size is by 20 MP ok so now each record is hung and let's say that I have this one can be so how many regards I don't keep I can keep a record one I can keep the car - I can keep record please I think even a third foot I can keep finding Parts I can't keep because ie how far you'll record sweeties are 500 MB so remaining 20 MB will be there okay I'll just turn it on we have a block of size 5 20 MB and each record size is 100 MB so if I won't be happy I can keep fire codes and 20 away will be there now coming to the Spanish courtesy it will not wish to make this 20 MB it will keep the record six in record 6 we have homicide files they are 600 M so what we do is there in the block 1 it will keep the first 20 feet value 20 so if we we will keep the remaining part we'll keep it in the block - then you can ask you what is the advantage what is the advantage is that we are not very into memory if we do not kept the part of the record 6 here then 20 MB we will be wasted to avoid the wastage of memory they have one for the Spanish strategy in Spanish strategy we have the 20 MB of memory where we can keep the record 6 some part of the record 6 we will keep here and the remaining part we will keep in the block then you can ask me what is the drawback of so what is the drawback of the Spanish strategy Drabek of the Spanish strategies if I want to access the record since if I want to access the record 6 how many blocks I have to access I'll just block one and also how to access the block - so the drawback of the Spanish strategies the number of block access will be more but the advantage is that it avoids the memory business now you can ask me where this valid strategy will be useful the Spanish strategy will be useful for us when the records are of different sizes when they are recourses are not unified then we will go for the Spanish Steps so I hope everyone has understood what is this fantasy now let me go for the unspent shells understand strategy in Kalispell strategy the same one if we have 522 degree of block sense and the record size is the proxies is Phi 20 MB and the record says is hundred M village needed so recording one will be kept record sizes under him now we try to I can keep without for click outside and the 20 MP will get it okay so now whether we keep the record 6 I will not keep the record 6 here part of English Spanish and we kept the part of the record 6 here and remaining part we have to fill the block 2 whereas in unspent strategy we will leave this space for free and then we will keep the record 6 in block number ok so what is the profit the drama is that we are wasting the memory and what is the point is the number of block access and reduce because if I want to access any particular record I can access a little blow up on it suppose if I want to access the core number 5 I have access to only block number one if I want to access the record number six I will access the block number two so the advantage is that the number of block access is less but the drawback is that we are missing the market now where this unspent Ranse will be useful is when the record sales are fixed when the record sales are fixed we will go for the unspent strategy so I hope you have understood and finally we can organize the records in two ways one is the ordered file organization and second one is unordered file organization what is not the ordered file now 22 means if all the records are in the sorted order all because of Records we will store in a file okay if all the records are ordered in a sorted order then we will say that it is in order file organization so in this one the records are the customer stored in how do we mean all I can say that in sorted order stored in sorted order whereas unknotted file illumination that we taught some students often panic okay the records are stored in unsorted order then we will call it as an unordered fight organization now come to the ordered side of management discuss what are their voltages of ibex file organization and what are the drawbacks of order federalization similarly they have one place and decide what this of unmodified augmentation so as we discussed earlier the ordered file menu change between how the records are stored in the Sun over so in this is about ordered by God machine the drawbacks and images if all the because in the field in a five is in a fight if all them with cards are stored in solder on the card one return to return to me so on record p.m. if all that because sub-stories a sorted order what is the advantage that point is is searching will be easy because if all the files are ordered in the sorted order I do not play by innocent because the city will be busy because I cannot play on a if all the numbers are in the sorted order we already discussed we can operate binary search so I thought I think everyone knowing it what is the binary search and how it will go but I will not discuss about the binary search in me all these things will not discuss about the pie message but if the files are stored in them if all the records are stored in the sorted order we can equate the binary search and I think everyone now what is the average time complexity of the binary search the average time complexity of the binary search so if I want to solo it will have log in page two if I want to access any record in the audit file so now let's turn complexities blog in base two as we are applying the binary search then what is the drama so you are telling that what is that what is this - there was artistic what is the traffic the traffic is there if I want to insert a miracle suppose that strange that here hundred records are there if I want to insert some 99 meter like that R 1 R 2 R ends of our 98 is resting on hundred each day now if I want to insert of 99 there might have to strap them in so if I have a shift with them in the next position and I have to Vincent are 99 so is difficult in the so difficult so they are storing unsoldered order now if they are stored in hands on your order what is the searching algorithm we can apply we can apply the linear search if it is a linear search I can apply them Lina switches them if I operate the lineage the average 10 complexities to okay if I want to search in record I have to go for an average of young by 200 they can serve them the Gopher 50 record access then what is the importance is that the advantage is that we can insert any record easy because they are not stored in sorted if I want to Stinson are making me select again because they have not started up so in this video we have discussed about how the records are stored in a file we have two mechanisms one is the order file organization and second one is another file organization okay thank you so much

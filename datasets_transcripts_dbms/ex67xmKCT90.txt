hello everyone in this video we will be discussing about schema the schema of the database is simply means The Logical representation of the database logical representation means how the database is going to be organized what are the different tables it will consist and what are the relationships between the tables so these type of things the schema will Define so you can say that schema is a logical representation or overall design or you can say that the skeleton structure of the database two schema is a logical representation or overall design or skeleton structure of the entire database so it will Define how the data is going to be organized in the database how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated so it will also give you the idea about what are the different tables will present in the database and what type of attributes it will contain for example if we talk about a student table okay just Suppose there is a student table so there will be some attributes or you can say that columns that are associated with the student table so student and if we create a table then what are the different attributes that can be associated with the student it can be the ID or you can say that the roll number or registration ID name age there can be class also in which class the student is studying okay and let's suppose date of birth so these five ID name age class and date of birth these five are the attributes okay these are the attributes of the student table okay this is the table name so there will be a student table and this is the attributes of the students now Suppose there is also another table called course now course attributes can be course ID okay course name it can be course name duration means how long the course will take to complete like three months four months six months these kind of attributes are of the course table now there will be some relationship between the student and the course and what is the relationship student will study a course okay Suppose there is a student and he is studying the course so like suppose data analytics or data science so that is the course and he is studying so studying will be the relationship between the student and the course so that is something the schema will represent it will represent there is a student table his attributes sorry it's tables attributes are these there is a course table in the database and its attribute are this and these are connected with a relationship that is studying relationship so that is something the schema will represent it also formulates the constraints that will be applied on the data on the table so all the constraints it will also give you the idea about the constraints that are applied on the table so overall schema of the database will give you the idea how the database is created how the database will going to be implemented what are the tables and what are the relationships and attributes are going to be created in the database database schema are represented by the visual diagram we will also study about the entity relationships model OKAY ER model that will also help us to create the entity relationship diagrams this schema is designed by the database designers so there will be database designer database designers who will design the schema of the database schema of the data base so database designers are the one who are responsible for creating the schema of the database so that they can help the programmers who are going to create a software application or any kind of application that will interact with the database so when they are creating any applications that will interact with the database so if they have the idea about how the table and the relationships are associated in the database then they can provide them in the applications also so they have to do coding and all the stuffs so that if they have the knowledge of if they have the information about what are the tables and what are the attributes present in the tables then they like it will help in creating the code useful and the process of database creation is called the data modeling so schema contains object like tables their columns or you can say that attributes the data type of the attributes that are stored in the table how they are stored for example stored procedure relationship and some of the information about the keys like what are primary Keys what attribute is foreign key in the table what attribute is like primary key and the candidate key these type of if like this type of information is given by the schema diagram now what are the different keys for example primary key foreign key and other Keys we will discuss in the further videos so I hope you understand the schema well so let's discuss about what are the different types of schema if we talk about the types of schema then there are three types of database schema first one is The Logical schema second physical schema and the third one is view schema you can like also say these three types as the level of abstraction or the types of data abstraction you can also say logical level physical level and the view level so let's discuss all of them one by one so first we will start with the physical schema physical schema or you can say that internal schema internal schema or internal level so it is the lowest level of data abstraction and it Define the physical storage structure of the database So Physical schema defines the physical storage of the database physical to read of the database it gives the idea about how the data will be stored in a secondary storage in forms like file indices Etc so it gives you the idea about all the information about the actual representation of the entire database that is stored in a secondary storage it never deals with the physical devices instead internal schema views a physical device as a collection of physical pages let's discuss about the logical schema logical schema you can say logical schema as conceptual conceptual schema so conceptual schema describes the design of a database at the conceptual level so conceptual level is also known as a logical level so logical schema logical level and conceptual schema conceptual level okay so it describes the structure of the whole database it will describes what data to be stored in the database and also will describes the relationship among the data what data are going to be stored what will be the relationships between the data these type of information will be described by The Logical schema so it describes what data to be stored in the database and what relationship exists among them so it describes the overall structure of the database structure of database it will hide the information about the physical storage so that like information given by the physical schema logical schema will hide those information and will focus only on the data types entities relationships Etc so it hides information given by the physical schema so as it is hiding some information so like that's why it will come in levels of the data abstraction one level will hide the information about the other level in this level or schema the information is given of the entities its attributes relationships Etc now the last one is the view schema view schema is also known as the external schema that describes the information at the external level or the view level at this level the database will contain several schemas and that several schemas will be called as a sub schema so add this level database contains several schema called sub schema and sub schema is used to describe the different view of the database each sub schema will describe the database part that a particular user group will be interested in and like it will hide all the remaining informations that are not interested by the like if a user is not interested in some information that will be hidden by this schema so it will Define how the data will be shown to the user to different user the schema Will based on the interest of the different users so it will describe how the end users will interact with the database systems so there may be n number of sub schemas for each database for the specific view by the user there will be different schema so there may be n number of sub schemas depending on the users interest so it describes the part of the database which Pacific user interested in so this might be confusing like different users will see different like different parts of the database so let's understand this via example Suppose there is a university now in the University database there will be different kinds of tables for the students PS for the students information for the teacher information faculty information for the faculty salary details and some course details some subjects details these type of different kinds of table present in the database now there will be different View for the student there will be different View for the teachers there will be different View for the dean or you can say that principle so Suppose there will be an examination going on in the University now whenever the student will see the home page where the marks should be like it should be uploaded on the home page but there it is written coming soon or something like that but that database is accessing by the faculties to enter the marks in the table so there will be different View student can only see the like exam dates and the information about the examination but teachers can see the marks details also students can see their information course information examination information fee structure but a teacher can see its salary details the marks of the students and the different kinds of things that students are performing so there will be different views of the database that is specific to the students and some part of like some part of the database is specific to the teachers propose in the company also in a business in a company there are employees data also employees data can be seen by all the employees so that is one part or like one view of the database and there will be a CEO or finance department that can see the salary details of the employees or how many leaves how many lops are there so these kind of information will only be accessed by the financial department so that is how the different views of the database is designed at the external level or the view level and that design is called as the view schema that how the user will going to see its details so that's all for the schema and the types of schema in the next lecture in the next video we will see the three level schema of the database or you can say three schema architecture that we will discuss in the next video thank you
